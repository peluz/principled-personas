"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

3 bolts"
"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The value increased by 150% of its original value after repairs. The original value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The increase in value is 150% of $130,000. To find 150% of $130,000, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \times 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repairs) from the new value of the house:
\[ 325,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for all the chickens is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can determine the cost for pairs of glasses:
- The first glass in a pair costs $5.
- The second glass in a pair costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair of glasses is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can find out how many pairs of glasses he will buy:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 8 pairs of glasses:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse based on the relationships provided.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

**Final Answer**: 260"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file at the normal rate of 2 GB/minute.

40% of 200 GB is:
\[ 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she has to download the entire 200 GB again.

The time to download the entire 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding up all the times:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to download the file is:
\[ \boxed{160 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from his home.

1. **Initial Trip to the Turnaround Point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He then drove 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered on the return trip = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"First, we calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%. First, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \]

Then, we subtract this from the second month's total to find the third month's downloads:
\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: $90
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3
- Number of lemons grown per year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5

The net profit per year from selling lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

The net cost per year (including the initial planting cost and the annual maintenance cost) is:
\[ \$3 \text{ (water and feed)} \]

So, the net profit per year after the initial year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we need to determine how many years of net profit of $7.5 are required to cover $90. This can be calculated as:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. 

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire class enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit for each purchase option.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry purchase to maximize profit, which would be $125.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to sum the distances traveled in each direction.

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Since both trains follow the same route and travel the same distances, the total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled in both directions.

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance westward} + \text{Distance northward}
\]

\[
\text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in one week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she eats:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time Marissa has to hike the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to hike:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Calculate the year Raymond had his son:**
   - Since we know Samantha was 25 when Raymond was born, and Raymond was 23 when he had his son, we can find out how many years after Raymond was born he had his son.
   - The difference in age between when Raymond had his son and when he was born is \(23 + 6 = 29\) years.

4. **Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born:**
   - Since Samantha is currently 31, and Raymond's son was born 29 years after Raymond was born, we can find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born by subtracting 29 from Samantha's current age.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born \(31 - 29 = 2\) years ago.

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."

2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

"First, we need to determine how many servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, over 60 days, she will consume:

\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons required is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:

\[45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}\]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, calculate the daily care hours for one dog:
0.5 hours/day

Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog/day = 5 hours/day

Next, calculate the weekly care hours:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Final Answer:**
70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 

Half of Raymond's jewels is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

\[ 4 \text{ points} + 1 \text{ point} = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:

\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

**Total points scored: 9**"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John has $30 left and he originally had $195, and he has already spent $160 on video games and has $5 left, it means he has no lego sets left to count. The calculation confirms that all 13 lego sets were sold.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then use the formula for speed: speed = total distance / total time.

1. **Total Distance:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time:**
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, so each of those days he runs for \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours.
   - Therefore, the total time for the other two days is \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours.
   - Adding the time from all three days, the total time is \(3 + 3 = 6\) hours.

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
   - Speed = \(60 \text{ miles} / 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}\).

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s, then Ben’s iPhone is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s, Brandon’s iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

First, calculate the throwing distance with the gemstone:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Final answer:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories one serving of chips contains:
\[ 250 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Now, we calculate how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can find out how many grams correspond to 0.8 servings:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 0.8 \times 60 \text{ grams} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, you can eat:
\[ \boxed{48 \text{ grams}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, we divide the total number of candles by 10:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

**Final Answer:**
104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

First, let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. So, the number of Post-it notes left after work is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after all this, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The wire is 4 feet long, so in inches, it is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to calculate the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, we can find out how many toys need to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- For car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)

Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)

Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480\)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday had higher revenue, we compare Thursday's revenue to Friday's revenue:

Difference in revenue: \(\$520 - \$480 = \$40\)

The mechanic earned \(\$40\) more on Thursday."
"First, we need to determine the number of adopted kittens the Doubtfire sisters are driving home with. They have 7 kittens.

Next, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy, the first cat, has had. According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, Patchy has had 21 kittens.

The problem also states that Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens from the adopted group and the two house cats to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has:
\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving her with \(30 - 2 = 28\) lollipops.

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

1. The cost of one movie ticket is $7.
2. The cost of popcorn is $7.
3. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this $14 with his $42.

4. We divide the total amount of money Peter has by the cost of one trip to the movies: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and apply the given conditions.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The company charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information given.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity:

\[ \text{Miles on a Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people.
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

\[ \boxed{595} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

1. Calculate the total allowance received over 8 weeks:
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract the total allowance from the final total amount of money:
   \[
   100 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. That's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, since she charges $15.00 per student, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Judy makes in 1 week is \(\boxed{7425}\)."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

\[20 + 40 = 60\]

Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

First, calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each.
- Money from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129.

Next, calculate the money raised from selling cheesecake slices:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each.
- Money from cheesecake slices = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92.

Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total money raised:
- Total money raised = $129 + $92 = $221.

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest is applied.

Each cell phone costs $150, and Shiela bought five of them:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
\[ 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

So, the total cost including interest is:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"

\$36 + \$18 + \$34 = \$88
\]

So, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\)."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **4th level (top level):** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **2nd level:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **1st level (bottom level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ 7.5 \]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then express this in terms of the number of bags.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final numerical answer:**
2 bags"

"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we know a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed so far is:

\[ \text{Total water distributed} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is directly proportional to the duration).

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three alarms:
\[ 4 \text{ (first alarm)} + 4 \text{ (second alarm)} + 2 \text{ (third alarm)} = 10 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is:
\[

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Annual Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% every year for employees who have stayed for five years.

3. **Salary Calculation After 5 Years**: Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, her salary will be increased by 10% at the end of the fifth year. The new salary after 5 years is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10) = 600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ per month}
   \]
   Therefore, her annual salary after 5 years is:
   \[
   660 \times 12 = 7920 \text{ per year}
   \]

4. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for the next three years. We need to calculate her salary for each of these three years.

   - **After 6 Years**:
     \[
     \text{Salary} = 7920 \times 1.10 = 8712 \text{ per year}

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the amount of potato salad for the adults:**
   - Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of potato salad for the children:**
   - Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed:**
   - Total for adults: 200 lbs.
   - Total for children: 25 lbs.
   - Total: \( 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \).

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information given.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we add up the total number of pets:
\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28\]

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To find out how old Jackson is, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children based on the information given.

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Corey is \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Therefore, Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster, which is equivalent to running 90% of his original time (since 100% - 10% = 90%).

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Now, we calculate the number of rabbits:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, we find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

Final answer:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans were used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces of sauce}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit.
- Originally, there were 30 cars.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, minus the cars that took an exit. This can be written as:
\[ x + 20 - 5 \]

Since the total number of cars originally on the motorway is 30, and all of them either drove through the traffic jam or took an exit, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 30 - 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away:

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away:

The number of potted plants she will have left is the total number of potted plants she already has minus the number of potted plants she will give away:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday to the number of plants she will have left after giving some away:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

The total number of doorbell rings is \( 175 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day for the next 4 days.

**6 pages per day**"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together, we get:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given rate of coverage and the total distance to be covered.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"

"First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height.

The inner volume of one box is:
\[3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and subtract the known durations.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the other days:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours (two 1-hour episodes).

Adding these up:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).

According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
- Cost per gallon = $3.00
- Number of gallons = 10
- Total cost = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
- Cashback per gallon = $0.20
- Number of gallons = 10
- Total cashback = $0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.
- Final cost = Total cost - Total cashback
- Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Therefore, the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then determine the average, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, let's find the total number of fruit roll-ups both of them ate combined:
- The total number of fruit roll-ups is \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
- The average number of fruit roll-ups is \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, we need to determine how far Julia needs to row to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance to the shore as follows:

\[
\text{Distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of teachers**: 4
2. **Lessons per teacher per day**: 2
3. **Cleanings per lesson**: 3

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day for all teachers combined:
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Lessons per teacher per day} \]
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = \text{Total lessons per day} \times \text{Cleanings per lesson} \]
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     300 = 50x
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the new prices after the 50% increase.

4. **New price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price = \$10.
   - Increase = 50% of \$10 = \( 0.50 \times \$10 = \$5 \).
   - New price = \$10 + \$5 = \$15.

5. **New price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price = \$16.
   - Increase = 50% of \$16 = \( 0.50 \times \$16 = \$8 \).
   - New price = \$16 + \$8 = \$24.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price.

6. **Total selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board = \$15.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

7. **Total selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board = \$24.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

8. **Total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Selling price of 2x4x10 boards + Selling price of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total selling price = \$150 + \$120 = \$270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

9. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost
   - Profit = \$270 - \$180 = \$90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

Solving for x:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the ratio part for sugar (7) by the value of x:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine Lylah's initial salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as \( L \).

\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000.

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (40%) from her initial salary of $30,769.23, we calculate her new salary as follows:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.692 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later.

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

"Sadie's sleep pattern for the week can be broken down as follows:

1. **Monday**: She slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept each day and then sum them up:

- **Monday**: 8 hours
- **Tuesday**: 6 hours
- **Wednesday**: 6 hours
- **Thursday**: 7 hours
- **Friday**: 7 hours

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can start by calculating the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

3. **Total cost for watermelons:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons.
   - Total cost for watermelons = \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for peppers:**
   - Dillon buys 20 peppers.
   - Total cost for peppers = \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.

5. **Total cost for oranges:**
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges.
   - Total cost for oranges = \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

6. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total amount = Cost of watermelons + Cost of peppers + Cost of oranges
   - Total amount = \(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**."

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure in June.

1. Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.
2. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so we subtract $60 from $500 to find his June expenditure:
   \[
   500 - 60 = 440
   \]
   Therefore, Joseph's expenditure in June was $440.

3. To find the total expenditure for both months, we add the expenditures of May and June:
   \[
   500 + 440 = 940
   \]

Thus, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took and then the total number of tickets used.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ rides} \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ rides} \]

Together, Pam and Fred took:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ rides} \]

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:

"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:
\[ 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we calculate the monthly cost:
\[ \text{Monthly cost} = \text{Number of car washes per month} \times \text{Cost per car wash} \]
\[ \text{Monthly cost} = 4 \times 15 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost:
\[ \text{Yearly cost} = \text{Monthly cost} \times \text{Number of months in a year} \]
\[ \text{Yearly cost} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \]

So, Tom pays \(\boxed{720}\) dollars in a year for car washes."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Brian now has 15 video games. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

**Final Answer:**
Bobby has 40 video games."
"First, we determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- Cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each: \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
- Cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)
- Cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

Adding these together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee on the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, adding the $5.00 tip:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

So, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[29.00\]"
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

**First Test:**
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions left incomplete in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

**Second Test:**
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions left incomplete in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

**Total Questions Left Incomplete:**
\[ \text{Total questions left incomplete} = \text{Questions left incomplete in the first test} + \text{Questions left incomplete in the second test} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"First, let's determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]
\[ B = 2Q \]

Now substitute these into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items and will not be taxed.

The cost of the non-food items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we apply a 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 (original cost) + $1 (tax) = $11

Next, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the cost of the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
Total cost = $5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for supplies per client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:**
   - John has 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - He can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (since 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

   Therefore, the number of pineapples per hectare per year is:
   \[
   100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares:**
   - John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.

   Therefore, the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares per year is:
   \[
   400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
4000 pineapples"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. Let's calculate the number of pieces in each set:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces from all three sets to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 30 bees = 15 bees.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 2 times the number that left in the first 6 hours = 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 12 hours and hadn't already returned. 
   - Bees that left in the first 12 hours: 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees.
   - Bees that returned in the first 12 hours: 15 bees.
   - Therefore, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours: 90 (total bees that left) - 15 (bees that returned earlier) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **75**."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Money given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Money given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can substitute and solve for Dorothy's friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Next, we need to find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:

"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet to match the units of the speeds given. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles
- Convert to feet: \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute
- Time taken: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles
- Convert to feet: \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute
- Time taken: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, and the loser is Tim. The difference in their times is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

**4 minutes**"
"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each bike has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}

- Each pack contains 6 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with $10.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon took two-thirds, the remaining fries were \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what was there before the raccoon took its share. So, before the raccoon, there were \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, the total is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, the total is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes."
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}

"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Next, 2 of these tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday would be:

\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**

"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price Increase Rate**: 20% of the original price every two months

First, let's calculate the price after each 2-month period.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**After 2 months:**
- Increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
- New Price = $20 + $4 = $24

**After 4 months:**
- Increase = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
- New Price = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

**After 6 months:**
- Increase = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
- New Price = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

**After 8 months:**
- Increase = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
- New Price = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

**After 10 months:**
- Increase = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944
- New Price = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

**After 12 months:**
- Increase = 20% of $49.7664 = 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328
- New Price = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968

**After 14 months:**

"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \$50 \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Total lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference:**
   - Net difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Net difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we add these costs together to find the total expenditure:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

We can break this down step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 157 = 1478
\]
\[
1478 + 74 = 1552
\]
\[
1552 + 102 = 1654
\]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[
1654 - 1500 = 154
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she requires to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into this equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

1. Twice the money Ethel has: \(2 \times 8 = 16\)
2. Add $2 to that amount: \(16 + 2 = 18\)

So, Jimmy has $18. 

Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item in the uniform:

1. **Hat Cost**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Jacket Cost**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. **Pants Cost**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Hat Cost} + \text{Jacket Cost}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Hat Cost} + \text{Jacket Cost} + \text{Pants Cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum up the total legs from all the creatures:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of each bird and then sum these ages.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's Age:**
   - Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

2. **Sally Four's Age:**
   - Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   - Therefore, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

3. **Granny Red's Age:**
   - Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   - Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.

4. **Sally Two's Age:**
   - Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   - Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = \(8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 41\)

**The total age of the four birds is 41 years.**"
"First, we need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and he has 60 potatoes, the total time for peeling is:

\[ 1.5 \, \text{minutes/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 90 \, \text{minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato, the total time for cutting is:

\[ 5 \, \text{seconds/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 300 \, \text{seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ 300 \, \text{seconds} \div 60 = 5 \, \text{minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together to get the total prep time:

\[ 90 \, \text{minutes} + 5 \, \text{minutes} = 95 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of lemons and sugar based on the profit they made.

First, let's establish the relationship between the cost, revenue, and profit.

1. **Cost per gallon:**
   - Lemons: $3
   - Sugar: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon for $0.50 each.
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Profit per gallon:**
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Total profit:**
   - They made a total profit of $25.

5. **Number of gallons sold:**
   - Since the profit per gallon is $5, the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit is:
   - Number of gallons = Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

6. **Total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, the total amount spent on lemons is $15."
"First, let's determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know the total number of Asians is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
\[
\text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
\[
\text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after all these expenses and donations.
\[
\text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. **Bo's crabs**: Given that Bo has 40 crabs.
2. **Monic's crabs**: Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, Monic has:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs}
   \]
3. **Rani's crabs**: Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, Rani has:
   \[
   36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[
40 \text{ (Bo's crabs)} + 36 \text{ (Monic's crabs)} + 46 \text{ (Rani's crabs)} = 122
\]

**Final numerical answer:**
\[

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks together:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and that this number is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find out how old Jean is.

First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was \(30 - 2 = 28\).

Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).

So, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Since this was two years ago, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

**Final Answer:**
Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner takes:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner takes:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner takes:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed and the given conditions.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of rats is unknown, but we can denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of hamsters is unknown, but we can denote the number of hamsters in each cage as \( h \).

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits.
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw:**
   - The total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces.

We are given that the total straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces. The rabbits use 20 pieces of straw, so the straw used by the rats and hamsters is:
\[ 160 - 20 = 140 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Now, let's calculate the straw used by the rats and hamsters:

- **Rats:**
  - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
  - There are 3 cages, and each cage has \( r \) rats.
  - Total straw for rats: \( 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r \)

- **Hamsters:**
  - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
  - There are 10 cages, and each cage has \( h \) hamsters.
  - Total straw for hamsters: \( 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h \)

The total straw used by the rats and hamsters is:
\[ 18r + 50h = 140 \]

We need to find the number of rats in each cage (\( r \)). To do this, we need to find a combination of \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfies the equation. Since the problem does not provide the number of hamsters, we can assume that the hamsters are not contributing to the straw count for the small rodents, and thus \( h = 0 \).

Substituting \( h = 0 \) into the equation:
\[ 18r = 140 \]

Solving for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem implies an equal distribution, we need to re-evaluate the assumption. Given the problem constraints, the most logical and feasible solution is to assume the hamsters are not contributing to the straw count for the small rodents, and thus the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ r = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each month.

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

**Final Answer:**
$106.12"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying and the transportation cost.
   - Total cost = \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue for \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. First, convert the hours into minutes:

Therefore, John collects \(\boxed{360}\) peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

First, calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- There are 10 ducks in the flock.
- Therefore, the total weekly requirement is \(3.5 \times 10 = 35\) pounds.

Next, calculate the daily requirement:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The daily requirement is \(35 \div 7 = 5\) pounds.

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

At noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 5 crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each of the 40 restaurants is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

23786 - 8417 = 15369
15369 - 9092 = 6277

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month Collection:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month Collection:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third Month Collection:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences, Publisher B pays:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

So, Baldur gets \(\boxed{55}\) liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we apply the 5% raise to his annual salary. A 5% raise on $104000 is calculated as:

\[ 104000 \times 0.05 = 5200 \]

So, his new annual salary after the raise is:

\[ 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Additionally, John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, the total amount of money John makes that year, including the award, is:

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate the cheese usage for each part.

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the requirement**: Brinley can remove the lowest score from the six tests and then calculate the average of the remaining five scores to achieve an average of 93.

2. **List the scores**: Brinley's scores so far are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.

3. **Identify the lowest score**: The lowest score among the five tests is 71.

4. **Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to average 93**:
   - The formula for the average of the five tests is:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the five scores}}{5}
     \]
   - We need the average to be 93, so:
     \[
     93 = \frac{\text{Sum of the five scores}}{5}
     \]
   - Solving for the sum of the five scores:
     \[
     \text{Sum of the five scores} = 93 \times 5 = 465
     \]

5. **Calculate the sum of the scores excluding the lowest score (71)**:
   - The sum of the scores excluding 71 is:
     \[
     89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
     \]

6. **Determine the required score on the sixth test**:
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of the five highest scores (including \( x \)) should be 465:
     \[
     367 + x = 465

"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g}
\]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g}
\]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g}

"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn. Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her earnings from mowing the lawn are:
\[ 4x \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, her total earnings from both babysitting and mowing the lawn, plus her savings, are:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \text{ dollars} \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) such that her total earnings equal or exceed the total cost of the items:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time Gary spends walking this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) taken to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:
\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her hourly wage is $8.00. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months.

The total payment over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total payment from the total amount to be returned.

The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, and then subtract their total from the overall total of 251 points.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
   \[
   \text{Half of Naomi's points} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total Points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]

5. **Jojo's Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's points can be calculated by subtracting the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251.
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Jojo scored 54 points."

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.

Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants \(90 - 40 = 50\) petunias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:
\[90 + 50 = 140\]

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \( 180 \text{ dollars} \)."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car, it takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total travel time for the round trip is the sum of the days for each leg of the journey:
\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days."
"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- After losing 8 water type cards, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards.
- After buying 14 grass type cards, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type card. The probability is given by the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, then multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the added items:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the upgrade cost:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, we calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

This means 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially, and the remaining watermelons were:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 more watermelons were ready for harvest, and the remaining watermelons after this harvest were:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to find the subtotal.

\[ \text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the subtotal to find the total amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. Given that there were 50 ants, the number of bugs would be:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

**Total number of insects in the garden: 75**"
"Initially, there are 36 penguins sunbathing.

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that have left from the initial number:
\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes they both eat per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat per week is:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has enough empty pens.

Let's calculate the total number of pens step by step:

- **First Cycle**: 
  - He uses 25 pens, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Second Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Third Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Fourth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Fifth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Sixth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Seventh Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Eighth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Ninth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Tenth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

After the tenth cycle, he will have 5 new pens and 20 empty pens. Since he can no longer make more pens (as he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen and he only has 20 empty pens), the process stops here.

Adding up all the pens he has:
- Initial pens: 25
- Pens made in cycles: 5 (from each of the 10 cycles)

Total pens = 25 (initial) + 5 * 10 (from cycles) = 25 + 50 = 75

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is **75**."
"Johnny initially took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount of money he had was:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

He then invested this $30, and it tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount of money he had after a year was:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, the final amount of money Johnny had after a year is:

   \]

2. Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of Jessa, Joan, and Mary:
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68
\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This leaves:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 280 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count each book being read once.

- Dolly reads her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book = 3 books.
- Pandora reads her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books by the end.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from his pen pals each week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in response. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes each week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages (responses)} + 30 \text{ pages (replies)} = 60 \text{ pages} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing each week is:

\[ 60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's allowance:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24 fries.
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after Ginger gave: \(9 + x\) fries.
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:** 
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\).

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final answer:**
Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since the makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

So, Jean paid:

\[ \$27,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies each person ate on both days and then convert those amounts into calories.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on Monday.**

- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on Tuesday.**

- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies each person ate over the two days.**

- Sue's sister's total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue's total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

**Step 4: Convert the total number of cookies into calories.**

- Each cookie has 200 calories.
- Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

**Step 5: Calculate the difference in calories consumed.**

- Difference in calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

**Final Answer:**
Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students, the total number of students is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is:
\[ 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls in the school. Since the school is equally divided between boys and girls, the number of girls is also:
\[ 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \]

We know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- First class: 15 girls
- Second class: 12 girls

The total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:
\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let the number of cougars killed today be \( x \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3x \).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( x = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Thus, today Rick killed \( 3x = 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves and 12 cougars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:
- Wolves: \( 10 + 36 = 46 \)
- Cougars: \( 15 + 12 = 27 \)

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is \( 46 + 27 = 73 \).

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's slides:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Adding these new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, the total number of cows in each stall becomes:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:
\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 1 penny is equal to $0.01, the total value of the pennies is:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, the total value of the nickels is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to $0.10, the total value of the dimes is:
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = 2 \text{ dollars}

"First, calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, determine the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, they ate:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original weight to find the remaining weight of the redwood:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

\[

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. First, we sum up the apples and bananas each person has:

- Andrea's total fruits: \( 52 \text{ apples} + 24 \text{ bananas} = 76 \)
- Jamal's total fruits: \( 44 \text{ apples} + 48 \text{ bananas} = 92 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of fruits:

\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: \(36 + 30 = 66\) cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pennies in the stack:**
   - The cup contains 9,300 pennies.
   - We need to find two thirds of 9,300 pennies.
   - Calculate two thirds: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300\).

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3}\).
   - Simplify the multiplication: \(2 \times 9,300 = 18,600\).
   - Now, divide by 3: \(\frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200\).

3. **Convert the number of pennies to dollars:**
   - Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100.
   - \(6,200 \div 100 = 62\).

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(\boxed{62}\)."

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

So, 24 cards had the letter B. This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

So, 15 cards had the letter C. This leaves us with:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging both small and large holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- Therefore, the total time for small holes is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- Therefore, the total time for large holes is \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, we add the time for both small and large holes:
- Total time in minutes = \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, \(240\) minutes is \(\frac{240}{60} = 4\) hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- Including the 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

\[
\frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
     \[
     8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length:
     \[
     25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - To find the number of beads, divide the remaining length by the length of one bead:
     \[
     \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
     \]

Therefore, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these totals together:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(360\)."
"Ann's brother is currently twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is \(9 \times 2 = 18\) years old.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the first five rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the first five rows from the total number of stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars make up these 40 stars. We do this by dividing the remaining stars by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

Final numerical answer:
\[
8
\]"
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour and the distance is the same (480 miles), we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Calculating the right side of the equation:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars each child will get is:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

So, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times \$5/\text{interval} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Susan earns \(\boxed{75}\) dollars for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike's total points: 22
- Jim's total points: 18
- Tony's total points: 43

Adding these together gives:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

\[
\boxed{83}
\]"
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of exercise over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:
\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{370}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members eating rice at each meal, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's sum up the crates sold:

- Weekend sales: 20 crates
- Tuesday sales: 15 crates
- Wednesday sales: 12 crates
- Thursday sales: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   - Each of the 3 other people bids once, and each bid increases by $50 from the previous bid.
   - The first additional bid by another participant: \(200 + 50 = 250\)
   - The second additional bid by another participant: \(250 + 50 = 300\)
   - The third additional bid by another participant: \(300 + 50 = 350\)

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants, so she bids 3 times.
   - Her first bid: \(350 + 50 = 400\)
   - Her second bid: \(400 + 50 = 450\)
   - Her third bid: \(450 + 50 = 500\)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of all the bids:
     \[
     200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 450 + 500
     \]

5. **Calculation:**
   - Adding the bids step-by-step:
     \[
     200 + 250 = 450
     \]
     \[
     450 + 300 = 750
     \]
     \[
     750 + 350 = 1100
     \]
     \[
     1100 + 400 = 1500
     \]
     \[
     1500 + 450 = 1950
     \]
     \[
     1950 + 500 = 2450

Thus, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is \(\boxed{2450}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to break down the costs into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 60 miles each day and goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 300 miles per week and works 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 50 weeks in a year, which is approximately 12 months (since \(50 \div 4 \approx 12.5\), we can consider 12 months for simplicity in this context), so the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the bonuses, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for the driving service is **$31800**."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded in half vertically, it creates two pages on the front and two pages on the back. This means that each piece of paper can print 4 pages in total (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

2. **Pages per Piece of Paper**: Since 4 pages are printed per piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 4.

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

**Final Answer:**
8"
"Annika spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

The amount left is:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount left is \(\boxed{15}\) dollars."
"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of books sold in the first year
Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since she sold 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of books sold in the second year
We know the total number of books in the collection is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

The number of books sold in the second year can be calculated by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[ 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year
Each book sells for $20, so the total earnings from the books sold in the second year are:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked per day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Days worked per week} = 100 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 500 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, we need to add the weekly bonus to his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} = \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} + \text{Weekly bonus} = 500 \, \text{dollars} + 300 \, \text{dollars} = 800 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} \times \text{Number of weeks in April} = 800 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales, we subtract the morning sales from the total production:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. According to the problem, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, we calculate half of the remaining 20 loaves:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are split equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, we determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight per week as Joey, which is 2 pounds per week. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, Sandy will lose:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, the answer to how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much you will save, let's first calculate the savings for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Savings on ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

2. **Savings on milk:**
   - Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Now, let's calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

- **Total savings on ice cream:**
  - Savings per tub: $2
  - Number of tubs: 2
  - Total savings on ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

- **Total savings on milk:**
  - Discount per packet: $0.5
  - Number of packets: 4
  - Total savings on milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

- **Total savings:**
  - Total savings on ice cream: $4
  - Total savings on milk: $2
  - Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

**Final numerical answer:**
You will save $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
   \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs consumed daily by the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, in a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

**Final Answer:**
91"
"Given that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can determine Jane's age as follows:

\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:

\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \(D\).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \(2D\).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \(\frac{1}{2}D\).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[3.5D = 105\]

To find \(D\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:
\[D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30\]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people showed up:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. Therefore, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Adding the 20 marbles Solomon bought and the 8 marbles his father gave him, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of girls**: Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of nongendered children**: The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total number of children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. If \( W = 45 \), then the number of poles \( P \) can be calculated by the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
6. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total is:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people left after an hour. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means 10 people left the party. Therefore, the number of people who stayed at the party is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find out how many women stayed, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"The book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = \text{Total number of pencils} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Number of loose pencils} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 \]

So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since Jam has 3 boxes and these boxes contain 24 pencils, the number of pencils per box is:
\[ \text{Number of pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, let's consider the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:
\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = \text{Pencils Jam has} + \text{Pencils Meg has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, assuming each box can hold 8 pencils, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.

2. **Effect on Coffee Strength from Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters weaker.

3. **Effect on Coffee Strength from Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   - Total weakening = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people trade and leave with 7 new records.

First, we calculate the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for each new record, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."

   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\):
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. The coupon applied twice the amount of the reward, so the coupon value is:

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount the customer would have paid without the reward and the coupon:

\[ \text{Total without rewards and coupon} = 43 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the reward and the coupon value from the total:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

**Furniture United's Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 months * $350 = $2,100

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + Monthly installments
= $1,350 + $2,100
= $3,450

**Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 months * $250 = $2,250

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + Monthly installments
= $1,100 + $2,250
= $3,350

**Cost Difference:**
Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
= $3,450 - $3,350
= $100

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the students are split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).
2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]
3. The total number of animals is 60, so:
   \[
   H + C = 60
   \]
4. Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the equation \( H + C = 60 \):
   \[
   2C + C = 60
   \]
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   \[
   C = 20
   \]
5. Now, we can find the number of chickens:
   \[
   H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

6. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = (20 \times 4) + (40 \times 2) = 80 + 80 = 160
   \]

The total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To find the total number of legs from the tables, we need to calculate the legs from each type of table and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ 310 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:
\[ 2 \text{ shirts} \times \$30 \text{ per shirt} = \$60 \]

Next, calculate the discount amount:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$60 = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24 \]

Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find the final amount Davos paid:
\[ \$60 - \$24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid \(\$36\) for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in daily revenue:

\[ \text{Difference in revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job to find the total amount of money she has:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save:

2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Step 1: The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Since the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Step 2: The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, and then see how many friends can fit within her $90 budget.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   - One round of mini-golf costs $5.

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person:**
   - One ride on the go-karts costs $10.
   - Morgan and her friends will ride the go-karts twice.
   - Therefore, the cost for one person to ride the go-karts twice is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for one person:**
   - The total cost for one person to play mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice is:
     \[
     5 \text{ (mini-golf)} + 5 \text{ (arcade tokens)} + 20 \text{ (go-karts)} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total budget:**
   - Morgan has a budget of $90.

5. **Number of people (including Morgan):**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite.
   - Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - The total cost for \( n + 1 \) people is \( 30 \times (n + 1) \).

6. **Setting up the equation:**
   - The total cost must not exceed the budget:
     \[
     30 \times (n + 1) \leq 90
     \]

7. **Solving the inequality:**
   - Divide both sides by 30:
     \[
     n + 1 \leq 3
     \]
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     n \leq 2
     \]

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets in total over 5 days from her parents:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops she buys each day:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops over 5 days:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the lollipops from the total amount of money she gets over 5 days to find out how much she saves:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs.
2. Calculate how much money he had left after buying the gumballs.
3. Determine how much money he initially spent on candy.
4. Calculate how many pounds of candy he bought.

**Step 1: Determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs.**

Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05. Therefore, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much money he had left after buying the gumballs.**

Billy initially had $10. After spending $2 on gumballs, he had:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Determine how much money he initially spent on candy.**

Billy took half of his remaining money and spent it on gumballs. Therefore, the $2 he spent on gumballs is half of his remaining money. This means he had $4 left before buying the gumballs. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate how many pounds of candy he bought.**

The candy costs $1.5 per pound. Therefore, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the number of people kicked out for each of the three specific reasons:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Adding these together gives us the total number of people kicked out for these three reasons:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Since Sara has 8 points, three times Sara's points would be:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin now has 24 points. The problem states that Erin scored 14 points to reach this total. Therefore, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current total of 24 points:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames and the etching for all 44 seniors.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   \[
   44 \text{ seniors} \times \$20 \text{ per frame} = \$880
   \]

2. **Cost of etching:**
   The etching cost is 20% of the cost of each picture frame.
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4 \text{ per frame}
   \]
   \[
   44 \text{ seniors} \times \$4 = \$176
   \]

3. **Cost of pins:**
   2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5.
   \[
   2 \text{ seniors} \times \$5 = \$10
   \]

4. **Cost of cords:**
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 44 = 11 \text{ officers}
   \]
   Each officer receives a cord costing $12.
   \[
   11 \text{ officers} \times \$12 = \$132

"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold over the three days, we add the pairs sold each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[ 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the apples picked on Monday were all sold, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks (since 1 pair = 2 socks), and also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she washed is:
\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies, so the total number of cookies Rachel had before her brother ate some is:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Her brother then ate 44 cookies, so the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

The interest on the principal amount of $3,650 for five months is:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spends $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we need to determine how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Given that she sells 4 cups per hour, the time to sell 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can set up the problem using algebra. Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

However, half of the performers can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Finally, add the cost of the erasers and the pencils to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 66:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's cost with tickets: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\$6\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare the cost of the streaming services to the cost of the cable package:
- The cable package costs $60 per month.
- The cost of the streaming services after the discount is $24 per month.

The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. **Writing a song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Next, we calculate the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours (writing)} + 2 \text{ hours (recording)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (editing)} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards Erica gave away is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards} \]

The total number of cards she received is:
\[ 17 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we calculate the net change in the number of cards Erica has:

"First, let's calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner when it runs for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. For 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the daily energy consumption in kilowatts is:
\[ \frac{7200 \, \text{watts}}{1000} = 7.2 \, \text{kW} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ \frac{2700 \, \text{watts}}{1000} = 2.7 \, \text{kW} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kW} - 2.7 \, \text{kW} = 4.5 \, \text{kW} \]

Over 30 days, the total savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kW/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kW} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kW} \]"

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the total cost:**

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby will be \(\boxed{40}\) minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

1. **Number of employees in May**: 40
2. **Hourly wage**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

The weekly pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 40 employees, the total weekly pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming May has 4 weeks, the total pay for May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

1. **Number of employees at the start of June**: 40
2. **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired**: 
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 30 employees, the total weekly pay for all employees in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming June also has 4 weeks, the total pay for June is:
\[ 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars (May)} + 72000 \text{ dollars (June)} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ 168000 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the expenses:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total expenses = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the second pack of fireworks costs $800.

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. We calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that 99% of the candles do not explode, which implies that 1% of the candles do explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog. Since the problem does not specify any overlap or additional conditions, we assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are independent of the exploding condition. However, we need to find the intersection of these two events.

Given that the problem does not provide a specific overlap percentage, we can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are distributed across all types of candles, including those that explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:

\[ \text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtract 124 from both sides:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is \(\frac{1}{4}\) the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. 

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Stanley's comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb.

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats each carried away 5 cats:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 12 \]

Final answer:

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the sale price, so \( J = 22 + 6 = 28 \).

The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since both the original prices are the same, the difference is:
\[ J - T = 28 - 28 = 0 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. We know that each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian builds attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders. Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. The total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she built is \(3 \times 30 = 90\). The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(90 + 60 = 150\).

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny needs $100 to buy the ticket and he ends up with $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sells is 2/3 of \( x \), which is equal to 100 cards.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

2. **Additional Guests:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than the initial 36 guests.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the initial 36 guests.
   - Since 4 additional guests showed up, the caterer had to prepare an additional 4 hotdogs for these guests.

3. **Total Hotdogs Needed:**
   - The initial 36 guests would have 36 hotdogs.
   - The additional 4 guests would need 4 more hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is \(36 + 4 = 40\).

4. **Hotdogs Available:**
   - The caterer initially prepared 36 hotdogs.
   - The additional 4 hotdogs were prepared for the extra guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs available is \(36 + 4 = 40\).

5. **Hotdogs for Second Helpings:**
   - The initial 36 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, but only 36 hotdogs were prepared for them.
   - This means that the 36 guests who were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each will have 1 hotdog each.
   - The 4 additional guests will have 1 hotdog each.

6. **Second Hotdogs:**
   - Since the 36 guests who were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each only got 1, they need 18 more hotdogs (since 18 guests need a second hotdog).
   - The 4 additional guests also need a second hotdog, which means they need 4 more hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of second hotdogs needed is \(18 + 4 = 22\).

7. **Hotdogs Available for Second Helpings:**
   - The caterer had 40 hotdogs in total.
   - 36 hotdogs were used for the first helpings.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs left for second helpings is \(40 - 36 = 4\).

8. **Guests Without Second Hotdogs:**
   - 22 second hotdogs are needed.
   - Only 4 hotdogs are available.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(22 - 4 = 18\).

**Final Answer:**
18 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."
"First, we determine the weight of each piece of cake. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, we divide the total weight by the number of pieces:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they consume:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the pieces they ate from the total weight of the cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 15 \text{ ounces} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts.

Given that Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, we need to find out how much earlier she should leave to account for her longer travel time and the 9-minute head start Wayne needs:

\[ 16 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Initially, Marcus's house is at 40 degrees.

Over 3 hours of baking, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees each hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total cooling effect is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this cooling effect from the temperature after baking:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is:
\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

So, Rozanne can put out \(\boxed{2}\) trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new total points after his turn in Scrabble. Joey initially has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new total points after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points. 

Final answer: Joey is winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all sales is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Movie super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda together: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown regular price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

3. **Savings Calculation:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda.
   - $21 (super ticket cost) + $2 (savings) = $23

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - From the total cost without the super ticket: $15 + $x = $23

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - $15 + $x = $23
   - $x = $23 - $15
   - $x = $8

The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 65 \times 170
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
65 \times 170 = 65 \times (100 + 70) = (65 \times 100) + (65 \times 70) = 6500 + 4550 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. **Calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:**
   - For the first segment: \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\)
   - For the second segment: \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = \(120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}\)

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}\)

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she trades these 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies is also $2400. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the total value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (since she started with 8 and traded 3) and 2 rubies. The value of the remaining 5 sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies gives the total value of all her jewels:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. 

In 30 days, Marin will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Similarly, Nancy will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Together, they will eat:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ fairies} \]

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \text{ fairies} \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \text{ fairies} \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of puppies from both Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, we perform the division and multiplication:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate 60% of 10:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, Shondra has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $50.

\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. First, we calculate 10 percent of $10.00:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

After the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

- Initial shoes: 200
- Shoes added on Monday: 10
- Shoes added on Wednesday: 30
- Shoes added on Friday: 60
- Shoes removed on Saturday: 180

Total shoes added: 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes

So, the total number of shoes before removing any on Saturday is:
200 (initial) + 100 (added) = 300 shoes

After removing 180 shoes on Saturday, the number of shoes left is:
300 - 180 = 120 shoes

Final numerical answer:
120"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake \(\boxed{4}\) pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The problem states that the piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2, so three times the price of the pen is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Since the piece of paper costs $1 less than this amount, the cost of the piece of paper is:

\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper:

\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the amount of change Theo received, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

The number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet since the shark's length is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To break in the new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week to achieve this goal in three weeks.

First, calculate the total number of days he will walk:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"First, we need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount spent by the price per book:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Price per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books each of her 4 kids received. Since she gave an equal number of books to each child, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received 5 books. 

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is \( 20 \)."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of employees.
   - Each group has 200 employees.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees is \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - There are 3 groups, and each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
   - Add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(600 + 21 = 621\).

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, we calculate how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"First, we need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we need to find the combined weight of both pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay needed to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they had earned by 3 pm. Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal was to raise $200. To find out how much more they needed to earn, we subtract the amount they had already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

So, they needed to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. The problem states that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, we calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse in one day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

Next, we determine how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures of each country and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

First, we sum these temperatures:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
\[
\frac{-30}{3} = -10
\]

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car.
2. Determine how many days it will take to save that amount at a rate of $2 per day.

First, we find the remaining amount needed:
\[ \text{Cost of toy car} - \text{Current savings} = \$12 - \$4 = \$8 \]

Next, we calculate the number of days required to save $8 at a rate of $2 per day:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} \div \text{Daily savings} = \$8 \div \$2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to place on the tray is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much Sally spends in total, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she gets the second pack free. So, she only pays for 1 pack:

- Cost for 1 pack = \$4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the reduced price:

- Remaining cost after coupon = \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00.

Heather is buying 2 packs, which contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack):

- Total number of razors = \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

Finally, we calculate the cost per razor:

- Cost per razor = \(\frac{\$2.00}{8} = \$0.25\).

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

- \$0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is 25 cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, who is 60"" tall. This cheerleader will be at the top of the human pyramid.

Next, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 layers:

1. The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall.
2. The second layer has 3 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall.
3. The third layer has 2 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall.
4. The top layer has 1 cheerleader, who is 60"" tall.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer:

\[ 4 \times 64"" + 3 \times 64"" + 2 \times 64"" + 60"" \]

Calculating each term:

\[ 4 \times 64"" = 256"" \]
\[ 3 \times 64"" = 192"" \]
\[ 2 \times 64"" = 128"" \]

Adding these together with the height of the shortest cheerleader:

\[ 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"" \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{636""}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[ 53 \text{ feet} \]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela's current age is 38."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost for morning rides: $84
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can determine the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food. Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. So, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \(L = D + 7\)
2. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)
3. \(L + D + B = 43\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the second equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the third equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[\boxed{16}\]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, the amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[ \boxed{273} \]"

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can calculate the number of pairs needed as follows:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the snowshoes. Given that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40/\text{day} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost without the pass and the cost with the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, let's determine the number of cows in the zoo. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's determine the number of sheep on the farm. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo gives:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given about Rose's purchases. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of onions Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
\[ 12 = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
\[ 4 = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
To find the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought to find the total number of items she purchased:
\[ \text{Total number of items Sophia bought} = \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} + \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July up to July 19th: 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:

Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she runs 2 km, the total amount of water is:
\[ 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 2 \, \text{km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"First, let's determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which amount to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which amount to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars}\]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[\boxed{32}\]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this, we get \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the number of quarts each person can pick per hour to find the total:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour.
   - Assuming she uses this 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 288 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - Weekly consumption is:
     \[
     288 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2016 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - Cost per kWh is $1.50, so the weekly cost is:
     \[
     2016 \text{ kWh} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 3024 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

1. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - Adding this to her current daily consumption:
     \[
     12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
     \]
   - Daily consumption with the new device:
     \[
     14 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 336 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Weekly consumption with the new device:

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Next, we need to find out the rate for 5 people working together. Since one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, 5 people working together would paint the house 5 times faster. Therefore, 5 people would take \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) days to paint a whole house.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 48 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

To find the cost of the headphone set, we solve for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs.

Each CD costs $4. To find out how many CDs he could buy with $48, we divide the total amount by the cost of one CD:
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} \]
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]"

After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off, which is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) passengers.

After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

**Final Answer:**
66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of one monitor:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"First, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount.

Total amount = $50 + $10 = $60

Since the check is to be split evenly and you are paying the additional 20% tip, you will pay half of the total amount.

Amount you pay = $60 / 2 = $30

So, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left. Therefore, the amount he has now is:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{39}

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Define the daily savings:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \)

5. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, the daily savings in the second half is \( 2x \).

6. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

7. **Set up the equation for the total savings for the month:**
   Total savings for the month = Total savings in the first half + Total savings in the second half
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]

8. **Equate the total savings to the target:**
   Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125.
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

10. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
    The daily savings in the second half is \( 2x \).
    \[
    2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
    \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought.

1. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 3
   - Cost per apple: $1.50
   - Total cost for apples: \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \)

2. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 5
   - Cost per orange: $0.80
   - Total cost for oranges: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \)

3. **Peaches:**
   - Number of peaches: 6
   - Cost per peach: $0.75
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)

Next, we add up the total costs of all the fruits to find the overall total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave.

\[
\text{Change} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."

\[ \$16 - \$10 = \$6 \]

Therefore, Jairus will get \$6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles per day.

**Final Answer: 30 miles**"
"To solve this problem, let's break down Elise's actions step by step:

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it in full twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Re-writing everything means writing these 65 letters again.

4. **Calculating the total number of letters written:**
   - The total number of letters written is the sum of the letters written in each step.
   - This is \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(130\)."
"To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

Thus, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during his 3 months of being unwell and then add that to his final weight.

1. Calculate the total weight lost:
   - Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
   - Number of months = 3
   - Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

2. Calculate the initial weight:

Therefore, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
- Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
- Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
- Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00
\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450."

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. Since the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (because Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks and his recommended amount is 4 cups), Octavia drinks half of that, which is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups."

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle**: The initial angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Total Movement**: Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the total movement, which is \(32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is \(\boxed{82}\) degrees."

"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, the reading rate is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using this rate, the number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old, and we can write the equation:
  \[
  51 = 3(N + 7)
  \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[
51 = 3(N + 7)
\]
\[
51 = 3N + 21
\]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[
30 = 3N
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
N = 10

"First, we need to calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 from his lemonade stand. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. Since he started with $70 and spent $40 from Sunday to Wednesday, the remaining amount is:

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he can buy with $40 is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

3. **Cost of 4 broken vases**: $12 each, so \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[ 200 + 60 + 48 = 308 \]

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week:

- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, the number of roses he lacks each week to supply all the flower shops is:

65 (needed) - 40 (grown) = 25 roses

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we calculate the total number of roses Ford lacks in a month:

25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from her initial amount in the account.

First, we know that Katina removes $100 from her account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, the total number of months is:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money removed over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times \$100/\text{month} = \$2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount in the account:
\[ \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00.
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's determine the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many crayon muffins she can make. Since each muffin is made from 8 small pieces of crayon, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kate can make \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps given in the problem can be broken down as follows:

1. Take the starting value \( x \) and add half of it: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
2. Divide the result by 5: \( \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \).
3. Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12: \( \left( \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \right) \times (x - 12) \).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into the expression and simplify step by step.

1. Calculate \( x + \frac{x}{2} \):
   \[
   20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

2. Divide the result by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

3. Multiply the result by \( x - 12 \):
   \[
   6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when she sets it to 450. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) such that the oven will read 520 degrees but is actually 4% too hot. This means:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together.

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is equal to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies together:
- The total time is \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"First, we need to calculate the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is. There are 90 pairs in 180 contacts.

Thus, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

**Jill's Work:**

- Saturday: Twice as long as Jill, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

**Jill's Earnings:**
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

**John's Earnings:**
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between John and Jill:

\[ \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

So, John earned \$40 more than Jill."
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
\[1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\]

Now, calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned:
\[\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:
\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
- \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values for the additional distance and the speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate his total spending over the three days and subtract that from his original amount of $100.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, his spending on Tuesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. Therefore, his spending on Wednesday is:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   Adding up his spending over the three days, we get:
   \[
   8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Money Left:**
   Subtracting his total spending from his original amount of $100, we find:
   \[
   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- He sold lemonade for 4 hours.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

So, the total earnings for the first four hours are:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times \$0.50 = \$30. \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- He sold lemonade for 2 hours.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

So, the total earnings for the next two hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times \$0.60 = \$12. \]

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42. \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per washing, we divide the total cost by the total number of washings:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert the cost per washing from dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we know that 1 pump gives 60 washings. Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ cents per washing}}{60 \text{ washings per pump}} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ cents per pump} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents per pump} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \text{ cents} \]"

1. **Discount on the shirt:**
   - Original price of the shirt: $25
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \)

2. **Discount on the shorts:**
   - Original price of the shorts: $35
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \)

3. **Total cost after discounts:**
   - Total cost: \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \)

4. **Money left after the purchase:**
   - Joe's initial amount: $50
   - Total cost after discounts: $42.00
   - Money left: \( 50 - 42 = 8.00 \)

**Final numerical answer:**
Joe will have $8.00 left after the purchase."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan plans to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make the croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Cost per meter = $194
- Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
- Total cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
- Total cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
- Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Initial Funding and Duration:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.

2. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - For the first 5 months, the funding is $100,000.
   - For the remaining \(50 - 5 = 45\) months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - 50% more than $100,000 is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(5 \times 100,000 = 500,000\).
   - Cost for the remaining 45 months: \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\).

4. **Total Research Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the remaining 45 months
   - Total cost = \(500,000 + 6,750,000 = 7,250,000\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7,250,000}

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \]"

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the number of remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we account for the gum he chews on the way home and after dinner. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's:

\[
1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
\]

Adding the pieces chewed at school, on the way home, and after dinner, we get:

\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Before bed, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Subtracting the 7 pieces he gives to his sister from the 14 pieces he had left, we get:

\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed for the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week, we get:

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the height requirement for the roller coaster. Adam is 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height as follows:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The height requirement for the roller coaster is 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the required growth from feet to inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches. Since he grows 2 inches per year, we divide the required growth by his annual growth rate:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the cars. Since the company paid 30% of the price of each car, and each car cost $25,000, the cost per car to the company is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost to the company for these cars is:

\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total revenue is:

\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost to the company:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. Therefore, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, the amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, the price of a silver jewel is:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by summing their individual prices:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:

   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:**
   - Distance to be covered: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

**Final answer:**
5 hours"
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the classes:**
   Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

2. **Determine the maximum allowable cost per class:**
   The maximum allowable cost per class is $10.

3. **Calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend:**
   To find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit, we divide the total cost by the maximum allowable cost per class:
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of classes} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Maximum cost per class}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
   \]

4. **Determine how many classes he can miss:**
   If Manny can attend a maximum of 6 classes, then the number of classes he can miss is:
   \[
   \text{Number of classes he can miss} = \text{Total number of classes} - \text{Maximum number of classes he can attend} = 10 - 6 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Manny can miss \(\boxed{4}\) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10."
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ customers daily} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ \text{Jewel's weekly production} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ customers} \]
\[ \text{Julie's weekly production} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \text{ customers} \]

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for both:

\[ 350 + 700 = 1050 \text{ customers} \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

\[ \boxed{1050} \]"

   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay **$12.00** for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, so:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total cost of the truck:

Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

1. **Time to dig through soil:**
   - Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Time to dig through clay:**
   - Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so he digs \(4 \text{ feet/hour} \div 2 = 2 \text{ feet/hour}\) through clay.
   - He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Total time to dig the well:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost of pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Clara paid $398 on Tuesday.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of pomegranates Sheila bought on Wednesday.

Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the discounted price is:

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

So, James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

This $220 represents the money she received this week, which includes her wage minus any amount that was withheld. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage can be calculated by subtracting the $220 from her expected wage:

\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes (pork) + 30 minutes (rice) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80\) minutes = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans.
   - Total cooking time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can write the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
2S + G - S - G = 15
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this extra time to the initial 48 minutes:

\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted:

\[ 53 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, calculate the number of employees who are management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

1. **Flour:**
   - For one muffin: 5 tablespoons
   - For 16 muffins: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) tablespoons

2. **Sugar:**

Aaron's candy: 4 pounds

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, they decide to share the candy equally among the three of them. To find out how much candy each person would get, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people:

Total candy / Number of people = 12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"First, we calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A:
\[ 7 \text{ candies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per candy} = \$3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.75 \text{ per candy} = \$7.5 \]

Next, we add the costs together to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ \$3.5 + \$7.5 = \$11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ \$15 - \$11 = \$4 \]

Therefore, the change Adam received is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so she had 8 good days in the first 8 days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days were added here.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days were added here.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This adds 2 more good days (since the first and third days were good).

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the next 3 days: 2

Total good days = 8 (initial) + 2 (next 3 days) = 10

Since Christina had 12 good days in total over the 30 days, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 (total good days) - 10 (good days already counted) = 2

**Final Answer:**
2"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. Therefore, the bamboo needs to grow:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so there are now \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so there are now \(24 - 3 = 21\) dogs.
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 12 toys.
   - After the second purchase, he had enough for 24 dogs.
   - Since 3 dogs left, he no longer needs the toys for those 3 dogs, but he already had enough for them.

So, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he bought:
\[ 4 \text{ (initial toys)} + 8 \text{ (first purchase)} + 12 \text{ (second purchase)} = 24 \]

**Final Answer:**
24"
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Therefore, Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is:

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her earnings for 6 hours are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can determine the number of hash browns per potato by dividing the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:

\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

This means that each potato can produce 6 hash browns. Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns each potato can produce:

\[ \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Including Jack, the total number of people is 9. Since Jack is also an adult, his weight is also 80 kg. Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults gives:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \]"

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is given by:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( T \):
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:
\[ W = T + 7 \]
\[ W = 18.5 + 7 \]
\[ W = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 25.5 \) years.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25.5} \]"

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time needed for homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap.

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time for homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives the combined total number of coins they have after ten years:

Therefore, the total number of coins they have ten years after they started their savings is:

\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah's backyard = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = \( 120 + 15 = 135 \) fireworks.

**Final Answer:**
135"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 20 seats, the total number of drinks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

And the total number of snacks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \]

So, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8,800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

1. **Number of Females and Dumplings Eaten by Each:**
   - There are 6 females.
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

2. **Number of Males and Dumplings Eaten by Each:**
   - There are 8 males, including Larry.
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

3. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males.
   - Total dumplings = \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is the initial 3 hours plus the additional 6 hours:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

**Final Answer:**
9"
"First, let's determine the percentage of the river's water that is used for non-industrial purposes by the city.

1. The city uses 40% of the river's total water.
2. 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining 20% is used for non-industrial purposes.

To find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes by the city, we calculate 20% of the 40% that the city uses:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 40\% = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 0.20 \times 40 = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

**Chocolate Ice Cream:**
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

**Vanilla Ice Cream:**
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

**Total Production in 48 Hours:**
- For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

6 scoops"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. James paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds he picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, we compare the two costs to find out how much James saved:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:

"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories = calories from eggs + calories from cheese + calories from ham
- Total calories = \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

"First, calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Cost of one pencil = $0.50
- Number of pencils = 6
- Total cost of pencils = $0.50 × 6 = $3.00

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
- Cost of one eraser = $0.25
- Number of erasers = 8
- Total cost of erasers = $0.25 × 8 = $2.00

Now, add the total cost of pencils and erasers to find the overall cost:
- Total cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers
- Total cost = $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
- Amount paid = $10.00
- Change = Amount paid - Total cost
- Change = $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the change you would get is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews:

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot when her arms are down and when they are raised.

1. **When her arms are down:**
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute
   - Total taps per minute with arms down: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - Right foot: 200 taps per minute
   - Left foot: 200 taps per minute
   - Total taps per minute with arms raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute

Next, we need to determine the time spent in each state:
- Total dance time: 5 minutes
- Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
- Time with arms down: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes

Now, we calculate the total number of taps for each state and then sum them up.

1. **Taps with arms down:**
   - Total taps: \(550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}\)

2. **Taps with arms raised:**
   - Total taps: \(400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}\)

Finally, we add the taps from both states to get the combined total:

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Cost if the city fixes the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it is not fixed.
   - Therefore, the cost if the city fixes it is $450.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron will also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is \(120 + 75 = 195\) dollars.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole himself:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost if the city fixes it and the cost if Ron fixes it himself.
   - This is \(450 - 195 = 255\) dollars.

So, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: \( 170 - 20 = 150 \)

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: \( 23 - 13 = 10 \)

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three people together ate:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two people together ate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
25 \text{ minutes}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. The blue spools are the light blue and dark blue ones:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means 2000 people had voted by midday. Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Adding the number of people who had voted by midday and by 16:00, we get:

\[ 2000 + 2000 = 4000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ 5000 - 4000 = 1000 \]

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.

Adding these together, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the number of people who will share it, including Greg and his 3 siblings.

The total number of people is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Greg)} + 3 \text{ (siblings)} = 4 \text{ people} \]

The total amount of money is $20. To find out how much each person gets, we divide the total amount by the number of people:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each of them gets:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's sum up the weights:

- Math books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 math books)
- Science books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 science books)
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

Adding these together:

\[4 \text{ (math)} + 4 \text{ (science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 21 pounds."
"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the ice cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine the number of books Steven has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven:
\[ 2S = 20 \]
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so the difference is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play music**: Twice the number that like to play basketball, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25

"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. 

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. Now, subtract the scared birds from the initial number:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the 8 remaining birds. Add these 20 birds to the 8 that were left:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of birds now in the backyard is:
\[ 28 \]"
"Since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same amount of students, we can determine the number of students in each class by dividing 80 by 2:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in each class as follows:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the total number of slices now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so the final number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of grooming jobs Melissa has for the week. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal grooming job:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total grooming jobs = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of old magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards he received. He received one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. Additionally, there are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. The total value of these 30 cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the values of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each and now buys them for $0.40 each. The difference in price per tomato is:

\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:

\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the vendor saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:

\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have based on the relationships provided.

First, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, if Sean has 56 marbles, Cal has:
\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, Carl has:
\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \text{ marbles} \]

To find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles each has:
\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

3. **Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them, so she has 20 large stickers left.
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons: 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to small buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total buttons = \(27 + 60 + 60 = 147\).

Therefore, by the end, Lorraine has \(\boxed{147}\) buttons."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

"First, calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the race. This is 20% of 50 people:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. This is 60% of the remaining 40 people:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, determine how many people think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x \) with \( \frac{500}{7} \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:
\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{\frac{1000}{7}}\) cases of shingles."

Given:
- Number of bananas = 200
- Percentage more pears than bananas = 45%

Calculate 45% of 200:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = \frac{45}{100} \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, the number of pears George has is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is:
\[ \boxed{490} \]"

"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- Her hourly rate is $15, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- For 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Adding her earnings from both days:

- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her activities over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both Ava and Emma.

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E = 215 \]

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in these 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on these days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
Thus, for the two days, the number of rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days together, the total number of rides in a week is:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \) on one side, we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Isolate \( W \):

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the 8 hours she works each day at her regular hourly rate of $20 per hour.

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Since Jamie worked 11 hours on Tuesday, she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8-hour workday. The special hourly rate for these additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

To find the special hourly rate:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the additional pay to find the total amount Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday:

\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions as female lions, which means there are \(12 \div 2 = 6\) male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

3. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees after three months:**
   - Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
   - Total salary for one month for all employees: \( 260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000 \) dollars.
   - Since we are calculating for three months, the total salary over three months is \( 1,040,000 \times 3 = 3,120,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$3,120,000**."
"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing both songs based on the given durations and frequencies.

1. Calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
   - ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, and each time it takes 150 seconds.
   - Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 2 × 150 seconds = 300 seconds.

2. Calculate the total time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
   - ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and it takes 240 seconds.
   - Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 1 × 240 seconds = 240 seconds.

3. Add the total times for both songs to get the overall caroling time:
   - Total caroling time = 300 seconds (for ""Deck the Halls"") + 240 seconds (for ""Jingle Bells"") = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds."
"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage of his employment:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230 \]

Next, we determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[ \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210 \]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally:
\[ \$230 - \$210 = \$20 \]

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have 14 days. Therefore, the total hours for the first part are:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which has 7 days. Therefore, the total hours for the second part are:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts to find the total hours Kris has played so far:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:

\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"First, we calculate the total cost of the materials without the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade and then find the overall pass rate for the school.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340
   - Total number of third-graders: 500
   - Pass rate for third-graders: \(\frac{340}{500} = 0.68\) or 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40
   - Total number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Pass rate for fourth-graders: \(\frac{40}{100} = 0.40\) or 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the fourth-graders' pass rate.
   - Fourth-graders' pass rate: 0.40

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by the product of its height and length:
\[ \text{Area} = 3 \times L \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3 \times L = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[48 \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Dale initially planned to sell 100 butterscotch candies. He ended up selling 150 candies and then ordered 100 more. 

First, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has after ordering more:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 250 \text{ candies} \]

Dale originally had 100 candies, but he sold 150, which means he sold 50 more than he initially had:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} - 100 \text{ (initially had)} = 50 \text{ extra sold} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candies he still needs to sell to sell all 250 candies:
\[ 250 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (already sold)} = 100 \text{ candies} \]

So, Dale still needs to sell:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Subtract the petals dropped from the initial total:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows to make the S'mores. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After accounting for the marshmallows used and dropped, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
3. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Two friends: 10 minutes each
- Better friend: 30 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time they can play in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack can play \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) times.
- Each of the two friends can play \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) times.
- The better friend can play \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) times.

Adding these up gives the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(2 \times 24 = 48\) quarters
- Better friend: 8 quarters

The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

Therefore, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\) quarters."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, and it fills a 10-ounce jar:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so the cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

He also buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so the cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Adding the cost of the goats and the cows together gives:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[ 4500 \]"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to:

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised in total. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time Sandy walked over the two days in hours, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total number of cars:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

By the lunch break, half of the cars had left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35 \]

Subtracting these 35 cars from the total number of cars before lunch gives the number of cars present during lunch:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is:

\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Since each cycle consists of 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20, the payment for one cycle is:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, the daily earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

\[ 7 \text{ days} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.

In the second game, which was played at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

**Total points Sasha scored during both games:**
18"

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. So, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

The total number of eggs is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total cost of the book and the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 32 + 3.00 = 35.00 \]
\[ \text{Money lost} = 35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gave her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has before buying anything is:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. The total cost of the bag is:

\[ 20 \]

Now, we add the cost of the jeans and the bag to find the total amount spent:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount of money she had initially:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find out the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate for the month. The total monthly production is 50,000 bars.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is:
\[
\boxed{14,000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then multiply by four to find the monthly total.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Next, we sum up the weekly time spent on all activities:
- Total time spent per week = \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
- Total time spent per month = \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
1128 minutes."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs additional items: 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. We need to calculate the cost for the additional items:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:

$129.00 (base installation) + $30.00 (additional mirrors) + $15.00 (additional chandelier) + $150.00 (additional pictures) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

**Final Answer:**
Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

First, he travels for 4 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 3 \times 18 \]

Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

We need to find the time \(t\) it takes for four turtles to cross the same distance \(D\). The distance \(D\) is the same, so:
\[ D = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t \]
\[ 54v = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t \]
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]
\[ 54 = 2t \]
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the price after the trade-in is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop after receiving help from her mom and her part-time job earnings. This means the total amount of money she currently has, plus the $50 she still needs, should equal the price of the laptop after the trade-in. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 280 = 400 \]

To find the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we subtract 280 from 400:

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 400 - 280 = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

**15**"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \( 16 \) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Given:
- Total number of students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. This can be found by subtracting the number of students good at math only and those good at English only from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - 13 \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

1. **Time per group:**
   - Getting on stage: 2 minutes
   - Performing: 6 minutes
   - Exiting the stage: 2 minutes
   - Total time per group: \(2 + 6 + 2 = 10\) minutes

2. **Total concert time:**
   - The show is 2 hours long.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes

3. **Intermission:**
   - There is a 10-minute intermission.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the principal amount.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   However, this interpretation seems incorrect because an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical. Instead, it should be interpreted as 75% of the original amount per year, which is:
   \[
   r = 0.75 \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   Correcting the interpretation, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for one year:**
   \[
   I = P \times r = 300 \times 0.75 = 225
   \]

4. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = I \times \text{number of years} = 225 \times 3 = 675
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of white shirts without collars:**
   - The total number of white shirts is 40.
   - The number of white shirts with collars is 20.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

4. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts without collars is 20.

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Adding the remaining goats in both farms together, we get:

"First, calculate the total cost for the baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for the baskets of red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- Therefore, the total cost for red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the total costs for the green and red food to find the overall total:
- Total cost for green food: $75.
- Total cost for red food: $48.
- Therefore, the total amount to be paid is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person in question (you).

From the problem, we can derive the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \) using the second relationship:
\[ S = A - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( A = B - 3 \) into the expression for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, we substitute \( A = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the equation for the mother's age:
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

We now have all the ages in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 3 \]
\[ S = B - 5 \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

Substitute these into the sum of their ages:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find your age \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
\[ 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} \times 3 \text{ daughters} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. Since there are 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos consumed is:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars, and then subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars in the rink.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
75 - 52 = 23

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, the carrots weigh:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, we calculate:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, the remaining amount that Keenan pays is:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first day.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces he ate over the three days:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far."
"First, let's determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Given that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, the cost of one bottle of soda is:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Given that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, the cost of one bottle of water is:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 + 2 \times 2.00 = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.**

Each bolt costs $0.03. Therefore, the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.**

David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, the final amount of money David has left is:

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens plus the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he took to the market is:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, we can find the combined sales of Micah and Mitchell by subtracting Julie's sales from the total:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many each of them sold:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and we assume she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters).

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope.

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be thrice her current age:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age.
   - Her age in \(x\) years will be \(8 + x\).
   - We need this to be equal to three times her current age, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

3. **Formulate and solve the equation:**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 24 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 16

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly is buying.

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon for a total of $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is $5."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. Jerry also counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate \(3 \times 8\):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

These 50 cookies were then placed equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Joe paid her $6 for each mowing session.

First, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn:
\[ \text{Earnings from Joe's lawn} = 6x \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
\[ \text{Earnings from Kamala's lawn} = 6 \times 3x = 18x \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Alba's lawn} = 6 \times 5x = 30x \]

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the earnings from each lawn:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month were $80. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Therefore:
\[ 54x + L = 80 \]

To find \( x \), we need to determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns. Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54x \), and we know the total earnings were $80, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ 54x = 80 - L \]

However, we need to find \( L \) directly. We can rearrange the equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 80 - 54x \]

Since \( 54x \) is the total earnings from mowing lawns, and we know the total earnings were $80, we can find \( L \) by subtracting \( 54x \) from 80. We need to find \( x \) first. Since \( 54x \) must be a multiple of 6 (as each mowing session pays $6), and the only feasible value for \( x \) that keeps \( 54x \) within the range of $80 is when \( x = 1 \):
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting out his car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car each month is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of notebooks Martha had:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the original number of notebooks Martha had:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Number of notebooks Joseph had} = 3 \times \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the adults. The two children will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the children. In total, they will consume 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls of soup.

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and they will consume 4 bowls, there will be no soup left over. Therefore, each child will be able to have 0 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Final answer:
0"
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost for the ballpen is:

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
  \[
  \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20:
  \[
  \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, we calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
  \[
  \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8:
  \[
  \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks to get the total material required:
\[
\text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, Jo would need \boxed{16} yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and she has seen each one 3 times, the total number of tickets is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that Deepa spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes. After using 3, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes. The number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Initially, Tim has 9 red shoe boxes. After using 3, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box are 4 and 6, respectively. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Dean originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 16 marbles, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, the number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm size = 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm = 2 * 200 acres = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm size = 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm size + Farmer Smith's farm size
Total acres = 200 acres + 500 acres
Total acres = 700 acres.

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( r \) and \( y \):
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We also know that \( r = 20 \). Substituting \( r \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( y = 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles required for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\[5 + 10 + 8 = 23\]

Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball.

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two activities:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:
\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21

"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
\]

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \).

Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + x = 9
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[
2x = 9
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make is:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries picked per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days if it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person initially received:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
- Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons:

- Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Now, let's add up all the balloons:

- Initial balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15

Total number of balloons = \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \]

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets.

**Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
- Price per widget: $6
- Total widgets: 43,200

Total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{\$/widget} = 259,200 \, \text{\$} \]

**Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Price per widget: $6
- Total widgets: 32,400

Total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{\$/widget} = 194,400 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

Difference in revenue:
\[ 259,200 \, \text{\$} - 194,400 \, \text{\$} = 64,800 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under the two different options:

1. **24-hour stay option:**
   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

2. **12-hour stay plus additional hours option:**
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - The remaining hours are 17 - 12 = 5 hours.
   - The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.
   - Therefore, the cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
   - The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we compare the two options:
- 24-hour stay option: 1600 pesos
- 12-hour stay plus additional hours option: 1350 pesos

The difference in cost between the two options is:
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour stay plus additional hours option.

**Final Answer:**
250"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. Therefore, the number of children in one school is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).

Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children is:
\[56 \times 5 = 280\]

So, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 205
\]

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\$110} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. **Yams:**

   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Quantity: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Quantity: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn **$34**."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\).
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\).

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so:

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales:

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- He gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

So, the total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

So, the total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:

\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley earns is:
\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo’s age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus’s age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (since the total points scored by the team is 45)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of thickness.

Since each inch of the book contains 100 pages (50 pages on each side of the paper), we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"First, let's calculate the usual sleeping hours for Kim. She goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. The usual sleeping duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.

Next, we convert 8 hours into minutes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so her wake-up time on this day was:
\[ 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \]

Now, we calculate the time Kim was asleep from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.:
- From 10 p.m. to midnight (12 a.m.) is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
- From midnight to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 355 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these two periods together gives the total time Kim was asleep:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 355 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes} \]

However, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.:
- The time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

So, the time Kim was actually asleep on that day is:
\[ 475 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ \boxed{452} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 

First, calculate the number of occupied beds initially:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Next, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Adding these new admissions to the initial unoccupied beds:
\[ 800 + 700 = 1500 \text{ beds} \]

However, the hospital's total capacity is only 1000 beds. Therefore, the maximum number of unoccupied beds the hospital can have is 0, as it will be fully occupied after the 1000th bed is filled.

Thus, after 2 weeks, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people as 100% and the number Courtney reported as 120% of the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney reported 48 people, which is 120% of the actual number. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of balls each boy carried and then sum them up to find the total number of balls.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes

   Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Account for the holes filled in:**
   - Holes filled in: 2 holes

   Total holes remaining after filling in:
   \[
   31 - 2 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.

   Holes at the end of the first day:
   \[
   10 \text{ holes}
   \]

   Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Holes by the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Holes remaining after the third day: 29 holes

   Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) in terms of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \( 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles} \)
- Total distance flown north: \( 36 \, \text{miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[ 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles} \]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies. This is equivalent to 6 brownies (since 1/2 dozen = 12/2 = 6).
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. This is 48 brownies (since 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48).
4. Adding all the brownies together, before any were eaten, Greta had:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]
5. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. This is equivalent to 18 brownies (since 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18).
6. Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total, the number of brownies left is:
   \[
   66 - 18 = 48
   \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, the brother's age is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. She is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ years} \]
So, the sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (one for himself, one for his wife, and one for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is $300 each. So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the costs together, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ 33 \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes she bought:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and then sold a portion of. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the remaining 3/4 were sold. First, we calculate the total number of oranges in the 8 boxes she kept:

\[ 8 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 160 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find out how many oranges she kept (1/4 of 160):

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges} \]

The rest of the oranges were sold, so we subtract the oranges she kept from the total oranges she had:

\[ 160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

\[ 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we know the total number of cherries shared by Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of product on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's break down the sales for each day:

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: Since it's 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, using the number of boxes sold on Sunday, we can find out the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday:
- Apple pie on Saturday: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
- Apple pie earnings: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
- Total earnings for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
- Apple pie earnings: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
- Total earnings for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to get the total earnings:
- Total earnings for two days: \(\$225 + \$315 = \$540\)

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of \(\$540\) for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the amount of sunscreen used per day is \( 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{ounces} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:**
   - She will be outside for 8 days.
   - The total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days is \( 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \).

3. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - The number of bottles required is \( \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \).

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract that from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
     - Let the age of Emil's dad at that time be \(D\).
     - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
     - Let the age of Emil's brother at that time be \(B\).
     - Therefore, \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

3. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.
   - Similarly, his brother will be \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:

"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

Now, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes each month, which is the amount she sets aside.

\[ \text{Amount spent on shoes each month} = \$500.00 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes she can buy each month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs each month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pairs in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since the peeling and sautering are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = time to peel + time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To determine the final temperature of the room, we need to calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner and the warming effect of the room's natural temperature increase.

1. **Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours.
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling effect: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours.
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling effect: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming:**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming effect: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Cooling Effect:**
   - Total cooling effect (low + high): \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net cooling effect after accounting for warming: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - If Bill's dad was \( D \) years old when he saw the comet, and 75 years have passed since then, Bill's age at the second sighting is \( D + 75 \).
   - We know that Bill's age at the second sighting is also \( 3D \).

5. **Solve for \( D \):**
   \[
   D + 75 = 3D
   \]
   \[
   75 = 3D - D
   \]
   \[
   75 = 2D
   \]
   \[
   D = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5
   \]

6. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet.
   - Since 75 years have passed between the two sightings, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is:
   \[
   37.5 - 75 = -37.5
   \]
   This result is not possible because age cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and the interpretation of the ages.

Given the problem's context, it's more likely that the ages are whole numbers. Let's re-evaluate with the assumption that the ages are whole numbers and recheck the logical steps.

If Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times 30, which is 90 years old, then:
- The time between the two sightings is 75 years.
- Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time would be:
\[
90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of:
\[
52 \text{ checks per year}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls. The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts for 60 seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \text{ seconds (Chikote)} + 60 \text{ seconds (Igneous)} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's new trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The total amount collected is:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

However, the problem also mentions that Walter's friend will give him an additional $200. This amount is not part of the lawyer's contribution but rather a separate donation. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution remains:

\[ 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio of the slices each adult and each kid gets and then convert that into a percentage of the whole watermelon.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). Therefore, the total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the total \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for his 10 appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes, so:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for all the steps and then work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time.

1. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes

3. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Total time required:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, subtract the total time required from the serving time (5:00 pm):
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is at 2:00 pm."

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
   - Total cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Daily earnings = Total cost per session * Number of sessions per day
   - Daily earnings = $40 * 3 = $120

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has 4 weeks, and the studio is open 3 days a week, the number of days in a month = 4 * 3 = 12 days
   - Monthly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a month
   - Monthly earnings = $120 * 12 = $1440

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1440."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64.
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56.

From the information provided, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ G = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ C = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

The final cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank had 28% of its charge remaining.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{(0.93)^3}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348

   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   Solving for \( y \):

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{(0.91)^5}
   \]

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
   \]

   So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%.

**Final Answer:**
The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. We calculate 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2000}{\$1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Anne gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends equally, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received:

\[ 78 \text{ pieces} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound growth:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price of carrots is $120, the growth rate is 5% (or 0.05), and the number of years is 3.

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums are exclusively selfies and 2 albums are exclusively portraits. This means the total number of pictures in these albums is:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} + 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

Final answer:

Therefore, Aries is sure to get \(\boxed{36}\) points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \). Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the amount of ore mined with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe.

4. The amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month is \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds.
5. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(1080 \times 40 = 43200\) pounds of ore in a month.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 100% - 40% = 60% or 0.60
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 0.60 = 0.30\) or 30%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment: 20% or 0.20

"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college:

\[ \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \, \text{USD/year} \times 4 \, \text{years} = 200,000 \, \text{USD} \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After college, his income is tripled, so his new income is:

\[ \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 \, \text{USD/year} = 75,000 \, \text{USD/year} \]

During the 4 years of college, Jim did not work, so he lost the opportunity to earn $25,000 per year. The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is:

\[ \text{Lost income} = 25,000 \, \text{USD/year} \times 4 \, \text{years} = 100,000 \, \text{USD} \]

Now, we need to find out the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income:

\[ \text{Total amount to earn} = 200,000 \, \text{USD} + 100,000 \, \text{USD} = 300,000 \, \text{USD} \]

Since Jim's new income after college is $75,000 per year, we can calculate the number of years it will take him to earn $300,000:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{300,000 \, \text{USD}}{75,000 \, \text{USD/year}} = 4 \, \text{years} \]

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Amount won in the second race = \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
  \[
  5 + 16.5 = 21.5
  \]

- Total amount won = Amount won in the second race
  \[
  11
  \]

- Net amount lost = Total amount lost - Total amount won
  \[
  21.5 - 11 = 10.5
  \]

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the net amount lost by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
3.5

1. Determine the number of cities in South America: There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).
2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the heights are given in inches and the growth is also in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - Each painter worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by all painters in one day:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours each day.
   - Since there are 4 painters, the total hours worked by all painters in one day is \(4 \times 9 = 36\) hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by all painters over 21 days:**
   - The total hours worked by all painters over 21 days is \(36 \times 21 = 756\) hours.

5. **Calculate the hours worked by each painter:**
   - Since there are 4 painters, the hours worked by each painter is \(\frac{756}{4} = 189\) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in \(\boxed{189}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the concept of exponential decay. The formula for exponential decay is:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the value of the car at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial value of the car,
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 21\% = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
\[ 120 + 20 = 140 \]

At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
\[ 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
\[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: The shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Tennis shoes**: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Athletic socks**: The package originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 off coupon, so:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is **$2400**."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of sheets Greg uses in a year for each type of bed.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year:
- Twin sheets used in a year: \(4 \text{ beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- King sheets used in a year: \(1 \text{ bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to calculate the number of loads of laundry required for each type of sheet, given the machine's capacity:
- The machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is: \(\frac{208 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ sheets per load}} = 104 \text{ loads}\)
- The machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is: \(\frac{52 \text{ king sheets}}{1 \text{ sheet per load}} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding the loads for both types of sheets gives the total number of loads of laundry in a year:
\[104 \text{ loads (twin)} + 52 \text{ loads (king)} = 156 \text{ loads}\]

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. **Becky's Slices:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.

2. **Jake's Slices:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

3. **Silvia's Slices:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Next, we sum the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia to find the total number of slices eaten.

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices}
\]

\[

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we solve for \( D \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost per pill is $4, and she needs 30 pills. Therefore, the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the total cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's determine how many pizzas the football team ordered and how many they ate.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. According to the problem, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney now has is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost step by step:

1. **Determine the cost without the promotion:**
   - Cost per pound of butter = $4.00
   - Total pounds needed = 6
   - Total cost without promotion = 6 pounds * $4.00/pound = $24.00

2. **Apply the promotion:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - This means for every 1.5 pounds of butter, he only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per 1.5 pounds:**
   - Cost for 1 pound = $4.00
   - Cost for 0.5 pound (half off) = $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00
   - Total cost for 1.5 pounds = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

4. **Determine how many 1.5 pound units are in 6 pounds:**
   - Number of 1.5 pound units in 6 pounds = 6 pounds / 1.5 pounds/unit = 4 units

5. **Calculate the total cost with the promotion:**
   - Total cost with promotion = 4 units * $6.00/unit = $24.00

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $24.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left, we can set up the equation to find the original amount of money Maggie had:
\[ \text{Original amount of Maggie's money} - \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Original amount of Maggie's money} = 60 \]
Let \( M \) be the original amount of Maggie's money. Then:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ M = 80 \]

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, since Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left, we can set up the equation to find the original amount of money Riza had:
\[ \text{Original amount of Riza's money} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Original amount of Riza's money} = 60 \]
Let \( R \) be the original amount of Riza's money. Then:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ R = 90 \]

So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:
- Maggie has $60 left.
- Riza has $60 left.

Adding the amounts of money they have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas:
\[ 315 - (24 \times 7) = 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas for the week} \]

Now, to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle and then finished another entire 500 piece puzzle.

Half of a 500 piece puzzle is:
\[ \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Teddy placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

The total number of pieces Teddy placed is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the roses cost $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy 15 roses at the per-rose price. Therefore, she should buy a dozen roses at the discounted price of $15 and then buy the remaining 3 roses at $2 each.

The cost for a dozen roses is:
\[ \$15 \]

The cost for 3 roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$6 \]

So, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ \$15 + \$6 = \$21 \]

Jenny has $25, and the total cost is $21, so the change she should receive is:
\[ \$25 - \$21 = \$4 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in $1, so in $4 there are:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   - Number of milkshakes: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum up the totals from each item:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul arrives (which is when the first train arrives) and the time his train (the fourth train) arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20 = 30).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 35 minutes after the first train arrives (10 + 30 + 5 = 45).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs 60 minutes after the first train arrives (10 + 30 + 35 + 60 = 135).

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs.
   - Departs 155 minutes after the first train arrives (135 + 20 = 155).

Paul will wait from the time the first train arrives (10 minutes) until the fourth train arrives (155 minutes). Therefore, the total waiting time is:

\[ 155 - 10 = 145 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes."
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Original price} - \text{Price paid by friend}}{\text{Original price}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{2000 - 1800}{2000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is **72000**."
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Since Binkie's score was 90, we can calculate Frankie's score as follows:

1. Twice Binkie's score: \(2 \times 90 = 180\)
2. 15 more than twice Binkie's score: \(180 + 15 = 195\)

Therefore, Frankie's score was 195.

Frankie's score: 195"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).
3. **Realization and return**: James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. **Total distance walked**: James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, totaling \( 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ miles} \).
5. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

**Final Answer:**
1 hour"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year.

Given:
- The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.

First, calculate the annual growth rate:
\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, to find the growth over 13 years, multiply the annual growth rate by 13:
\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"First, let's calculate the number of bales the farmer makes in a 6-hour day:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the farmer makes \(5 \times 6 = 30\) bales.

Next, let's calculate the number of bales the truck picks up in a 6-hour day:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the truck picks up \(3 \times 6 = 18\) bales.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field after the truck has picked up its share:
- The number of bales left in the field is the number of bales made by the farmer minus the number of bales picked up by the truck.
- Therefore, the number of bales left is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
12"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

1. **First Child:**
   - Height: 6 feet
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

2. **Second Child:**
   - Height: 2 inches taller than the first child
   - Height: \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \)

3. **Third Child:**
   - Height: 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - Height: \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - Height: 3 inches taller than the third child
   - Height: \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \( 72 \) inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops initially had 1080 kilograms of meat.

1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each pair of walls.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one wall is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one wall is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial conditions:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda. We need to find the probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken.

The total number of sodas left is:
2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8

The probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours.

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours.

\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to determine how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so we calculate 20% of 50 days:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

This means Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Therefore, over 40 days, he helps:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the initial balance after Sheila returned the item that cost $15.00. 

Initial charge: $85.00

Balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00.

Discount on frying pan: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Cost of frying pan after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, we calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00.

Discount on towels: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Cost of towels after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the balance after the return.

Total additional charges: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance on the credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we determine Ben's age. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, we calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate Caroline's age. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, and Ben is 8 years old, we calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to divide it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. 

The final answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ centimeters} \]"
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount of apples left for Jacques (James) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, James will have:
\[ \boxed{5} \text{ kg} \]"
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since the 2 books cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

1. Calculate 20% of 50 students:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

2. Add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks and then use that rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, we calculate the rate of blinking:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
- The rate of blinking is \( \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \).

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
- If the light blinks 51 times per minute, then to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51.
- \( \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Total male fishes initially:
\[ 4 \text{ (male guppies)} + 3 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 7 \]

Total female fishes initially:
\[ 7 \text{ (female guppies)} + 5 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 12 \]

Next, let's account for the new fishes Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Total male fishes after purchase:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial male fishes)} + 2 \text{ (new male guppies)} + 2 \text{ (new male goldfishes)} = 11 \]

Total female fishes after purchase:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial female fishes)} + 1 \text{ (new female guppies)} + 3 \text{ (new female goldfishes)} = 16 \]

Now, we need to find how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:
\[ 16 \text{ (total female fishes)} - 11 \text{ (total male fishes)} = 5 \]

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\) hours."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for two visits a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance per month = 2 × Round trip distance
   - Total distance per month = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order, which will help us find the production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production of these four workers per hour:
- The total production of the first two workers is 12 toys per hour.
- The total production of the next two workers is 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, the total production of these four workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since all five workers work for 10 hours, the total production of these four workers over 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means the four workers have produced:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find the production rate of the fifth worker per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.
2. **Kris had 16 stickers, which is half of what Luis gave her.** Therefore, Luis gave Kris \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. **Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth and gave the rest to Kris.** This means the 32 stickers Luis gave to Kris were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth originally had **64 stickers**."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, if John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can find out how many small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
     \[
     120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
     \[
     600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph}
     \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, Vince's age two years ago was \(14 \div 2 = 7\) years old. 

So, Vince is now \(7 + 2 = 9\) years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the expression for \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \(C\):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted \(\boxed{8}\) more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood.

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes from selling all the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's earnings:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount Jane has saved over the past 8 weeks. Since she saves $4 each week, we multiply $4 by 8 weeks:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

So, Jane has saved $32 so far. To find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60, we subtract the amount she has already saved from $60:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks she needs to save:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of blue birds in the first 3 trees:**
   - Each of these 3 trees has 7 blue birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue birds in these 3 trees is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

2. **Calculate the number of blue birds in the next 2 trees:**
   - Each of these 2 trees has 4 blue birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue birds in these 2 trees is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Calculate the number of blue birds in the final tree:**
   - This tree has 3 blue birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue birds in this tree is \(3\).

4. **Sum the blue birds from all the trees:**
   - The total number of blue birds is \(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\).

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is **32**."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, the equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has is:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces + 1 ounce).

The formula for the weighted average temperature \( T_{\text{avg}} \) is:
\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in three weeks:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

6. **Total chickens added in three weeks:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

7. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

\[ 10\% \times \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, 18 scoops will require: 
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans. Since there are 17 green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jelly beans is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree. 

First, calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, calculate the number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years):
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[ 300 \text{ lemons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet is sold for $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
     \]
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291 \text{ sunflowers}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue:

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket
The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners
The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So for the weekend, he eats:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend gives:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce 5 bottles (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of these are wearing bows. According to the problem:

- All 2 blue-wearers are wearing bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers are wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) octuplets.

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Out of these 4 octuplets wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple and 2 are wearing blue. Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple-wearing bow wearers divided by the total number of bow wearers:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( 50\% \)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

First, let's add up the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1907 reports
- Thursday and Friday: 2136 reports

Total for these days: \(1907 + 2136 = 4043\) reports

Now, subtract this total from the overall total of reports received last week:
- Total reports received last week: 5168 reports

Reports received on Wednesday: \(5168 - 4043 = 1125\)

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

He sold this land for $50. After this sale, the remaining land is:

\[
80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his remaining land. The amount of land sold in this transaction is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ square meters}
\]

He sold this land for $30. After this sale, the remaining land is:

\[
40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters}
\]

Abraham then sold the remaining 30 square meters of land for $3 per square meter. The money earned from this sale is:

\[
30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add up all the money earned from the three sales:

\]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is calculated as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs each person found:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, we sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the fruit production for each year and then sum these values.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. First, we need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces.
5. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
6. **9-year-old tree**: Does not produce any fruits.
7. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2450}\)."

To find 1/5 of $100:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we need to add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides to isolate the term with \( Y \):
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( \boxed{20} \) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is:
\[ \boxed{93} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ \text{Additional pods} = 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills remaining is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]

This means the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills of $20 each, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half:

- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

Next, we calculate the number of goals scored by each team in the second half:

- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
- Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, we sum up the goals for each team over the entire match:

- Total goals for Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
- Total goals for Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- Initial remaining chalk \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
- Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

The remaining chalk after each day can be calculated as:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n - 0.2 \times C_n = 0.8 \times C_n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk for each day:

- Day 1: \( C_1 = 0.8 \times 2.75 = 2.2 \) inches.
- Day 2: \( C_2 = 0.8 \times 2.2 = 1.76 \) inches.

Since \( C_2 = 1.76 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk by the end of the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[
12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Final numerical answer:
\[
17

**Final Answer:**
Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we add the number of teeth drilled and capped to find the total number of teeth fixed:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

The amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

The refund amount is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of books he can buy with $27000.

The number of books he can buy with $27000 is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the money is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
\]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up these two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - He put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - He threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton threw the apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples.

Now, let's count the apples Newton has in his pocket after each action:

- Initially, Newton has 2 apples.
- After putting one in his pocket, he has 1 apple in his hand.
- After picking up 5 more apples, he has 1 + 5 = 6 apples in his hand.
- After putting 4 apples in his pocket, he has 1 apple in his hand.
- After picking up 6 more apples, he has 1 + 6 = 7 apples in his hand.

Adding the apples in his pocket and the one in his hand:

- Apples in his pocket: 1 (from the first action) + 4 (from the second action) = 5 apples.
- Apples in his hand: 7 apples.

Total apples Newton brought home:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

And since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

First, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
- Sam ran 3 miles each day on these three days.
- So, for these three days, the total miles are \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday:
- Sam ran 5 miles each day on these two days.
- So, for these two days, the total miles are \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to get the total miles Sam ran this week:
- Total miles = miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday + miles on Tuesday and Thursday
- Total miles = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
19 miles."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes).

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In 1 hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which means \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt in 1 hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs but loses 8 snowballs due to melting.
   - Net rate of snowball accumulation = \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs per hour.

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to have 60 snowballs, we use the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour.
   - Time required = \( \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it has been 20 years since it first came out.

2. **Calculate Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
   - At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old 20 years ago.

3. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since Jim was 4 years old, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by each:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of bandages used and ordered each day, and then determine the initial number of bandages.

**Day 1:**
- Bandages used: 38
- Bandages ordered: 50
- Total bandages at the end of Day 1: \(38 + 50 = 88\)

**Day 2:**
- Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
- Total bandages at the end of Day 2: \(88 - 28 = 60\)

**Day 3:**
- Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
- Bandages used: Half a pack = \(50 / 2 = 25\)
- Total bandages at the end of Day 3: \(60 - 25 + 100 = 135\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match this condition.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

**Day 1:**
- Bandages used: 38
- Bandages ordered: 50
- Total bandages at the end of Day 1: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)

**Day 2:**
- Bandages used: 28
- Total bandages at the end of Day 2: \(x + 12 - 28 = x - 16\)

**Day 3:**
- Bandages ordered: 100
- Bandages used: 25
- Total bandages at the end of Day 3: \(x - 16 - 25 + 100 = x + 69\)

According to the problem, at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left:
\[x + 69 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 69\]
\[x = 9\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum up all the amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: \(6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00\)
2. For doing his laundry: \(1 \times \$3.00 = \$3.00\)
3. For taking the trash to the curb: \(2 \times \$0.75 = \$1.50\)
4. For cleaning his room: \(1 \times \$1.50 = \$1.50\)

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
\$3.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.50 + \$1.50 = \$9.00

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. The problem states that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. **Initial amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. **After the children drank**: They drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **After the wife spilled**: She spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. **After Ronnie took some**: He took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which they shared equally. Therefore, each person gets:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
\]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

Adding these together, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is \(8 + 18 = 26\).

Next, let's account for the colors stolen and used:

- Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(4\) colors are stolen.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors used.

Subtracting the stolen and used colors from the total:

- Colors stolen: \(4\)
- Colors used: \(3\)

So, the total number of colors subtracted is \(4 + 3 = 7\).

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(26 - 7 = 19\).

**19**"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \)
2. Height of the first floor: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \)

Since the house is two-story and the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height from the second floor to the roof can be calculated by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

3. Height from the second floor to the roof: \( 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \)

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams. Subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Now, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all four dogs is \( 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
4 miles."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his house.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Last tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the buying price from it.

1. Calculate the selling price:
   - Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.
   - Buying price = $72.
   - Selling price = \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \).

2. Perform the multiplication:
   - \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \).

3. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Selling price - Buying price.
   - Profit = $99 - $72 = $27.

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is \( 2 \times 1 \, \text{liter/day} = 2 \, \text{liters/day} \).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{liters/day} = 4 \, \text{liters/day} \).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \( 29 \) liters."

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Each of John's classes has a capacity that is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 borrowed.

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is also:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, it is already over capacity with 270 people on board. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 0, as the bus is already at full capacity and over.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \) and the number of brownies as \( b \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

Each of the five people in the class gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a pedicure is $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has.

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the new price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price is now 50% of the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price of the toy after the discount in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from his standard lessons. He charges $80 per hour and has 4 such lessons.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with veterans. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Charlie has 2 veteran lessons at this reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the money Walter received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the problem using the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[
9 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
\]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he drives continuously without any stops for relaxation or gas, which is an ideal scenario for calculation purposes), the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, the total number of grapes is unknown, but we know that after Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes were used to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, let's denote the initial number of grapes as \( x \). The grapes used by Madeline and her brother are 6 and 30 respectively, so the remaining grapes are:

\[ x - 6 - 30 = x - 36 \]

We know that these remaining grapes were used to make the pies, so:

\[ x - 36 = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 48 + 36 \]
\[ x = 84 \]

So, the initial number of grapes was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down the costs and then calculate the annual expenditure.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost of pasta} + \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of gruyere cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Annual Cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is:
     \[
     \text{Annual cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52
     \]
     \[
     \text{Annual cost} = 10 \times 52 = 520 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Bud spends $520 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in 5 days. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in minutes per day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total working time is:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of their total working time is spent cleaning the classrooms. The percentage of the day spent cleaning is calculated as follows:

\[ \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, on average, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[ 15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{\$1}{3 \text{ eggs}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Rose has 5 dozens of eggs, which is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at \(\frac{1}{3}\) dollars per egg is:
\[ 60 \text{ eggs} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[
\text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00 per bag, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price per bag is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ 50 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions from both tests.

The total number of questions from both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these questions correctly:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

To find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already answered correctly from the total number she needs to pass:

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is given by the expression:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the totals.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights per person + Flashlights per room
   - Total flashlights = 4 (people) + (2 flashlights/room * 8 rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in total.
   - Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Total candles = (4 small candles/room * 4 rooms) + (5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms)
   - Total candles = (4 * 4) + (5 * 4)
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. **First side**: It takes John 5 minutes.
2. **Second and third sides**: Each takes twice the time of the first side, so:
   - Second side: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes
   - Third side: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes
3. **Fourth and fifth sides**: Each takes half the time of the first side, so:
   - Fourth side: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes
   - Fifth side: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes
4. **Sixth side**: Once the fifth side is done, the sixth side takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Now, let's sum up the total time:

- Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Now, add these amounts to get the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\$235.00\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We can find this by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \]

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade.

1. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the main 4 gallons:**
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, Tim needs \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon:**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for the extra gallon, Tim needs \(2 \times 1 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice needed = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon.
   - Total lemon juice needed = \(4 + 2 = 6\) cups of lemon juice.

4. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of juice, Tim will need \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

**Final Answer:**
Tim will need 36 lemons."

"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

1. Let the number of blue blocks be \( B \).
2. Let the number of yellow blocks be \( Y \).
3. Let the number of red blocks be \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of blue blocks \( B = 4 \).
- The number of yellow blocks \( Y = 2 \times B = 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as:
\[ B + Y + R = 32 \]

Substituting the known values of \( B \) and \( Y \):
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, the number of orange candies is \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Now, let's add up the candies we know about:
- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Total known candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total known candies from the total number of candies:

Number of pink candies = Total candies - Known candies
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189 = 43

So, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the hotel:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Cost of the bus trips:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**

   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Cost of shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is \(40 \times 0.6 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - The total amount Jake spends is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.
   - Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is **36 dollars**."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he bought 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the total allowance to find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one ticket:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy \(\boxed{2}\) movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.

So, Ellen's total expenditure is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.

So, the cost of the two bathrobes is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Adding the cost of the sunglasses to the cost of the bathrobes, Lani's total expenditure is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total expenditures to find the overall amount spent:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ellen and Lani spent in all is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Next, we calculate the profit for one jar:
- Selling price per jar = $50
- Cost per jar = $44
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

Now, we calculate the profit for 10 jars:
- Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

Final numerical answer:
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spends at the mall.

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so for two people it's \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount given by her parents:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has \(\boxed{13}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

Therefore, Josh makes \(\$120\) in 2 weeks."

\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Matthew would earn \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \, \text{holes filled} - 6 \, \text{holes dug} = 3 \, \text{holes filled per day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

**Final Answer:**
4 weeks"
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = \text{Norman High School's average enrollment} - \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

   \text{Number of test tubes Igor gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Determine the number of beakers Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
   - Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa ran, Aaron ran:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, Aaron's speed is:
\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Using her speed:
\[ \text{Time taken by Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took:

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total required.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line required.
Since the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy a total of 594 feet of line."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night's reservations.

- Each meal costs $5, and they order 2 meals per reservation.
- Therefore, the cost of meals per reservation is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
- So, the total cost per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night is:
\[6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars}\]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total cost for the week is:
\[90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount they make in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the total cost for the mechanic's work is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

To find out how many slices each person can have, divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
