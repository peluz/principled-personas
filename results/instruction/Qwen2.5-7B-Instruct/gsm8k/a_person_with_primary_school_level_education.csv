"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for muffins. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells each egg for $2. So, the money she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. 

In total, it takes 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts. 

Final numerical answer: 3"
"First, we need to find out the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the original purchase price of $80,000:
150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

Now, we add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house:
$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we need to find out the total cost for Josh, which includes the purchase price and the repair costs:
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repair costs) = $130,000

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
$200,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total cost) = $70,000

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 60 meters in each sprint. He does 3 sprints each time. So, in one session, he runs:

60 meters/sprint × 3 sprints = 180 meters

He does this 3 times a week. So, in a week, he runs:

180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Final numerical answer:
540 meters"
"First, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in a day. She gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total cups given in these two meals is:

15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups

Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed a day. With 20 chickens, the total feed needed for all the chickens in a day is:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, we know that Wendi has already given 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. To find out how many cups are left for the final meal, we subtract the already given feed from the total needed:

60 cups (total needed) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"Kylar is buying 16 glasses. Every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's find the cost of the second glass:
60% of $5 = 0.60 * $5 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the glasses. Kylar will have 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each because he is buying 16 glasses in total.

Cost for the first 8 glasses:
8 * $5 = $40

Cost for the next 8 glasses:
8 * $3 = $24

Now, let's add both costs together:
$40 + $24 = $64

Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

$64"
"Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has:
4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has:
2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have:
160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep.

260"
"First, let's find out how much of the file is 40% of 200 GB.

40% of 200 GB = 0.40 × 200 GB = 80 GB

Carla can download 2 GB per minute. So, to download 80 GB, it would take:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, after 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, and this restart takes 20 minutes. So, the total time so far is:

40 minutes (downloading 80 GB) + 20 minutes (restart) = 60 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the 200 GB file from the beginning again. So, the total time to download the entire file is:

60 minutes (initial download and restart) + 200 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute (re-downloading the whole file) = 60 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

So, it takes 160 minutes to download the file."
"First, let's calculate how far John is from home after driving for 3 hours at 60 mph.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move during this time. 

Next, he drives for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours) at 30 mph.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

After that, he drives the remaining time at 80 mph. He has 4 hours in total to get home, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph).

Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances he has covered to find out how far he is from home.

Total distance covered = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, and he has covered 135 miles, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour. For the extra 5 hours, she gets overtime pay.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her overtime rate:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Now, we calculate her overtime pay:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Finally, we add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings:
$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month. So, we calculate:
60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%. First, we find 30% of 180:
30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

So, the downloads in the third month were:
180 downloads - 54 downloads = 126 downloads.

Now, we add up the downloads from all three months:
60 downloads (first month) + 180 downloads (second month) + 126 downloads (third month) = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen. So, the cost of the donuts is:
3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen. So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is:
2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is:
6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total cost:
$204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694

So, the total cost is $694."
"Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting the tree and the yearly costs of watering and feeding it before he starts earning money. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Yearly Costs**: It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.
3. **Yearly Income**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. So, the yearly income is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after covering the yearly costs:
- Net profit per year = Yearly income - Yearly costs = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to cover the initial cost of $90 with the net profit of $7.5 per year. We can set up the equation:
\[ 7.5 \times \text{number of years} = 90 \]

Solving for the number of years:
\[ \text{number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the orange house.
2. Before selling to the orange house, she had twice as many vacuum cleaners as she has now, because she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners before the orange house.
3. Before selling to the red house, she had 2 more vacuum cleaners than she had before the orange house, because she sold 2 to the red house. So, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners before the red house.
4. Before selling to the green house, she had three times as many vacuum cleaners as she had before the red house, because she sold a third at the green house. So, she had \(12 \times 3 = 36\) vacuum cleaners before the green house.

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

36"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 

20% of 20 students is:
20% × 20 = 0.20 × 20 = 4 students

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. Now, let's see how many students are left:
20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 is:
25% × 16 = 0.25 × 16 = 4 students

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. Now, let's see how many students are left for hip-hop dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) × 100 = 0.60 × 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To find out which purchase will give the merchant the most profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase.

First, let's calculate the profit from the jewelry:
- The jewelry is worth $5,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.

To find the profit, we calculate 2.5% of $5,000:
\[ 2.5\% \text{ of } 5000 = \frac{2.5}{100} \times 5000 = 0.025 \times 5000 = 125 \]

So, the profit from the jewelry is $125.

Next, let's calculate the profit from the electronic gadgets:
- The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.

To find the profit, we calculate 1.2% of $8,000:
\[ 1.2\% \text{ of } 8000 = \frac{1.2}{100} \times 8000 = 0.012 \times 8000 = 96 \]

So, the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96.

Comparing the two profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit. The final profit would be $125."
"The first day, each train travels 80 miles westward. The next day, each train travels 150 miles northward. 

To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earns from teaching each week. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week as a teacher. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 35 \text{ hours/week} = 700 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from being a cheerleading coach. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week as a coach. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours/week} = 450 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total each week from both jobs. We add her weekly earnings from teaching and coaching:

\[ 700 \text{ dollars/week} + 450 \text{ dollars/week} = 1150 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Jill works 50 weeks a year. To find her annual salary, we multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:

\[ 1150 \text{ dollars/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 57500 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:

\[ 57500 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:

3 eggs/day × 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

In 4 weeks, she will eat:

21 eggs/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:

84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

7 dozens"
"Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles). The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. So, she has 6 miles left to walk.

To have an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, she needs to complete the hike in 3 hours (since 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours).

She has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the distance by the time:

6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Now, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled. Since the spill is random, we assume the proportion of water in the spilled part is the same as the whole drink, which is two-thirds. So, the spilled part contains:

\[ \text{Water in spilled part} = \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the remaining orange drink has:

\[ \text{Remaining water in orange drink} = 6.67 - 0.67 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the remaining water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Samantha is 31 years old now. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age of 25.

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to his first 3 customers, and each bought 1 DVD. So, that's 3 DVDs.

Then, he sold DVDs to his next 2 customers, and each bought 2 DVDs. So, that's 2 customers times 2 DVDs, which equals 4 DVDs.

His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold: 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the $19.50 Kyle paid is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's call the original price of the book \( P \).

Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's find out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

The chicken meal costs $12.
5 packs of milk at $3 each cost 5 * $3 = $15.
4 apples at $1.50 each cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up these costs:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we add up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

So, the total amount Mishka spent is \(49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243\) dollars.

Therefore, Mishka spent 243 dollars on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. So, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to find out how many cartons she will need for 60 days. We do this by dividing the total servings by the servings per carton:

60 servings ÷ 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

4 cartons × $4.00/carton = $16.00

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.

$16.00"
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to travel. His second stop was 15 miles before the end, so he had 15 miles to travel after his second stop. This means between his first and second stops, he traveled 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

25 miles"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. One pair of heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
3. Together, the two pairs of heels cost \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.
4. The boots cost five dollars more than the two pairs of heels combined, so the boots cost \(99 + 5 = 104\) dollars.

So, the boots cost 104 dollars."
"First, let's understand the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age, which is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts.

The total parts of their ages together is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

Now, we know their total age is 162. So, each part is:
162 ÷ 18 = 9

Allen's current age is 11 parts, so:
11 × 9 = 99

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed.

The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first one. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, to find the average guess, we add all the guesses together and then divide by the number of guesses.

So, 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide 240 by 3.

240 ÷ 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"John spends 0.5 hours a day on each dog. He has 10 dogs, so he spends:

0.5 hours/dog/day * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

There are 7 days in a week, so he spends:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Final numerical answer:
35"
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. The number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \) because there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.
3. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation: \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ S + S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:

\[ \text{Gold coins} = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels.

Half of Raymond's jewels is:
40 ÷ 2 = 20

So, Aaron has 5 more than this:
20 + 5 = 25

Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels:
25 - 2 = 23

Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 1 point more than in the first 20 minutes. That means he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, to find the total points he scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:
2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
60 yogurts ÷ 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
15 sets × $5.00/set = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells his lego sets for $15 each. He sells 13 lego sets, so he earns:
13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total money he had before buying the video games was:
$160 (spent on video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since he earned $195 from selling the lego sets, and he had $165 after buying the video games, he still has:
$195 (total from selling lego sets) - $165 (total spent) = $30

This $30 is the money he would have from selling the remaining lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
$30 / $15/lego set = 2 lego sets

Final numerical answer:
2"
"John runs 3 hours on the first day. On the other two days, he runs half as much, so that's 1.5 hours each day.

On the first day, he runs 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs 1.5 hours each, so that's 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 hours.

In total, he runs 3 + 3 = 6 hours a week.

He runs 60 miles a week in 6 hours.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours.

60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's find out how fast Dana can run and walk.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and this is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by doubling the skipping speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{miles per hour} \]

Now, since she can run four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing the running speed by 4:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = 6 \, \text{miles per hour} \div 4 = 1.5 \, \text{miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 2 \, \text{hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \, \text{miles} + 6 \, \text{miles} = 18 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Dana can travel 18 miles in six hours."
"Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so:
\[ \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so:
\[ \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years} \]

Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than usual. Normally, she can throw the javelin for 400 feet. So, with the gemstone, she can throw it:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

The dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet. So, Polly can stand 1200 feet away and still hit the dragon. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach she can be, we subtract the dragon's reach from the javelin's throw distance:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, we need to find out how many pieces of apple pie were there in total. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the total calories in the bag by multiplying 250 by 5.

250 calories/serving × 5 servings = 1250 calories

Now, let's see how many more calories you can consume to reach your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so we subtract that from your target.

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the whole bag (1250 calories) is 300g, we can find out how many grams are in 200 calories by setting up a proportion.

1250 calories : 300g = 200 calories : x grams

To find x, we can use the formula:

x = (200 calories × 300g) / 1250 calories

x = 60000 / 1250

x = 48 grams

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. If he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax.

The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. So, for 2 pounds, it will be $10.00 x 2 = $20.00.

He sells each candle for $2.00. So, for 20 candles, he will earn $2.00 x 20 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

So, his net profit is $20.00."
"First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in these three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. 

First, we need to find out how many post-it notes she used in total. She used 220 post-it notes at work and had 23 left, so she used \(220 + 23 = 243\) post-it notes in total.

Next, we need to find out how many post-it notes were in the package she bought. She started with 80 post-it notes and ended up using 243 post-it notes. So, the number of post-it notes in the package is \(243 - 80 = 163\).

The final numerical answer is:
163"
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the red ties:

Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

Total spent on ties = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties = $200 + $600 = $800

So, John spent $800 on ties."
"First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be made from 48 inches. We do this by dividing 48 by 6.

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, we need to find out how many units are in the whole building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying 15 by 8.

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Since 90 units are occupied, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the occupied units from the total units.

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd has each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

252 eggs ÷ 12 = 21 dozens

Next, we need to find out how much Lloyd makes per day from selling these dozens of eggs. He sells each dozen for $2.

21 dozens × $2 = $42

Now, to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

$42 × 7 = $294

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"Tom's ship travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

First, let's find the distance:
- Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
- He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance back is also 30 miles, and he travels back at 6 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes to travel back:
- Time = Distance ÷ Speed
- Time = 30 miles ÷ 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, we need to find out how much weight the comic books remove. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, we can calculate the total weight of the comic books as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound per comic book} = \frac{30}{4} \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys as follows:

\[ \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

15"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Now, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. We compare the total revenue for Thursday and Friday:

- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue is:

- $520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens. Their mother's cats, Patchy and Trixie, have also had kittens. Patchy has three times the number of adopted kittens, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 kittens. Trixie has 12 kittens.

Now, let's add all the kittens together:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

7 + 21 + 12 = 40

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops. After eating 2, Jean has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in one bag. So, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, which totals $7 + $7 = $14 for one trip to the movies. He has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total money he has by the cost of one trip: $42 ÷ $14 = 3. 

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"First, we need to find out how much weight is left for the boxes after the driver and the empty truck are on the bridge. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

So, the remaining weight for the boxes is:
5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:
1245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"First, we need to find out the cost of the groceries before the extra fees. The final bill is $40.00, which includes a 25% fee and $3.00 in delivery fees, plus a $4.00 tip.

To find the original cost of the groceries, we need to subtract the delivery fees and the tip from the final bill. So, we do:

$40.00 (final bill) - $3.00 (delivery fees) - $4.00 (tip) = $33.00

This $33.00 is the cost of the groceries before the 25% fee was added. The 25% fee is calculated on the original cost of the groceries, which is $33.00. To find the 25% fee, we calculate:

25% of $33.00 = 0.25 * $33.00 = $8.25

Now, we add this 25% fee to the original cost of the groceries and the delivery fees and tip to get the final price:

$33.00 (original cost) + $8.25 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) + $4.00 (tip) = $48.25

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $48.25."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the raspberries in the clusters to the scattered raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
- There are 6 clusters.
- Each cluster has 20 raspberries.

So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Next, we add the 67 scattered raspberries to the 120 raspberries from the clusters:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ 187 \]"
"First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. We know that 20% of the 25 oranges are unripe. So, we calculate 20% of 25:

20% of 25 = 0.20 × 25 = 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Now, we know there is 1 bad orange, 2 sour oranges, and 5 unripe oranges. Let's add these up:

1 (bad) + 2 (sour) + 5 (unripe) = 8

So, there are 8 oranges that are not good.

Now, we subtract these 8 oranges from the total number of oranges to find out how many are good:

25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17

So, there are 17 good oranges.

Final numerical answer:
17"
"Janet first spends $500 on material and $800 on the jeweler to construct the brooch. So, the total cost for the material and construction is:

$500 + $800 = $1300

Next, she pays 10% of this total amount to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of the material and construction:

$1300 + $130 = $1430

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"Marcy gets a regular annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years. After 20 years, she starts getting an additional 5% of the pension value each year.

For the 21st to 30th year, she gets the regular $50,000 plus 5% of $50,000.

First, let's calculate 5% of $50,000:
5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

So, after 20 years, she gets an additional $2,500 each year.

Now, let's add the regular pension and the additional 5%:
$50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $52,500.

$52,500"
"First, we need to find out how much Aleena pays for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in half a year, we multiply the monthly charge by 6:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less. To find 10% of $140, we calculate:

$140 * 10% = $140 * 0.10 = $14

So, the charge for the second half of the year is:

$140 - $14 = $126 per month

Since there are also 6 months in the second half of the year, we multiply the new monthly charge by 6:

$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts for the first and second halves of the year to find the total amount paid for the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to figure out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. So, we can divide the miles driven by the gallons used to find the miles per gallon.

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank.

25 miles per gallon × 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 1 hour each time. 

Each time he does this, he spends a total of 2 hours (watching TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so each week he spends 3 hours x 3 times = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week x 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for players:
- Each school sends 5 players for the girls' team and 5 players for the boys' team, which is 5 + 5 = 10 players per school.
- Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players.

For coaches:
- Each school sends 2 coaches, so for 4 schools, the total number of coaches is 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Now, we add the players and coaches together:
- Total people = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

140 rubies × 2 = 280 emeralds

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 595 gems

So, there were 595 gems in the chest."
"There are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can find the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 60 girls * 2 = 120 boys

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of students.

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students

If there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 students / 5 = 36 teachers

36 teachers"
"Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she gets from her allowance is:

$5 x 8 = $40

Tommy raises $221."
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the five cell phones before interest. Each cell phone costs $150, and Shiela bought five of them.

So, the total cost before interest is:
\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, we add the interest to the total cost to find the total amount Shiela needs to pay:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount in 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ 765 \div 3 = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay each month:
\[ 255 \]

Each month, Shiela will pay $255."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to figure out the square footage of each level.

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. The second level will have twice the square footage of the top level, so it will be \(16 \times 2 = 32\).
3. The third level will have twice the square footage of the second level, so it will be \(32 \times 2 = 64\).
4. The bottom level will have twice the square footage of the third level, so it will be \(64 \times 2 = 128\).

Now, we add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 60."
"Cecilia has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year includes 365 days. 

To find out how many cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year, we need to subtract the first 180 days from the total days in a year:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days

For these 185 days, the puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food each day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 185 days is:

185 days * 1 cup/day = 185 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:

185 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.6818 bags

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 2 bags of dog food to have enough for the first year.

"First, we need to find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4.

So, David does:
\[ \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds of laundry} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

So, Raymond does:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds of laundry} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. We subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does.

So, the difference is:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"First, let's see how many packages Vincent would need to buy 18 flowers at each price.

For the packages of 3 flowers:
18 flowers ÷ 3 flowers/package = 6 packages

For the packages of 2 flowers:
18 flowers ÷ 2 flowers/package = 9 packages

Now, let's calculate the cost for each option.

For the packages of 3 flowers:
6 packages × $2.50/package = $15.00

For the packages of 2 flowers:
9 packages × $1.00/package = $9.00

Now, let's find out how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better price.

The better price is the one that costs less. Here, the packages of 2 flowers cost less.

The cost difference is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"First, we need to find out how much the 30% discount is. To do this, we take 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 × $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost.

$100 - $30 = $70

So, the grooming cost is $70."
"First, we need to find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this by:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to add the amount of water the boy got, which is 6 liters:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy from the original 24 liters to find out how much water is left:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final answer is:

10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought) + 23 (birthday) = 54 stickers.

Next, Charlie gave away 9 stickers and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. So, we subtract those:

54 - 9 (gave to sister) - 28 (used for card) = 17 stickers.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

To find Alex's weight, we multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2 pounds:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many roses Dan has in total. Since Dan plants 3 rose bushes and each rose bush has 25 roses, we can calculate the total number of roses by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:

3 rose bushes * 25 roses per bush = 75 roses

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Since each rose has 8 thorns, we can calculate the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the team lost \( L \) games.
2. Then they won \( L + 8 \) games because they won 8 more than they lost.
3. The total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation: \( L + (L + 8) = 22 \).
4. Simplify the equation: \( 2L + 8 = 22 \).
5. Subtract 8 from both sides: \( 2L = 14 \).
6. Divide both sides by 2: \( L = 7 \).

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) games.

The final answer is 15."
"Gene has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he goes on four vacations each year, the total number of vacation t-shirts (which are the quilt blocks) he has is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

44 quilt blocks"
"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang 4 times * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

To find out how many times the alarm rang in all, we add up all the times: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10%. So, her new salary after 5 years is:

$600 + ($600 * 10/100) = $600 + $60 = $660 per month.

Now, she has been working for 5 years and will work for 3 more years, making it 8 years in total. Each year, her salary increases by 10%. We need to calculate her salary after 3 more years.

After the first year (6 years total):
$660 + ($660 * 10/100) = $660 + $66 = $726 per month.

After the second year (7 years total):
$726 + ($726 * 10/100) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60 per month.

After the third year (8 years total):
$798.60 + ($798.60 * 10/100) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46 per month.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46 per month."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say Harald's record sold \( x \) copies.
2. Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so it sold \( 10x \) copies.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. So, \( x + 10x = 88,000 \).
4. This means \( 11x = 88,000 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide 88,000 by 11: \( x = 88,000 ÷ 11 \).
6. \( 88,000 ÷ 11 = 8,000 \).

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will actually come.

To find out how many guests will come, we calculate 3/4 of 16:
3/4 * 16 = 12

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:
.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags

Each gift bag costs $2. So, the total cost for 9 gift bags is:
9 * $2 = $18

Christina will spend $18."
"First, we need to find out how much potato salad a child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:

10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs

Next, we calculate how much potato salad all the adults will eat. There are 20 adults, and each will eat 10 lbs, so:

20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Now, we calculate how much potato salad all the children will eat. There are 5 children, and each will eat 5 lbs, so:

5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Finally, we add the amount of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount Ted needs to bring:

200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the pets each one has:
Cindy's pets (4) + Marcia's pets (6) + Jan's pets (18) = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

The final numerical answer is:
28"
"Let's figure out the ages step by step.

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Lee used to run 400 meters in 38 - 2 = 36 seconds.
Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than before. So, if we let Gerald's original time be \( T \) seconds, then \( T - 0.1T = 36 \) seconds.
This means \( 0.9T = 36 \).
To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.9: \( T = 36 / 0.9 = 40 \) seconds.
Now, with his improved diet, Gerald runs 10% faster, so his new time is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds less.
Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Final answer: 36 seconds."
"First, let's find out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. So, we calculate:

200 students * 2/5 = 80 boys

Now, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since the rest of the students are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

200 students - 80 boys = 120 girls

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so we calculate:

120 girls * 2/3 = 80 girls in the girl scout

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

120 girls - 80 girls in the girl scout = 40 girls not in the girl scout

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"Harry slept 9 hours.

James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, we need to find 2/3 of 9 hours.

To do this, we multiply 9 by 2/3:
9 * 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 hours.

So, James slept 6 hours.

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"First, we need to understand that when Freda cooks the canned tomatoes, they lose half their volume. This means that the sauce she makes is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. After cooking, the volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. Since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking would be 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. So, to find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes before cooking by the volume of one can:

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Each can contains three tomatoes. So, to find out the total number of tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 30 minutes, 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars left in the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
3. In the second 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
4. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in 30 minutes is 25 (remaining after 5 cars took an exit) + 20 (new cars that drove through) = 45 cars.
5. But we need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Since 45 cars drove through in 30 minutes and 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 45 - 20 = 25 cars.

So, 25 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Mary starts with 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, she has:

2 plants/ledge × 40 ledges = 80 plants

Yesterday, she received 18 more potted plants. So, she now has:

80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:

1 plant/ledge × 40 ledges = 40 plants

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]
Then, we add this to the first friend's presses:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, we add 10 to the fourth friend's presses:
\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \]

Now, we add all the presses together:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

The doorbell made 175 rings."
"First, let's find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total.

Solo has to read:
- 4 pages from his Science textbook
- 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook
- 7 pages from his History textbook
- 8 pages from his Geography textbook

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average in one day.

6 pages"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. That's 3 glasses of water per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks:

3 glasses/day × 5 days = 15 glasses of water

On weekends, he doesn't drink water with dinner, so he only drinks water with breakfast and lunch, which is 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 days in the weekend, he drinks:

2 glasses/day × 2 days = 4 glasses of water

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:

15 glasses + 4 glasses = 19 glasses

Final answer:
19"
"The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cover 42 miles, we can divide 42 by 3 to find out how many 3-mile segments there are, and then multiply that by 10 minutes.

42 miles ÷ 3 miles = 14 segments

14 segments × 10 minutes = 140 minutes

It will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"First, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces.

1000 pieces / 4 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.

1000 pieces - 250 pieces = 750 pieces

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces.

750 pieces / 3 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy's mom places 250 pieces on the board. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom places her pieces.

750 pieces - 250 pieces = 500 pieces

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."
"Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Together, Cody and Amir eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies."
"First, we need to find the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

For the length, 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches.
For the width, 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches.
For the height, 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of one box using the formula for volume, which is length x width x height.

Volume of one box = 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Final numerical answer:
72 cubic inches"
"Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours over the week. Let's break it down:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and a 30-minute show, which is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours (2 one-hour episodes).
- So far, he watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

The total time he watched TV is 7 hours. So, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the time by 0.5.

1.5 ÷ 0.5 = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry baked \( x \) cookies last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many, so he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. But he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He dropped 5 cookies, so he now has \( 2x + 15 - 5 \) cookies.
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year."
"First, we need to find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without the cashback. 

The cost per gallon is $3.00. So, for 10 gallons, the cost is:
$3.00 × 10 = $30.00

Next, we calculate the cashback. The app company offers $.20 cashback per gallon. For 10 gallons, the cashback is:
$.20 × 10 = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out the final amount:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, after the cashback rewards, the gas will cost $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to add the number of roll-ups each of them had.

First, let's count the roll-ups Beatrice had. Beatrice's roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, we multiply the width by the length:
2 (width) × 24 (length) = 48 roll-ups

Next, let's count the roll-ups Marcell had. Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, we multiply the width by the length:
3 (width) × 14 (length) = 42 roll-ups

Now, we add the number of roll-ups each of them had to find the total:
48 (Beatrice's roll-ups) + 42 (Marcell's roll-ups) = 90 roll-ups

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
90 (total roll-ups) ÷ 2 (people) = 45 roll-ups

So, on average, they ate 45 roll-ups."
"First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. We know it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, we can find out how many 16-second intervals are in 64 seconds:

64 seconds / 16 seconds = 4 intervals

Since each interval is 20 feet, we can find out the total distance by multiplying the number of intervals by the distance per interval:

4 intervals * 20 feet per interval = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet:

80 feet / 10 feet = 8 segments

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each 10-foot segment, we can find out the total amount of water by multiplying the number of segments by the amount of water per segment:

8 segments * 2 liters per segment = 16 liters

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water."
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard in 2 lessons per day. So, for one teacher, the whiteboard is cleaned 2 times (once per lesson) x 3 (times cleaned per lesson) = 6 times.

"First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6.

1800 ÷ 6 = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. To find the number of ducks, we divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

300 ÷ 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, let's find out how much Sasha originally spent on the boards.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought ten of them at $10 each.
- So, she spent 10 * $10 = $100 on these boards.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought five of them at $16 each.
- So, she spent 5 * $16 = $80 on these boards.

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, we need to find out how much she can sell these boards for. Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is:
- $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.

And the new price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is:
- $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price:
- For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150.
- For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120.

Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can find out how many teaspoons each part represents by dividing 120 by 20. So, 120 ÷ 20 = 6 teaspoons per part.

Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used. So, 7 × 6 = 42 teaspoons.

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John has 3 children and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. So, he buys shoes for a total of:

3 children * 2 pairs of shoes/child = 6 pairs of shoes

Each pair of shoes costs $60. So, the total cost for 6 pairs of shoes is:

6 pairs * $60/pair = $360

He paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out how much Adrien earned four years ago. We know Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. To find the new salary, we calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original amount.

40% of $40,000 is:
\[ 40,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40,000 \times 0.4 = 16,000 \]

So, Adrien's new salary is:
\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lylah earned four years ago. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be \( L \), then Adrien's salary four years ago was \( L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).

Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.3L = 40,000 \]

To find Lylah's salary, we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Now, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. So, her new salary is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 99,076.92 \]"
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper.

So, in a week, he uses:
2 pads × 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets

- 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday
- 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Wednesday

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. So, she slept:
- 6 + 1 = 7 hours on Thursday
- 6 + 1 = 7 hours on Friday
- 6 + 1 = 7 hours on Saturday
- 6 + 1 = 7 hours on Sunday

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 46 hours

So, Sadie slept 46 hours in total throughout the week."
"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, in 3 hours, she runs:
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

After 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. There are 7 hours in total, so she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left to run at 5 miles per hour.

In the remaining 4 hours, she runs:
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

So, the total distance she runs in 7 hours is:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Final numerical answer:
50 miles"
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, she put stamps on:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

This means 20 letters got stamps. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This includes the 20 letters that Jennie just stamped and the letters that were already stamped before she started. So, the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie began is:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Final numerical answer:
30"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. She had 12 spoons left to set the table.

First, we need to find out how many spoons Julia had before she used 3 of them. If she had 12 spoons after using 3, then she must have had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons before using them.

Next, we know that the total number of spoons she had before using any was the sum of the spoons in the package she bought and the 5 spoons her husband gave her. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, then:

\[ x + 5 = 15 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 15 - 5 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Final answer: 10"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the chicken sausages and fish sausages together:
38 + 44 = 82

Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"Lily made 50 friends.

Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends."
"First, let's find out how much a watermelon costs. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much an orange costs. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each item Dillon needs to buy:

- For 4 watermelons: \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \)
- For 20 peppers: \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \)
- For 10 oranges: \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \)

Finally, we add up all these amounts to find the total cost:

\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:

\[ 880 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many minutes the hospital spends seeing patients each day. Since they see 500 people a day and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, we multiply 500 by 24.

500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes

Now, we need to convert these minutes into hours because the charges are given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 12,000 by 60.

12,000 / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients. So, the total amount charged to patients is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital. So, the total amount the hospital pays to the doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

To find the profit, we subtract the amount the hospital pays to the doctors from the amount charged to the patients.

$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"First, we need to find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of 60 elves is calculated as:

60 ÷ 3 = 20 elves

So, 20 elves quit. Now we subtract these from the original number of elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the 40 that are left:

40 - 10 = 30 elves

So, the final number of elves left is 30."
"Joseph's expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

To find the total expenditure for May and June, we add the two amounts together:
$500 + $440 = $940.

So, his total expenditure for those two months was $940."
"Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. So, she used:
- Roller coaster: 2 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
- Luge: 2 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
Total for Pam: 12 + 12 = 24 tickets

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. So, he used:
- Roller coaster: 4 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets
- Luge: 2 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
Total for Fred: 24 + 12 = 36 tickets

Together, Pam and Fred used:
24 tickets (Pam) + 36 tickets (Fred) = 60 tickets

Final numerical answer:
60"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

So, \(41 - 4 - 24 = 13\) miles.

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month. Each car wash costs $15. 

First, we find out how much he pays each month:
4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Now, we need to find out how much he pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally had 20 video games. But he lost 5, so he now has:
20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian now has. So first, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:
3 * 15 = 45.

Now, we subtract 5 from that number to find out how many video games Bobby has:
45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

9 × 2/3 = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, let's find out how much the subs cost. Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each, so:
2 * $7.50 = $15.00

Next, the bags of chips. She orders 2 bags at $1.50 each, so:
2 * $1.50 = $3.00

Then, the cookies. She orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so:
2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

There's a 20% delivery fee on the total cost. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the order:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add the tip to the total:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Since he had 8 hours to complete the test, he could have answered \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions. However, the first test had 75 questions, so he completed \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions of the first test.

For the second test, he had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. In 6 hours, he could have answered \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions. Since the second test had 100 questions, he left \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions incomplete.

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is \(35 + 70 = 105\).

105"
"First, we need to find out how many pink gumballs there are. We know that there are 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs as pink gumballs. 

We have 12 blue gumballs. Four times the number of blue gumballs would be:
4 * 12 = 48

Now, we add 22 to this number to find the number of pink gumballs:
48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"First, we need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. So, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) × 100

Percentage = (4 / 20) × 100
Percentage = 0.2 × 100
Percentage = 20%

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of queens is Q.
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q.
3. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 times the number of baby bees, which is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.
4. So, the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. That means Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.
5. This simplifies to 7Q = 700.
6. To find Q, we divide both sides by 7: Q = 700 / 7 = 100.
7. Now, we know there are 4Q worker bees, so we calculate 4 * 100 = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

Final numerical answer:

"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week.

If Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours each day. He earns $10 an hour at his part-time job.

To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to multiply the number of hours he works each day by the number of days in a week and then by his hourly wage.

So, the calculation is:
2 hours/day × 7 days/week × $10/hour

Let's do the math:
2 × 7 × 10 = 14 × 10 = $140

Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's find out which items are nonfood. The light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are nonfood items. 

The cost of nonfood items is:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of nonfood items before tax is:
3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we need to calculate the 10% tax on these nonfood items:
10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of nonfood items including tax is:
10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items is:
2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the cost of food items and nonfood items with tax:
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final numerical answer is:
16 dollars"
"First, let's find out how many clients Kim will have in total. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more potential clients. So, the total number of clients will be:

3 + 5 = 8 clients

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies for each client. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. So, the total cost for each client is:

2 bottles of bleach * $2/bottle = $4
1 pack of cloths * $5/pack = $5
Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9

Now, we calculate the total cost for all 8 clients:

8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

$92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, in one hectare, John can have 100 pineapples.

Since John has 10 hectares, he can have:
100 pineapples/hectare × 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. In a year, there are 12 months. So, the number of times he can harvest in a year is:
12 months/year ÷ 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is:
1000 pineapples/harvest × 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples

4000 pineapples"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\(500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\)

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before and hadn't returned return. So, the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours but didn't return are \( 30 - 15 + 60 = 75 \) bees.

So, in the last 6 hours, 75 bees return to the hive.

Final answer: 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours."

"First, we need to find out how long it takes for Steve to bike home and how long it takes for Tim to skateboard home.

Steve's distance: 3 miles
Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, Steve's distance in feet is:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute
Time for Steve to bike home:
15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Tim's distance: 2 miles
Tim's distance in feet is:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute
Time for Tim to skateboard home:
10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time between the two:

The winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

4 minutes"
"First, let's figure out how many tires Shawnda inflated.

- For the bicycles, each bicycle has 2 tires. So, 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For the tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires. So, 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For the unicycle, there is 1 tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, for 20 tires, the cost is:
\[20 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl has in total. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies in each pack:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we need to find out how much all the cookies cost. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the number of cookies by the cost per cookie:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

$4.00"
"Let's work backwards to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. **Final Fries:** 5 fries were left.
2. **Before Raccoon:** The raccoon took two-thirds, so one-third was left. If one-third is 5, then the whole before the raccoon took fries is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).
3. **Before Pigeons:** Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. If 15 fries were left before the pigeons, then before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\).
4. **Before Seagull:** The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 \div 2 = 7\) fries. If 24 fries were left before the seagull, then before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 7 = 31\).

So, the pack had 31 fries when Dave bought it.

"Kimo has 3 classes each day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each class is 1 hour long. So, on those days, he spends 3 hours in class.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, on those days, he spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours in class.

In one week, he spends:
- 3 hours x 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) = 9 hours
- 4 hours x 2 days (Tuesday, Thursday) = 8 hours

So, in one week, he spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, in one semester, he spends:
17 hours/week x 16 weeks = 272 hours

"First, let's find out the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

For the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- So, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

For the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- So, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

For the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- So, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, let's add up the total lengths in inches:
- Total length in inches = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
- Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in 2 months.

First, let's find out how many bananas each type of ape needs in 2 months:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month × 2 months = 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month × 2 months = 800 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month × 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, we add up the bananas needed by all the apes:

400 bananas (monkeys) + 800 bananas (gorillas) + 200 bananas (baboons) = 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's figure out how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the other end and 100 yards back). 

Blake's total distance is:
15 round trips × 200 yards per round trip = 3000 yards

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. So, each round trip is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

Kelly's total distance is:
34 round trips × 80 yards per round trip = 2720 yards

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards, and Kelly runs 2720 yards. 

The difference is:
3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."
"Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each. So, the total cost for the pens is:

He bought a rim of bond paper for $20.

To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we add the cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. So, 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. So, the depth on Tuesday was 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water was two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two thirds of 24 feet.

To find two thirds of 24, we can do this:
- First, find one third of 24: 24 ÷ 3 = 8 feet.
- Then, multiply that by 2: 8 feet × 2 = 16 feet.

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of fish Locsin caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught.

Anakin's total:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3
Total for Anakin: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\)

Locsin's total:
- Starfish: 5
- Sea horses: 3

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's find out how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:
36 ÷ 2 = 18 times

Now, each time the price increases by 20%, it means the new price is 120% of the old price. We can write 120% as 1.20 in numbers.

To find the final price after 18 increases, we multiply the original price by 1.20, 18 times. This can be written as:
$20 × (1.20)^18

Now, let's calculate this:
$20 × (1.20)^18 = $20 × 10.063157894736842
= $201.263157894736842

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $201.26.

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be $201.26."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that one red car costs $4.
2. An action figure costs $5.
3. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.
4. Now, let's find the total cost of all the toys:
   - 5 red cars at $4 each: 5 * $4 = $20
   - 3 action figures at $5 each: 3 * $5 = $15
   - 1 doll at $15: $15

5. Adding all these up: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

So, the total cost of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to find out how much money Jackie will lose by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant.

Jackie will lose $35 for each hour of freelance work she doesn't do. If she does 3 fewer hours of work, she will lose:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to know how much the accountant charges:
\[ 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the two amounts to see how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant:
\[ 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have:
\[ \boxed{15} \text{ dollars more} \]"
"Elvira's total budget is €1500. She bought a computer for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. 

First, we add up the costs of the items she bought:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"Sandra needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan. She wants to make 15 Spanish flans. So, she needs:

3 eggs/flan × 15 flans = 45 eggs

Her neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:

45 eggs ÷ 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysittings

Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say Brooke's age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years:
- Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

The sum of their ages in 2 years is 28:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 28 - 4 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 24 / 3 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16.

Then, Jimmy has $2 more than that, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

Jimmy is having $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, for those 5 days, he walks:

20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the 2 days, he walks:

10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles he walks during the weekdays and the weekends:

100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so:
\[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
\[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Each uniform costs a total of $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate the legs for the spiders:
- Jake sees 80 spiders.
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the spiders is \(80 \times 8 = 640\).

Next, let's calculate the legs for the insects:
- Jake sees 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the insects is \(90 \times 6 = 540\).

Then, let's calculate the legs for the rare mutant invertebrates:
- Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
- Each has 10 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, we add all the legs together:
- Total legs from spiders: 640
- Total legs from insects: 540
- Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: 30

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\).

Final numerical answer:
1210"
"Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
Sally Thirtytwo (8 years) + Sally Four (8 years) + Granny Red (16 years) + Sally Two (19 years) = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 41 years.

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"First, we need to find out how much Jessica wants to pay each month for each debt if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment is $300. 50% more than $300 is $300 * 1.5 = $450.

For the credit card:
Minimum payment is $200. 50% more than $200 is $200 * 1.5 = $300.

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment is $500. 50% more than $500 is $500 * 1.5 = $750.

Now, we add up the payments for all debts each month:
$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18000.

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes Billy to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, and he has 60 potatoes, we can calculate the total time for peeling as follows:

1.5 minutes per potato × 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Billy to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato, and he has 60 potatoes, we can calculate the total time for cutting as follows:

5 seconds per potato × 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

To convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

300 seconds ÷ 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together:

90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

95 minutes"
"First, let's figure out how many glasses of lemonade they sold to make $25 in profit.

Each glass is sold for $0.50. So, if they made $25 in profit, they must have sold:
\[ \text{Number of glasses sold} = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Price per glass}} = \frac{25}{0.50} = 50 \text{ glasses} \]

Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, the number of gallons they made is:
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = \frac{\text{Number of glasses sold}}{\text{Glasses per gallon}} = \frac{50}{20} = 2.5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of lemons for 2.5 gallons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so for 2.5 gallons, the cost is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 2.5 \times 3 = 7.5 \]

So, they spent $7.5 on lemons."
"First, we need to find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, we subtract the number of Japanese from the total number of Asians to find the number of Chinese.

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Now, we know that out of these 160 Chinese, 60 were boys. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese.

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

100"
"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's rent is 1/4 of his salary:
1/4 * 6000$ = 1500$

Zaid's car fuel is 1/3 of his salary:
1/3 * 6000$ = 2000$

Now, let's find out how much money is left after these expenses:
6000$ - 1500$ - 2000$ = 2500$

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
1/2 * 2500$ = 1250$

Now, let's find out how much money is left after the donation:
2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
1250$ - 200$ - 700$ = 350$

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have 350$ left."
"Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up all the crabs:
Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours. So, he earned:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours. So, he earned:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the amounts from both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got 3/4 of the votes. So, let's calculate how many votes that is out of 80.

First, we find 1/4 of 80:
80 ÷ 4 = 20

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we multiply 20 by 3:
20 × 3 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

Now, to find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:
80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of white carnations is:
200 ÷ 5 = 40

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is:
40 × 4 = 160

Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"First, let's figure out how old Mark was two years ago. We know that Jan is 30 years old now. 

Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find out how old Mark is now, we add 2 years to his age two years ago. So, Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old now.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"Let's calculate the time for each team to finish the race.

### First Team:
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Second Team:
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time:
The faster team (first team) finishes in 220 seconds, while the second team finishes in 222 seconds. The difference in time is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"First, let's figure out the chances of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]
This is 50%.

Next, let's figure out the chances of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The chance of rolling an even number is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To roll two even numbers in a row, we multiply the chances:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]
This is 25%.

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Final answer:
25%"
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. If her mom got 20 apples, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

So, the total number of apples they both picked is:
20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

They both picked 30 apples."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Hamsters' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Total Straw Used:**
   - Total straw used = Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits + Straw for rats.
   - Total straw used = 50 pieces + 20 pieces + 160 pieces = 230 pieces.

4. **Straw for Rats:**
   - We know 160 pieces of straw were used for the rats.
   - This means the remaining 70 pieces (230 - 160) were used for the hamsters and rabbits, which we already accounted for.

5. **Rats' Straw Distribution:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 160 pieces.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 160 pieces / 6 pieces = 26.6666...
   - Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and we know the rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, we need to find a whole number that fits.

6. **Finding the Number of Rats per Cage:**
   - Total number of rats = 26 (since 26 is the closest whole number that fits the distribution).
   - Rats per cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages = 26 / 3 = 8.6666...
   - Since the number of rats per cage must be a whole number, and we know the rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, the only way to fit 26 rats into 3 cages is if the number of rats per cage is 8 (since 8 * 3 = 24, and we can distribute the remaining 2 rats in a way that still fits the problem).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 8."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the original amount.

1. **First Month:**
   - Original amount: $100
   - Interest rate: 2%
   - Interest for the first month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
   - Total after first month: $100 + $2 = $102

2. **Second Month:**
   - New amount: $102
   - Interest for the second month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
   - Total after second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

3. **Third Month:**
   - New amount: $104.04
   - Interest for the third month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
   - Total after third month: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12 after 3 months."
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. Let's say the trader bought \( x \) bags of wheat.
2. The cost of buying the wheat is \( 20x \) dollars.
3. The cost of transporting the wheat is \( 2x \) dollars.
4. So, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.
5. The trader sold each bag for $30, so the total revenue is \( 30x \) dollars.
6. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is \( 30x - 22x = 8x \) dollars.
7. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation \( 8x = 400 \).
8. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8: \( x = 400 / 8 = 50 \).

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

50"
"First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since the tickets cost $20.25, the cost for food is:

$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so:

$33 x 2 = $66

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 (the number of friends):

$102 ÷ 3 = $34

So, each of them paid $34."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3 hours, there are 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

He can collect 2 peaches a minute, so in 180 minutes, he collects 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Final numerical answer: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so we need to find out how many pounds of insects one duck needs per day. We do this by dividing 3.5 by 7.
3. \(3.5 \div 7 = 0.5\) pounds per day for one duck.
4. Now, we have ten ducks, so we multiply the daily amount for one duck by 10.
5. \(0.5 \times 10 = 5\) pounds per day for ten ducks.

So, ten ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, he gains 10 - 2 = 8 trees each year.

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, he will have gained 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

So, before any trees die, he will have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 130 trees is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

So, the number of trees left after 30% die is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Final answer: 91 trees."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Friday, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is 6. So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
3. After taking back 6 pink flamingos, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
4. Then, they painted these 6 pink flamingos white and put them back. So, now there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
5. On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos became 12 + 18 = 30.
6. The number of white flamingos remained 6.

Now, to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24

At noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors. Each crayon costs $2.

First, we need to find out how much 5 crayons will cost. We do this by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon:
5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta has $20 to spend. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the money she has:
$20 - $10 = $10

So, the change Violetta will get is $10."
"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, let's find out how much a pen costs.

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, the cost of a pen is:
$1.20 (pencil) + $0.30 (eraser) = $1.50

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. If one pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens will cost:
8 × $1.50 = $12.00

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. There are 40 restaurants.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots needed for all the restaurants:
2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we know that there are 200 pounds of carrots in total. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount used from the total amount:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, the pounds of carrots that will not be used are:
120 pounds"
"To find out how many kids are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of inhabitants.

The total number of inhabitants is 23786.
The number of men is 8417.
The number of women is 9092.

First, we add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of inhabitants:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is:
20 * 3 = 60 cards

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is:
60 - 20 = 40 cards

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is:
(60 + 40) * 2 = 100 * 2 = 200 cards

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. He edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence × 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
2 × 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence

For 500 sentences at 10 cents each, he earns:
10 cents/sentence × 500 sentences = 5000 cents

So, in total, Mark makes:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. So, he gets 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day.

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

55 liters"
"First, let's find out how much John's salary is after the 5% raise. His original weekly salary is $2000.

To find the raise amount:
\[ 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary is:
\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, let's calculate his total salary for the year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

John also received a one-time monetary reward of $5000. So, we add this to his yearly salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ 114200 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we can calculate the total tons of grapes as follows:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total barrels of wine as follows:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Carl ate a sandwich every day this week. There are 7 days in a week, so he ate 7 sandwiches. Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese. So, for the sandwiches, he used:
\[ 7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 2 \text{ slices/sandwich} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

For breakfast, he ate an omelet 3 days a week. Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
So, for the omelets, he used:
\[ 3 \text{ omelets} \times 3 \text{ slices/omelet} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

For dinner, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.

Adding all the slices together:
\[ 14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, Carl used 31 slices of cheese."
"Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, she had a total of:

22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens is:

6 (bags) × 9 (pens per bag) = 54 blue pens

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens is:

2 (bags) × 6 (pens per bag) = 12 red pens

Now, to find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the original pens to the new pens:

32 (original pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

So, Janet has 98 pens now."
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score Brinley needs for all six tests to have an average of 93.
2. Determine the lowest score from the first five tests.
3. Calculate the total score Brinley needs from the first five tests and the sixth test, excluding the lowest score.
4. Find out what score she needs on the sixth test.

Step 1: Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93.
- An average of 93 over 6 tests means the total score should be \(93 \times 6 = 558\).

Step 2: Determine the lowest score from the first five tests.
- The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Step 3: Calculate the total score Brinley needs from the first five tests and the sixth test, excluding the lowest score.
- The total score from the first five tests is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).
- Since we are removing the lowest score (71), we need the total of the remaining four scores plus the sixth score to be 558.
- So, \(438 - 71 + x = 558\), where \(x\) is the score on the sixth test.

Step 4: Find out what score she needs on the sixth test.
- Simplify the equation: \(367 + x = 558\).
- Solve for \(x\): \(x = 558 - 367 = 191\).

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

Final numerical answer:
191"
"Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks. So, for the first part, we calculate:

5 times a week * 25 kilometers each time * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Then, he changed his routine and rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks. So, for the second part, we calculate:

2 times a week * 60 kilometers each time * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the two parts together to find the total kilometers:

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

So, Micheal did a total of 860 kilometers."
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g (because 40g ÷ 2 = 20g).

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars × 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples × 20g per candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

2600g"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find out how many cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought 76 cakes after all three days."
"First, let's find out the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates would cost:

\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = 6000 \times 6 = 36000 \]

Now, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800, we need to find the cost of one cup. First, let's find out how many cups are in twenty dozen:

\[ \text{Number of cups} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Now, to find the cost of one cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:

\[ \text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's find out how much Sara needs in total to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so that's $20 x 2 = $40.

So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Now, let's see how much Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so from babysitting, she earns $5 x 4 = $20.

Let's say Sara mows the lawn \(x\) times. She earns $4 each time, so from mowing the lawn, she earns $4x.

The total amount Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn is $20 + $4x.

We know she needs $60 more, so we set up the equation:
$20 + $4x = $60.

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
$4x = $60 - $20
$4x = $40
x = $40 ÷ $4
x = 10.

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of red chickens is \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs each day, so the total eggs from red chickens are \( 3R \).
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs each day, so the total eggs from white chickens are \( 5(R + 2) \).
5. The total number of eggs collected every day is 42, so we can write the equation: \( 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 32 / 8 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"First, we need to find out the total distance Gary walks around the park. The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides. 

The rectangle has two sides that are 1.5 miles long and two sides that are 6 miles long. So, the total distance is:

\[ 1.5 \, \text{miles} + 1.5 \, \text{miles} + 6 \, \text{miles} + 6 \, \text{miles} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \frac{15 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, she counted:
100 (from the first day) + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
500 (total by the third day) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250 customers.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Both pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute.
2. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool now has \( x \) gallons of water. Then, the big pool now has \( 4x \) gallons of water.

Since both pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( x + 4 \times 4 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( 4x + 4 \times 4 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 4x + 16 = 2(x + 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 4x + 16 = 2x + 32 \]
\[ 4x - 2x = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2x = 16 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The small pool now has 8 gallons of water."
"First, we need to find out how much money Lori needs in total. She wants to buy a pair of shoes that cost $320.00 and a belt that costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Now, we know Lori earns $8.00 for each hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. 

First, let's find out the total amount she promised to return:
- 10% of $2000 is $2000 * 10/100 = $200.
- So, the total amount to be returned is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months:
- Total payment over 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total payment from the total amount to be returned:
- Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase.

There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's find out the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack now.

1. Harriet is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \(68 \div 2 = 34\). So, Yuri scored \(34 + 10 = 44\) points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and she solved 3 crossword puzzles. So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:
10 minutes/puzzle × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Carmen spends 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle and she solved 8 sudoku puzzles. So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:
5 minutes/puzzle × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

To find the total time spent on both activities, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles:
30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"First, we need to find out how much water was left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. The tank originally had 120 liters.

So, the water left after Celine used some is:
120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Next, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
2 × 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater to the water left in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank now:
30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the final answer is:
90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

90 + 50 = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. To find a third, we divide $15000 by 3:

$15000 ÷ 3 = $5000

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amounts for each year:

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. So, Carlos pays:

They will pay $180 for their rentals altogether."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.
2. The question states that it takes half as many days to travel by car. So, we need to find half of 6 days.
3. Half of 6 days is \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days.

Now, we need to find out the total travel time if Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and returns by car.

4. The travel time to Rochester by bus is 6 days.
5. The travel time back from Rochester by car is 3 days.

To find the total travel time, we add the two times together:
\[6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days}\]

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days."
"First, let's find out how many water type cards James has after losing 8 of them. He originally has 40 water type cards, so after losing 8, he has:

40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

Next, let's find out the total number of cards James has after buying 14 more grass type cards. He originally has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 32 water type cards, so the total is:

30 + 20 + 32 = 82 cards

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. We do this by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

(32 / 82) * 100 = 38.66%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

"First, let's add up the cost of the burrito and the extra items Chad ordered:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the upgrade cost:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces, so her mom adds 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

120 watermelons * 30% = 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm is:

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest after the two weeks is:

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"First, we need to find out how much Mark pays for the cars before tax and registration. He buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, we multiply 12 by $20,000:

12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we need to calculate the tax. The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 10% (or 0.10):

$240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to find the total cost before registration:

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Then, we need to add the registration cost. The registration cost is $1,000 per car, and he has 12 cars. So, we multiply $1,000 by 12:

$1,000 * 12 = $12,000

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration:

$264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, the final amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."

Robert's shells: 20
Kylie's shells (Monday): 20 + 5 = 25

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. We know that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

Kylie's shells (Tuesday): 25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday."

Final numerical answer:
12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. His girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, so she eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes:
63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to grow enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"First, we need to find out how many slices are needed in total. John has 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices. So, we multiply 20 by 4:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so now he is pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike receives 6 * 5 = 30 pages of letters a week.

Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, we need to find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums. There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other. So, the difference is:

32 - 4 = 28

This difference (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, to find the number of fish, we divide the difference by 2:

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

14 fish in each aquarium."
"First, let's find out how many hours the makeup artist works each week. She works 6 hours a day and needs it done 4 times a week, so:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours she works for the movie is:

24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:

10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean paid $27,000."
"First, we need to find out how much Isabelle spent in total. We do this by adding up all the costs:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96.

Next, we need to split this cost evenly between Isabelle and her two parents. This means the cost is divided into 3 equal parts:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of one pound of onions is $1.50. So, the total cost for 200 pounds is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, Sue ate a total of \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories.

Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's find out how many students are in the school in total. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students, the total number of students is:
3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the number of boys in the school is:
50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the first and second classes:
First class: 15 girls
Second class: 12 girls
Total girls in the first and second classes: 15 + 12 = 27 girls

Since the school has 30 boys in total, and we know there are 27 girls in the first and second classes, we can find out how many girls are in the third class:
Total girls in the school - Girls in the first and second classes = Girls in the third class
30 - 27 = 3 girls in the third class

Since each class has 20 students, and the third class has 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:
20 students - 3 girls = 17 boys

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis started with 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61:

61 - 9 = 52

Then he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52:

52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

So, today he killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars, which means he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Wolves: 10 (from last night) + 36 (from today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (from last night) + 12 (from today) = 27 cougars

Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals

73"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor.

To find the floor he goes to, we need to do this calculation: 4 times his starting floor (which is 3) plus 6.

So, we do 4 × 3 = 12, and then add 6 to that.

12 + 6 = 18

Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30 times 30% and subtract that from 30.
30 times 30% is 30 * 0.30 = 9.
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.
21 * 4 = 84.

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, we need to find out how many cows Mr. Sylas adds to each stall. He bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 20 stalls. So, we divide 40 by 20:

40 ÷ 20 = 2

This means Mr. Sylas added 2 cows to each stall.

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows. After adding 2 more cows to each stall, each stall now has:

20 + 2 = 22 cows

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. So, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

22 × 8 = 176

So, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."
"First, let's count the money Brady has in each type of coin and bill.

1. Pennies: 100 pennies are worth 100 * $0.01 = $1.00
2. Nickels: 40 nickels are worth 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
3. Dimes: 20 dimes are worth 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
4. Dollar bills: 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add all the amounts together:

$1.00 (from pennies) + $2.00 (from nickels) + $2.00 (from dimes) + $40.00 (from dollar bills) = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

Final numerical answer:
$45.00"
"First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in the 200-foot tall redwood. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:

200 ÷ 10 = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it is:

20 sections × 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we know that termites ate 30% of the redwood. To find out how much weight was eaten, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

30% of 8000 = 0.30 × 8000 = 2400 pounds

So, the termites ate 2400 pounds of the redwood. To find out how much the redwood weighs now, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final numerical answer is:

5600 pounds"
"Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books. So, we first calculate the total amount for the books:

$0.50 × 8 = $4.00

Since at least one book is over a week overdue, she also has to pay a flat $2.00 fee.

Now, we add the amount for the books and the flat fee:

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Andrea has 52 apples.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has:
52 apples - 8 = 44 apples

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has:
44 apples + 4 = 48 bananas

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has:
48 bananas / 2 = 24 bananas

Now, let's count the total number of fruits:
Apples Andrea has: 52
Bananas Andrea has: 24
Apples Jamal has: 44
Bananas Jamal has: 48

Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168

168"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Carla is making in total. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add these numbers together:

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour she needs for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies. So, we need to find out how many dozens are in 66 cookies:

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5 dozens

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find out how many cups of flour are needed:

5.5 × 2 = 11 cups

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

11 cups"
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup.

To do this, we take the total number of pennies, which is 9,300, and multiply it by two thirds.

So, we calculate: \( 9,300 \times \frac{2}{3} \).

This is the same as: \( 9,300 \div 3 \times 2 \).

\( 9,300 \div 3 = 3,100 \).

Then, \( 3,100 \times 2 = 6,200 \).

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100 to find the dollar amount.

\( 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \).

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62 dollars."
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, let's count the total number of marbles in the boxes first:

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, we add those to the total:

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has and then add 5:

\[ 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final answer: 8"
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

Carmen's $100 + Samantha's $125 + Daisy's $175 = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

So, all three girls have $400 combined."
"First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price is $350,000.

To find 5% of $350,000, we do:
\[ 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

So, the brokerage fee is $17,500.

Next, we calculate the transfer fee. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. Again, the selling price is $350,000.

To find 12% of $350,000, we do:
\[ 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

So, the transfer fee is $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

The total price of the house is $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, we need to find out how much Mr. Tan paid for the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000.

To find 3% of $400,000, we do:
\[ 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 12,000 \]

So, the transfer fees are $12,000.

Next, we need to find out how much Mr. Tan paid for the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $400,000.

To find 5% of $400,000, we do:
\[ 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 20,000 \]

So, the brokerage fee is $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total amount paid for fees:
\[ 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price:
\[ 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat it to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes, we do:
\[ 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook the chicken. We know it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm the oil, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for newspaper ads is:
\[ 50 \text{ ads} \times \$5 \text{ per ad} = \$250 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for television ads is:
\[ 15 \text{ ads} \times \$75 \text{ per ad} = \$1125 \]

Now, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$250 + \$1125 = \$1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of \$1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler has 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so we have:

16 balls / 2 = 8 golf balls

Half of these golf balls are blue, so we have:

Final numerical answer:
4"
"The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has:
300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's find out how many windows are in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of bedroom windows is:

3 bedrooms/house × 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows/house

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows in both houses is:

6 windows/house × 2 houses = 12 windows

Now, let's add the additional windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

4 windows/house × 2 houses = 8 windows

To find the total number of windows, we add the bedroom windows and the additional windows together:

12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"First, we need to add up the cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cocoa costs $4.20, the laundry costs $9.45, and the pasta costs $1.35. 

Let's add these amounts together:

$4.20
+ $9.45
+ $1.35
---------
$15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00. To find out how much change she should get back, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

The cashier gives back $5.00."
"First, let's find out how many stitches the collar takes. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes. So, we divide 900 by 10:

900 ÷ 10 = 90 stitches for the collar.

Next, we find out how many stitches the rosette takes. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, we multiply the number of stitches for the collar by 2:

90 × 2 = 180 stitches for the rosette.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find out how many stitches are used for the sleeves by subtracting the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total:

1800 - 900 (body) - 90 (collar) - 180 (rosette) = 630 stitches for the sleeves.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes:

630 ÷ 2 = 315 stitches for each sleeve.

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together:
- Total cost = cost of tomato seeds + cost of celery seeds
- Total cost = \(800 + 2400 = 3200\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is 3200 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many lines are in the first scene. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so:

\[ 54 \times 2 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so:

\[ \frac{108}{3} = 36 \text{ lines} \]

Next, let's find out how many lines are in the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so:

\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize. He has to memorize 54 lines from the solo song, 36 lines from the first scene, and 48 lines from the second scene. So, the total number of lines is:

\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

Now, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole. So for 30 small holes, it will take:

3 minutes/hole × 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's find out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole. So for 15 large holes, it will take:

10 minutes/hole × 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 240 minutes into hours:

240 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

4 hours"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

To explain it simply:
- Right now, the sum of their ages is 20.
- In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will be 10 years older.
- So, we add 10 years to each of their current ages.
- That means we add 10 + 10 = 20 to their current age sum.
- Therefore, 20 (current sum) + 20 (added years) = 30.

Final numerical answer:
30"
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
2. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

Now, in 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is 6 years old."
"Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, the cost for the popsicles is:
20 × $0.25 = $5.00

He also bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, the cost for the ice cream bars is:
4 × $0.50 = $2.00

To find the total amount he paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

Peter paid a total of $7.00."
"First, we need to find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

So, a mamba has:
70 spots / 2 = 35 spots

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots, so:
40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots, so:
60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots

Now, we add the total number of spots for cobras and mambas to get the combined total:
2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined:
4900 spots / 2 = 2450

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is 2450."
"First, let's find out how many people will be at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 team members + (12 team members * 2 guests) = 12 + 24 = 36 people from the team members and their guests. Adding the 3 coaches, we have 36 + 3 = 39 people in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"First, we need to figure out how much space the topaz gemstones take up in the necklace. Since each topaz gemstone is one inch long and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, the total length taken by the topaz gemstones is:

8 topaz gemstones * 1 inch per topaz = 8 inches

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the space left for the sterling silver beads is:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses, we divide the remaining length by the length of one sterling silver bead:

17 inches / (1/4 inch per bead) = 17 * 4 = 68 beads

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled that number, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote:

Alani's stories: 40 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 80 stories
Braylen's stories: 80 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 160 stories
Margot's stories: 120 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 240 stories

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is:

80 (Alani) + 160 (Braylen) + 240 (Margot) = 480 stories

Final numerical answer:
480"
"Ann's brother is twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is 9 x 2 = 18 years old.

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's find out how much money Kelly has in total:
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, Kelly has \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we subtract that from her total:
\(145 - 55 = 90\) cents.

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"First, let's count the stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are in these five rows:
\(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the stars we already counted from the total number of stars:
\(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

Now, we need to find out how many rows of 5 stars make up these 40 stars. We do this by dividing the number of stars by 5:
\(40 \div 5 = 8\)

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.

So, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
75 pounds/flagstone × 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds if each truck can carry 2000 pounds.

So, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:
6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, so it's going at 30 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Ali has 22 medals.
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
They have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means the total medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390 medals.

"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, we have:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she pauses for half an hour, so she actually works for 2.5 hours.

First, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 2.5 hours.

1 hour = 60 minutes
2.5 hours = 2.5 × 60 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes she works by 10 minutes to find the number of intervals:
150 minutes ÷ 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, so:
15 intervals × $5 = $75

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's find out how many points each player has before the extra points are given.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's see who gets the extra point in the fourth round. The rule is that players with over 20 points get an extra point.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to their totals.

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, let's add up all the points to find the total.

Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points is 83."
"Will's oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 4 years old and washes 4 oranges. 

In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges. 

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 x 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up all the activities for both days:

First day total:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Second day total:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Adding all these together:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"Each person eats rice twice a day, so each person eats 0.2 kg x 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.
There are 5 members in the household, so they eat 0.4 kg x 5 = 2 kg of rice per day.
A 42 kg bag of rice will last 42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days.
Since there are 7 days in a week, the rice will last 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

"Sam's target was to sell 120 crates of bread in a week.

Let's add up the crates he sold from Tuesday to Friday:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend: 20 crates

Now, let's sum these up:
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so we need to find out how many crates he was off by:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"Carmen starts by accepting the opening bid of $200. Each bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who each bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them.

First, let's calculate the total increase in the bid after each of the 3 other people bid:
- First other person's bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second other person's bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third other person's bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her final bid is:
- Carmen's bid: $350 + $50 = $400

So, the desk costs Carmen $400."
"First, let's find out how many miles John drives each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home. So, each day he drives:

30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles

Now, let's calculate how many miles he drives in a week. He goes to work 5 days a week, so:

60 miles/day × 5 days/week = 300 miles/week

Next, we'll find out how many miles he drives in a year. He works 50 weeks a year, so:

300 miles/week × 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate how much he pays for the miles driven in a year. He gets charged $2 per mile, so:

15,000 miles/year × $2/mile = $30,000/year

Finally, let's calculate the yearly bonus. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:

$150/month × 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Now, we add the cost of the miles driven and the yearly bonus to find the total cost:

$30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year

So, John pays $31,800 a year for driving."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 

So, we add these two amounts together:
16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. So, we need to multiply the total minutes from Monday and Sunday by 2:
39 × 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, we need to think about how the pages are printed on the paper. When we fold a piece of paper in half, we get two pages on the front and two pages on the back. So, for every piece of paper, we can print 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

To find out how many pieces of paper we need for 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages we can print on one piece of paper:

32 pages ÷ 4 pages per piece of paper = 8 pieces of paper

So, we would use 8 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid."
"Annika brought $50 to the town fair.

First, she spent half of it on food and snacks. Half of $50 is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides.

To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she brought:
\[ 50 - 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Annika has $15 left."
"Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since she sold 45 books this year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

There are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\) books.

We know she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 90 - 45 = 65\) books.

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(65 \times 20 = 1300\) dollars.

"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week. So, in a week, he works:

10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

He earns $10 per hour, so in a week, he earns:

50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well, he gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total earnings for a week are:

$500 (wages) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week

April typically has 4 weeks. So, his total earnings for April are:

"John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles.

First, we find out how many people he beats:
80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16 people

So, John beats 16 people.

To find out how many people he loses to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestles:

"First, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

To find two-thirds of 60, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the morning sales from the total production:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Now, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon are half of the remaining loaves, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ 10 \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. So, in 4 weeks, Sandy will lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we divide the total weight by the weight lost per week for Sandy.

So, 8 ÷ 2 = 4 weeks.

Sandy will lose 8 pounds in 4 weeks."
"First, let's find out how much you save on one tub of ice cream. The original price is $13 and it is now sold at $11. So, the savings per tub of ice cream is:

$13 - $11 = $2

Now, if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings would be:

$2 × 2 = $4

Next, let's find out how much you save on one packet of milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. So, if you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings would be:

$0.5 × 4 = $2

Now, to find out the total savings, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

$4 + $2 = $6

So, if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, you will save $6."
"To find out how many new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to count how many extra arms and legs they will get.

First, let's count the extra arms:
- An extra arm is grown every 3 days.
- In 15 days, we divide 15 by 3: 15 ÷ 3 = 5.
- So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, let's count the extra legs:
- An extra leg is grown every 5 days.
- In 15 days, we divide 15 by 5: 15 ÷ 5 = 3.
- So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the extra arms and legs together:
- Extra arms: 5
- Extra legs: 3
- Total new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8

So, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost for the suitcases is:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's find the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
So, the cost of the flight ticket is:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he wants to spend on the trip is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

The amount Theo has left to spend on gifts is the total amount he wants to spend minus the amount already spent:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{2050}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's figure out how many eggs the family eats in one day.

In the family, 3 people eat 3 eggs each, so that's:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat 2 eggs each, so that's:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

So, in one day, the family eats:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Now, to find out how many eggs they eat in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Quinn is 30 years old.

Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is:

Trent is 32 years old."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.
4. Six years ago, Noah's age was 20, so now Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.
5. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, the population six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
6. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

Now, we know the total number of players is 105. So, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, there are 30 players on the defense."
"First, let's find out how many people Martha invited in total.

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's:
2 families * 6 people/family = 12 people

She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's:
3 families * 4 people/family = 12 people

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
12 people + 12 people = 24 people

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract these from the total number of people invited:
24 people - 8 people = 16 people

Now, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:
1/4 * 8 people = 2 people

These 2 people who had previous commitments are not part of the 8 who couldn't come, so we don't subtract them from the 16 people who were expected to come.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
16 people

"Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to the store. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles Solomon has now is:

20 (bought from Johanna) + 50 (already in the store) = 70 marbles

Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, the number of marbles given by his father is:

2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles

Now, adding the marbles given by his father to the total number of marbles Solomon has:

70 (Solomon's marbles) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles

Each marble weighs 2kgs. So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:

78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156kgs

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to find out how many cubic feet of water the pool can hold. To do this, we multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

The length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 5 feet.

So, the volume of the pool is:
6 feet * 4 feet * 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

Now, it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot.

So, the total cost is:
120 cubic feet * $0.1 per cubic foot = $12

The final numerical answer is:

"The classroom has 30 boys.

If there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then there are:
3 * 30 = 90 girls.

If there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then there are:
1/10 * 30 = 3 nongendered children.

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 123 children.

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

If there are 45 electric wires, we can find out how many sets of the ratio (1 pole and 3 wires) there are by dividing the number of wires by 3.

45 ÷ 3 = 15

This means there are 15 sets of the ratio. Since each set includes 1 pole, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

Total number of electric poles required: 15"
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 people.

This means 40 - 10 = 30 people stayed at the party.

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. So, the number of women who stayed can be found by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed.

So, the number of women who stayed is 30 - 22 = 8 women.

"The book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"First, we need to find out how many pencils Jam has in total. Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together make 26 pencils.

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 26.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils Meg has. According to the problem, Meg has 46 pencils.

Now, we need to find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. We do this by adding the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has:

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that Jam's three boxes already contain pencils, we can assume that each box can hold the same number of pencils. We know that 3 boxes plus 2 loose pencils make 26 pencils. So, each box holds:

26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils

This means each box holds 24 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

72 pencils ÷ 24 pencils/box = 3 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils."
"First, we need to find out how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:

65 ÷ 13 = 5

So, Shannon uses 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, for 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes:

5 × 12 = 60 milliliters weaker

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream. The cream also weakens the coffee, so we add the weakening effect of the cream to the weakening effect of the ice cubes:

60 + 15 = 75

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade system. For every 2 old records, they get 1 new record.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they traded by multiplying the number of new records by 2 (since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record).

So, 7 new records * 2 old records per new record = 14 old records.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Now, we know each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers is:

Total paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the pay for each senior programmer is:

Pay for each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total paid to junior programmers and the total paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total paid to junior programmers + Total paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation \( x + 6 = 20 \). Subtract 6 from both sides: \( x = 20 - 6 \).

7. So, \( x = 14 \).

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

Final numerical answer: 14"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

1. He eats 2 on his way to school: 
   24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

2. He passes 14 out to his friends:
   22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

3. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends:
   He gave 14 to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.
   8 + 28 = 36 lollipops now.

4. He eats 3 more that night:
   36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

5. He eats 2 more in the morning:
   33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops."
"To fully charge the phone, we need to find out how many more percentage points of charge are needed and then calculate the time required.

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so it needs:
100% - 60% = 40% more charge

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. So, for 40 percentage points, it will take:
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours:
120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so she has:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has:

17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

Final numerical answer: 14"
"First, let's find out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off the next purchase. So, $80 divided by $20 is 4. This means they earned 4 rewards.

Now, on this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The rewards they have are worth $4, so they subtract $4 from $43. This gives them $43 - $4 = $39.

But they also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are worth $4, twice that amount is $4 * 2 = $8.

So, we subtract the $8 from the $39. This gives $39 - $8 = $31.

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. So, the annual pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state has a 20% tax rate. So, the tax on Job A is:
\[ 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year. The state charges $6,000 in property tax, so the pay after property tax is:
\[ 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state has a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. So, the tax on Job B is:
\[ 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \text{ dollars} \]

The net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs. Job B has a higher net pay than Job A. The difference in net pay is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with a higher net pay rate, which is Job B.

Final answer:
\[ 8,400 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. To find 40 percent of 220, we multiply 220 by 40 percent (or 0.40).

220 * 0.40 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we take half of 88.

88 * 0.5 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 months * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 months * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the difference between the two offers:
- Difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, we need to find out how many paintball guns they have in total. We do this by adding the number of guns each person has:

DJ has 8 guns.
Nick has 10 guns.
RJ (Richard) has 1 gun.
Richard has 5 guns.

So, the total number of guns is:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 ÷ 4 = 6 guns.

So, if they share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns."
"Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers. For 8 batches, he will need:

30 ounces/batch × 8 batches = 240 ounces

For 1 batch of fudge, he needs 70 ounces of sugar.

240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces

Final numerical answer:
310 ounces"
"First, let's find out how much Maria's shares are worth after the first year.

Maria bought 8 shares at $8 each, so the total cost was:
8 shares * $8/share = $64

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. So, the new price per share is:
$8 * 1.50 = $12

Now, let's find out the total value of the shares after the first year:
8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share is:
$12 * 0.75 = $9

Now, let's find out the total value of the shares after the second year:
8 shares * $9/share = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:
John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:
\(3 - 2 = 1\)

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. We know the class has 200 students.
2. The class is split into 3 groups.
3. Two of these groups have the same number of students.
4. The third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two equal groups has \( x \) students. Then the smallest group would have \( x - 10 \) students.

So, the total number of students in all three groups is:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students, would have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \). Then the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can write:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows and \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} + 40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} \]
\[ = 80 + 80 \]
\[ = 160 \]

The animals have 160 legs all together."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

So, at the end of the fourth week, Josh is juggling 6 balls. When he drops 3 balls, he loses 1 completely. So, he has:

6 - 3 - 1 = 2 balls left.

Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls."
"The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is 24 x 2 = 48 baby outfits.
Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Laurel has 87 baby outfits."
"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. 

First, we find 1/5 of 5000 meters:
5000 meters / 5 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters:
5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

So, Tyson will run 6000 meters every day if he follows his coach's advice.

June has 30 days. To find the total distance Tyson runs in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:
6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters

The total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."
"Juice Box A is 4 dollars.

Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:
11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then add the results together.

First, we calculate the legs from the 4-legged tables:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we calculate the legs from the 3-legged tables:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Jenny's son eats in a week. He gets 4 cookies 5 days a week, so:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. He eats 1 cookie every day for 7 days, so:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies eaten by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are eaten by them in total:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Jenny buys 36 cookies each week. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, we need to find the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, it would be:

2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60:

40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

This $24 is the amount of money that Davos saved with the discount. To find out how much he paid, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:

$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, we need to find out how much money the factory made per day when they were making tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, the total money made per day from tractors is:

10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, let's find out how much money they make per day now that they are making silos. They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, the total money made per day from silos is:

5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

To find out what percentage more they are making now, we need to calculate the difference in money made and then find out what percentage this difference is of the original amount (money made from tractors).

The difference in money made is:

$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

Now, to find out what percentage this difference is of the original amount:

($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

10%"
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first and then multiply it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, the monthly food cost is $25 * 4 = $100.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs, we get $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.
   - So, $220 * 12 = $2640.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"Peyton's activities are as follows:

- Monday: 1 hour of yoga
- Tuesday: 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hour of cheese-tasting
- Thursday: Half the time of the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours of errands

Now, let's add all the hours together:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 8 hours

So, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take 8 hours."
"April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. For the roses, she needs twice as many as for the daisies, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots.

So, in total, she needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April had 100 plant pots. After giving away 90 plant pots, she has 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over.

"Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. So, let's add up what she spent and gave away:

$11 (sweater) + $4 (brother) = $15

Now, we subtract what she spent and gave away from the amount she started with:

$36 (starting amount) - $15 (spent and given) = $21

So, Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's find out how much time John spent swimming. He spent half the time he spent boating swimming, so:

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long:

Show time: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Now, let's add up the time he spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:

Total time on activities: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up a simple equation:

15 hours = 30% of total time
15 hours = 0.30 * total time

To find the total time, we divide both sides by 0.30:

Total time = 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his time was spent sightseeing. To find out how much time that is, we calculate 40% of the total time:

Sightseeing time = 40% of 50 hours
Sightseeing time = 0.40 * 50 hours = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, the money from her first job is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, the money from her second job is:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job. She already has $80 in her savings. So, the total amount of money she has now is:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money she needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so:
17 feet × 2 = 34 feet

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"First, let's find out how much Dean spent on the toy cars. He bought 6 toy cars and each toy car cost $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
6 toy cars * $2/toy car = $12

Next, let's find out how much Dean spent on the teddy bears. He bought 5 teddy bears and each teddy bear cost $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 teddy bears * $1/teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find out the total amount Dean spent:
$12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17

Dean's mother gave him $28 initially. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:
$28 - $17 = $11

Then, his mother gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
$11 + $10 = $21

"Morgan needs to spend money on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. Let's break it down:

1. **Mini-golf**: $5 per person (including Morgan).
2. **Arcade tokens**: $5 for all.
3. **Go-karts**: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so $10 x 2 = $20 per person.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per person:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $20

Total cost per person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan has $90 to spend. We need to find out how many friends she can invite. Let's subtract the cost for Morgan herself from the total budget:
- Cost for Morgan = $30
- Remaining budget = $90 - $30 = $60

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
- Number of friends = $60 / $30 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Marisa gets $5 every day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. So, the total cost of lollipops each day is:

4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents

Since 100 cents is equal to $1, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops. 

Now, we need to find out how much she saves each day. She gets $5 and spends $1, so:

$5 - $1 = $4

This means Marisa saves $4 each day. If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4/day * 5 days = $20

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank after 5 days."
"First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, we can calculate the total cost of the gumballs as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05 \text{ per gumball} = \$2 \]

This means Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had after buying candy must be $4 (because $2 is half of $4).

Now, let's find out how much money Billy spent on candy. He started with $10 and had $4 left after buying candy, so he spent:

\[ \$10 - \$4 = \$6 \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Carver is 45 years old.
2. We know that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age.
3. If we let his son's age be \( x \), then twice his son's age would be \( 2x \).
4. According to the problem, Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than \( 2x \). So, we can write the equation: \( 2x - 5 = 45 \).
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, add 5 to both sides: \( 2x = 50 \).
6. Now, divide both sides by 2: \( x = 25 \).

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's find out the total distance the train travels between the three cities in one trip.

1. From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. From the third city back to the first city: 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles

So, the total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:

18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days

So, the train goes 20 days between services."
"First, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. To find the average, we add these two amounts and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

For 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total:
\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

23"
"First, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and he drives at 70 mph. To find the time, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to get to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the detour. The detour added 10 miles, so the total distance to his friend's house is now:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time to travel this distance is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it took for John to return home. The distance is 240 miles and he drives at 80 mph. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys are at Small Tree School in total. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders to find the number of boys:

96 (total fourth-graders) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys)

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. To find out how many boys were at school, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:

53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49 (boys at school on Friday)

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"There are 6 girls in the park.

If there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 x 2 = 12 boys in the park.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together:

6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids

Final numerical answer:
18"
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we need to add the points she already has and see how many more she needs to reach at least 42 points.

Jane's score on the first test is 15 points.
Jane's score on the second test is 18 points.

First, we add these two scores:
15 + 18 = 33 points

Now, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach at least 42 points:
42 - 33 = 9 points

So, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that four times the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5 equals the number of shoplifters. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

Number of shoplifters = 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, we calculate it as:

Number of people for physical violence = 3 * 7 = 21

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can find out how many were kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out:

Number of people for other reasons = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons."
"Sara scored 8 points. Erin now has three times more points than Sara, so Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points now. 

Before scoring 14 points, Erin had 24 - 14 = 10 points.

"First, let's find out the cost of the picture frames for all seniors. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors.

Total cost for picture frames = 44 seniors * $20/senior = $880

Next, we need to calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each frame. The etching cost is 20% of the frame's price.

Etching cost per frame = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Total etching cost for all frames = 44 seniors * $4/senior = $176

Now, let's calculate the cost for the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5.

Total cost for pins = 2 seniors * $5/senior = $10

Next, we need to find out how many seniors are officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, we calculate:

Number of officers = 1/4 * 44 seniors = 11 seniors

Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.

Total cost for cords = 11 seniors * $12/senior = $132

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts.

Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Etching cost + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,208

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,208."
"The wallpaper costs $400 at the market. If Ethan makes it himself, he saves 20% on the cost.

To find out how much he saves, we calculate 20% of $400:
20% of $400 = 0.20 × $400 = $80

So, by making it himself, Ethan saves $80.

To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original price:
$400 - $80 = $320

The total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
14 pairs * 2 = 28 pairs

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract these from the total:
14 pairs - 6 pairs = 8 pairs

Now, we add up all the pairs sold over the three days:
14 pairs (Friday) + 28 pairs (Saturday) + 8 pairs (Sunday) = 50 pairs

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs.

50 pairs"
"Hallie had dance practice on Tuesdays for 1 hour.
On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
On Saturdays, her practice was twice as long as on Tuesdays, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

To find out how many hours she had dance practice in a week, we add up all the hours:
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice each week."
"First, we need to find out how much worth of equipment was faulty. The faulty pieces are 40% of the total $400000.

To find 40% of $400000, we do:
\[ 400000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 400000 \times 0.4 = 160000 \]

So, the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160000.

Now, to find the value of the functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value:
\[ 400000 - 160000 = 240000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give 1 kg of milk each day. So, 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

The other half, also 15 sheep, give 2 kg of milk each day. So, 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

To find the total milk collected every day, we add the two amounts together: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She fed 1 roll to each of her 6 children, so she used 6 rolls for her children. That leaves 12 - 6 = 6 rolls.

Each of the remaining 6 rolls was broken into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

48 pieces"
"First, we find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after those who like blue are accounted for:

40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

40 pupils - 20 pupils (blue) - 5 pupils (green) = 15 pupils like yellow.

So, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"Lucy sold the apples for $4 each and got $56 from Monday's sales. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide the total money by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so:

\[ \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day:

\[ \text{Total apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked 50 apples over the three days."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, in total, she washed 20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks. 

To find out how many socks Lindsay missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks. So, 50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks.

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel started with 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 more. So, let's add those numbers together:

23 + 42 = 65

Now, Rachel's brother ate 44 cookies. To find out how many are left, we need to subtract 44 from the total number of cookies:

65 - 44 = 21

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she has to pay back, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10%, and the principal amount is $3,650.

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
Interest = $3,650 × 10% × (5/12) (since the time is 5 months, we convert it to a fraction of a year)

Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × (5/12)
Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × 0.4167 (approximating 5/12)
Interest = $3,650 × 0.04167
Interest = $152.08 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid back.

Total amount = Principal + Interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $152.08
Total amount = $3,802.08

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find out how much Karan has to pay per month.

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5
Monthly payment = $760.42 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:
14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:
9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's add up all the silver and gold pesos they have together.

Axel's total:
\[ 50 \text{ (silver)} + 80 \text{ (gold)} = 130 \text{ pesos} \]

Anna's total:
\[ 100 \text{ (silver)} + 120 \text{ (gold)} = 220 \text{ pesos} \]

Together, they have:
\[ 130 + 220 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

"First, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:

3 pitchers * 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups

Next, we need to find out how much money Millie makes from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

36 cups * $1 per cup = $36

Now, we need to find out how much it costs Millie to make the lemonade. She spends $18 on supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the money made:

$36 - $18 = $18

This is the total profit from selling all the lemonade. Now, we need to find out how much profit she makes per hour. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Since each cup is sold for $1, she makes $4 per hour from selling lemonade. But we need to subtract the cost per hour. The cost per hour is the total cost divided by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups and sells 4 cups per hour, it takes her:

36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours

So, the cost per hour is:

$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

Now, we subtract the cost per hour from the money made per hour:

$4 per hour - $2 per hour = $2 per hour

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

$2 per hour"
"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left. This 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 hectare is worth in terms of his total land. We can do this by dividing 12.8 hectares by 2 and then multiplying by 5.

First, we find out what 1/5 of his land is:
12.8 hectares ÷ 2 = 6.4 hectares

Now, to find out what 1 hectare (which is 1/5 of his total land) is worth, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5:
6.4 hectares × 5 = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can divide the total number of members by 2.

Total members = 52
Boys = 52 / 2 = 26
Girls = 52 / 2 = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so 26 girls are initially planning to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it. So, we need to find half of the 26 girls:

26 / 2 = 13 girls can't make it.

Now, we need to find out how many girls are actually performing:

26 - 13 = 13 girls are performing.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

13 + 3 = 16

So, 16 people sang in the performance."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add the scores:
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
400 ÷ 5 = 80

Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.
- So, the total cost for the erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.
- So, the total cost for the pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- The total cost is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we need to calculate 1/3 of 66. 

1/3 of 66 is 66 divided by 3, which equals 22.

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together:

66 (to Ms. Thompson) + 22 (to Mr. Yu) = 88

James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"First, let's figure out how much it costs for David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides using tickets.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, for one ride, the cost is:
2 tickets * $2 per ticket = $4

Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for 9 rides using tickets is:
9 rides * $4 per ride = $36

Now, let's see how much it costs for David to use the ride bracelet. The bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides, so:
Cost for David using the bracelet = $30

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the bracelet from the cost of buying tickets:
$36 (cost of tickets) - $30 (cost of bracelet) = $6

So, David saves $6."
"First, we need to find out how many gifts Monica is wrapping in total. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, we add these numbers together:

6 (family gifts) + 4 (friend gifts) + 2 (teacher gifts) = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this, we first need to understand how the popsicles are divided between Betty and Sam based on the ratio 5:6.

The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, each part of the ratio represents 165 ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

15"
"First, let's find out how much Tim pays for Netflix each month. Netflix costs $10 a month.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount. Normally, each service costs $10 a month. Since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to find 20% of $10 and then subtract that from $10.

20% of $10 is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]

So, the cost after the discount for each service is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Since he gets both Hulu and Disney Plus, we need to add the costs of both services:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Tim's total monthly cost for the streaming services is $26. His original cable package cost $60 a month. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package and getting the streaming services."
"Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Half of that time is 2 hours recording it. She spends 90 minutes editing, which is 1.5 hours (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours).

First, we need to find the total time she spent on all tasks:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total time she spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours out of the total 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"First, we need to find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so we can calculate the total number of books it can hold by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that can fit in the system. To find double the number of books, we multiply the total capacity by 2.

36 books * 2 = 72 books

Next, we add 20 more books to this number.

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92 books"
"Erica started with 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. Now, Erica has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards. She also received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica now has, we subtract the cards she gave away and add the cards she received:

50 (initial total) - 29 (given away) + 17 (received) = 38 cards.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's see how many slices Jenny gives to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices and she gives 1/3 to Bill, we calculate:

12 slices * 1/3 = 4 slices

Next, we find out how many slices Mark gets. Since he gets 1/4 of the pizza, we calculate:

12 slices * 1/4 = 3 slices

Now, we know Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the ones Jenny ate from the total number of slices:

12 slices - 4 slices (Bill) - 3 slices (Mark) - 2 slices (Jenny) = 3 slices

So, the final number of slices left is 3."
"Mark needs $300 to buy a bike. He already has $50 in his bank account. So, he needs to save an additional $300 - $50 = $250. 

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save $250, we divide $250 by $10.

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days

Mark has to save for 25 days."
"Nancy saw 90 spiders.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the spiders, so:
\[ \text{Millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so:
\[ \text{Stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

To find the total number of bugs, we add the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:
\[ \text{Total bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs."
"First, let's find out Beth's age. Since Erica is 30 years old and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can find Beth's age by adding 5 to Erica's age.

So, Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, let's find out Alice's age. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we add 7 to Beth's age to find Alice's age.

So, Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age.

Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk. Each glass is 8 ounces. So, he drinks 2 x 8 = 16 ounces of milk.

Final numerical answer: 48 calories"
"The builder works for 4 weeks every month and for 6 days every week. So, in one month, he works for 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days.

He gets paid $50 every day. So, in one month, he earns 24 days * $50/day = $1200.

There are 12 months in a year. So, in a year, he earns 12 months * $1200/month = $14400.

Final numerical answer: $14400"
"First, we need to find out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups × 4 = 12 cups

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup × 4 = 4 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups ÷ 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

For milk:
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups ÷ 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

- More bags of flour: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk."
"First, we need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses per day before Mel reduces the time. The air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, the energy used per day is:
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy used per day to kilowatt-hours:
7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day

The energy used per day after the reduction is:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

Converting this to kilowatt-hours:
2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatt-hours

The energy saved per day is:
7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days."
"First, let's count the stripes on each zebra:

- Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, for these two zebras, the total number of stripes is \(17 + 17 = 34\).
- There is a zebra with 36 stripes.
- There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. Half of 36 is \(36 \div 2 = 18\).

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
- The first two zebras have 34 stripes.
- The zebra with 36 stripes adds 36 more.
- The zebra with 18 stripes adds 18 more.

So, the total number of stripes is \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\).

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22."
"To make enough sandwiches for 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.

So, for 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, it will be 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, it will be 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese will be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Allan has 40 cannolis in his house. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 140 = 240.

240"
"Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he did 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he had done before the jog were 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he had already taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before the jog.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had done before the jog from the total steps he had taken before he had 2,000 steps left. So, 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. So, we multiply 45 by 200:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. So, he will leave:

60 minutes - 30 minutes = 30 minutes

But we also need to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport:

30 minutes - 10 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid in May.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour.

So, the weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600 \]

Since the employees worked for the whole month of May, the total pay for one employee in May is $600. For 40 employees, the total pay is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$24,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid in June.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

This means that the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

Each of these 30 employees worked 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for one employee in June is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600 \]

For 30 employees, the total pay in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$18,000 \]

Now, we add the total amount paid in May and June to get the total amount paid in the two months:
\[ \$24,000 + \$18,000 = \$42,000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \$42,000 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much the taffy costs. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, so it costs $3 divided by 2, which is $1.50. So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the seashell bag costs $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is 4 times $0.25, which is $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10. If she spent $7.00, then the money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, Sally has $3.00 left."
"Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400. Another pack is worth twice that much, so it's $400 * 2 = $800. 

The total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

He gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. A 20% discount on $1200 is $1200 * 20% = $1200 * 0.20 = $240. 

So, the discounted price for the two packs is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150. 

Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted fireworks, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. 

In 30 days, she will eat:
2 cookies/night × 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12 cookies) at a time, we need to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies.

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"First, we need to find out how many candles are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect, we need to find 5% of the total candles Marcy makes.

To find 5% of 50,000 candles:
5% of 50,000 = 0.05 × 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Now, since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, it means 1% of the candles might explode. We need to find 1% of the 2,500 more dangerous candles that have a defect.

To find 1% of 2,500:
1% of 2,500 = 0.01 × 2,500 = 25 candles

So, the final numerical answer is:
25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode."
"First, we need to find out the discount price of each blouse. The blouses are 30% off, so we need to calculate 30% of $20.

To find 30% of $20, we do:
\[ 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. Now, we subtract this discount from the regular price to find the sale price:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

So, each blouse costs $14 when it's on sale. Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's figure out how many apples Joanne and her sister gathered from the tallest and shortest trees.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many, so her sister gathered:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ apples} \]

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathered:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ apples} \]

Her sister gathered three times as many from the shortest trees, so she gathered:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ apples} \]

Now, let's add up the apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees by both Joanne and her sister:
- Joanne: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) = 45 apples
- Her sister: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples

Together, they gathered:
\[ 45 + 105 = 150 \text{ apples} \]

Since the total number of apples gathered by both is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is:
\[ 500 - 150 = 350 \text{ apples} \]

Since Joanne's sister did not gather any apples from the average trees, all 350 apples must have been gathered by Joanne. So, Joanne gathered:
\[ 350 \text{ apples} \]

Final answer:
\[ 350 \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we know that each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump.
2. We also know that there are 180 heads in total, and each animal has one head.
3. So, there are 180 camels and dromedaries combined.
4. We also know that there are 304 humps in total.

Let's use some simple math to find out how many dromedaries there are.

If we let the number of camels be \( C \) and the number of dromedaries be \( D \), we can write two equations based on the information given:

- The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
- The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

Now, we can solve these equations. First, we can use the first equation to express \( C \) in terms of \( D \):

\( C = 180 - D \)

Now, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:

\( 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \)

This simplifies to:

\( 360 - 2D + D = 304 \)

Which further simplifies to:

\( 360 - D = 304 \)

Now, we solve for \( D \):

\( D = 360 - 304 \)

\( D = 56 \)

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

Final numerical answer:
56"
"Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, the distance for the next two days is:
30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
0 kilometers

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is:
300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:
800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 0 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
3140 kilometers"
"Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker because Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's. So, we calculate Zack's locker size as follows:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker. So, we calculate Timothy's locker size as follows:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge below, which means the comb is now at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

So, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet."
"Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the money from both banks to his initial capital. He initially had $5000.

So, the total capital he has now is $5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank).

$5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. Since 4 boats each carried away 5 cats, we can calculate the total number of cats taken away by the boats as follows:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away by the boats from the original number of cats on the rock:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. We know that 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of 30:

(3/5) * 30 = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after a mouse from the remaining cats:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"First, let's break down the costs month by month.

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month.
   - So, for 6 months, the cost is \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

2. After the first 6 months, the cost is $12 per month for 8 months.
   - So, for 8 months, the cost is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) dollars.

3. After 14 months, the cost is $14 per month. Since we are calculating for 2 years (24 months), we need to find the cost for the remaining 10 months.
   - So, for 10 months, the cost is \(10 \times 14 = 140\) dollars.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost for 2 years.
- Total cost = \(48 + 96 + 140 = 284\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the savings from the jogger jeans is $6 / 3 = $2. This means the savings from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.

The original price of the jogger jeans would be the sale price plus the savings, which is $22 + $2 = $24.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $24.

The difference between the original cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $28 = -$4, but since we are asked how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we take the absolute value, which is $4.

Final numerical answer:
$4"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up all the capacities to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds = 60 birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds = 90 birds.

Adding the birds from both types of feeders, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day."
"First, let's find out how much the soup cost. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we calculate 25% of $4:

25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1

So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel. Therefore, the soup costs:

$4 (cost of the bagel) + $1 = $5

Next, we find out the cost of the cake. The cake is half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of $4:

Half of $4 = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find out the total cost of the dinner:

Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and he wants to have $50 in spending cash, so he needs to earn $150 in total from selling his cards.

Each card sells for $1.5, so we need to find out how many cards he needs to sell to make $150. We can do this by dividing $150 by $1.5:

$150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards

This means he needs to sell 100 cards to have enough money for the ticket and spending cash.

However, he keeps 1/3 of the cards for himself. This means that the 100 cards he sells represent 2/3 of his total collection because he keeps 1/3 and sells 2/3.

To find out how many cards he started with, we need to figure out what 100 cards represent as 2/3 of his total collection. We can do this by dividing 100 by 2 and then multiplying by 3:

100 ÷ 2 = 50
50 × 3 = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"The caterer was supposed to prepare for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18 guests who would get two hotdogs. That means 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, which is 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

The other half, which is also 18 guests, would get 1 hotdog each, which is 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs.

So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the first half) + 18 (for the second half) = 54 hotdogs.

But 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That means 40 guests would need 40 hotdogs for the first hotdog and another 40 for the second, totaling 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs needed.

Since only 54 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the difference between what was needed and what was prepared, which is 80 - 54 = 26 guests.

"First, let's add up all the items Charlotte wanted to buy:

- A set of pot and pans: $120.00
- A set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

This is the total cost before the discount. Now, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 20%, so we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"First, let's find out how much Dora needs in total to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The skipping rope costs $6.
The board game costs $11.
The playground ball costs $2.

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together:
$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

So, Dora needs $19 in total.

Now, let's see how much money Dora has.

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance.
Her mother gave her $16.

To find out how much money Dora has in total, we add these amounts together:
$2 + $16 = $18

Dora has $18 in total.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers. So, we divide 15 by 5:

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container

Now, we need to know how much gas Josey needs. She needs 1/4 of a container. So, we take the amount in one container (3 gallons) and multiply it by 1/4:

3 × 1/4 = 3/4 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, we multiply 3/4 by 8 to find out how many pints Josey needs:

3/4 × 8 = 6 pints

So, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent 1% of his money, which means he had 99% of his money left. Since he spent $5, we can calculate 1% of $5 to find out how much he spent on the chips.

1% of $5 is:
\[ \frac{1}{100} \times 5 = 0.05 \]

So, George spent $0.05 on the chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Now, let's check if the amount spent on chips matches the 1% of $5:
\[ 1.20 \neq 0.05 \]

It seems there was a misunderstanding. Let's correct it. If George spent $5 and 1% of his money is left, then 99% of his money was spent. So, the amount spent is:
\[ 5 \times 0.99 = 4.95 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

"First, let's find out how many pounds of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, so he needs 2 pounds x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The onions cost $2.00 a pound, so for 4 pounds, he will pay 4 pounds x $2.00/pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00/box = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of onions and beef stock: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. So, Bernadette's drive takes:
4 minutes (Wayne's drive) × 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's 4-minute drive time.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
4 minutes (Wayne's drive time) + 5 minutes = 9 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final numerical answer:
9 minutes"
"First, we need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this to find the width: Width = Area / Length.

So, the width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter of the room, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have: Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought a total of 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought a total of 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

Margareth has 140 beads and Elizabeth has 60 beads.

So, Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Final numerical answer:
80"
"Marcus starts with the house at 40 degrees.

First, he bakes for 3 hours. Each hour, the temperature goes up by 5 degrees. So, for 3 hours, the temperature increases by \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.

Starting from 40 degrees, after baking, the temperature is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The window cools the house by 2 degrees every 10 minutes. So, in 30 minutes, the temperature decreases by \(30 \div 10 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

Starting from 55 degrees, after opening the window, the temperature is \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"First, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James is 10% faster in the swim, so his swim time is:
40 minutes - (10% of 40 minutes) = 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike ride time is:
80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we know James's total time and his times for the swim and bike ride, so we can find out how long his run took:
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Swim time for James: 36 minutes
Bike ride time for James: 85 minutes

Run time for James: 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, we need to find out how long Movie C is. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1.25 hours to minutes by multiplying 1.25 by 60.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"First, we need to find out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH), we can calculate the distance as follows:

32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

So, the horse runs 16 miles in 30 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Now, we need to find out how much the hay costs. Since a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:

6 * $5 = $30

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:

$30 - $24 = $6

So, the change Michael has after buying the hay is $6."
"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 more eggs. 

First, let's find out how many eggs she has in total:
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs
- 4 dozen = 4 x 12 = 48 eggs
- Total eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. Rozanne wants to put out trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog.

First, let's find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make:
- Total eggs = 50
- Eggs needed per glass = 5
- Total glasses = 50 / 5 = 10 glasses

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we can find out how many trays she can put out:
- Total glasses = 10
- Glasses per tray = 5
- Number of trays = 10 / 5 = 2 trays

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"First, we need to find out how many points Joey has after his turn. Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 more points. So, we add 214 and 26:

214 + 26 = 240

Now, Marcy has 225 points and scores 10 more points. So, we add 225 and 10:

225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning. We do this by subtracting Marcy's total points from Joey's total points:

240 - 235 = 5

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's find out how much the salesman bought each sneaker for. He bought 48 sneakers for $576, so we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:

$576 ÷ 48 = $12 per sneaker.

Next, we calculate how much he made from the flash sale. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

17 × $20 = $340.

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were left after the flash sale:

48 - 17 = 31 sneakers.

He sold the rest of the sneakers to a department store for $25 each:

31 × $25 = $775.

Now, we add the money from the flash sale and the department store sales to find the total money made:

$340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the sneakers from the total money made:

$1115 - $576 = $539.

So, the salesman's profit is $539."
"First, let's count the crayons in the six packets that each had eight pieces. So, we have 6 packets * 8 pieces = 48 pieces.

Next, we count the crayons in the four packets that each had sixteen pieces. So, we have 4 packets * 16 pieces = 64 pieces.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total number of crayons. So, 48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"First, let's understand the costs:

1. Super ticket + popcorn + soda (with the super ticket) = $20 + $1 = $21
2. Regular ticket + popcorn + soda (without the super ticket) = $12 + $popcorn + $3

We know that by not buying the super ticket, you saved $2. So, the cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the cost of the super ticket plus popcorn and soda.

So, we have:
$12 + $popcorn + $3 = $21 + $2

Now, let's solve for the popcorn:
$12 + $popcorn + $3 = $23
$popcorn + $15 = $23
$popcorn = $23 - $15
$popcorn = $8

The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, we need to find out the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900. So, we divide $900 by 20 to find the cost per balloon.

$900 ÷ 20 = $45

This means each balloon cost $45 on the first day.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, we add $20 to the original cost of $45.

$45 + $20 = $65

This is the new cost per balloon after the price increase.

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 each.

$65 × 170 = $11,050

So, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second part, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's add the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's find the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.

First, let's find out how many sapphires she has left after the trade:
8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = 5 sapphires

Next, let's find out the value of the sapphires she has left:
5 sapphires × $800 per sapphire = $4000

Now, let's find out the value of the rubies she got from the trade:
2 rubies × $1200 per ruby = $2400

Finally, let's add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
$4000 + $2400 = $6400

The total value of all her jewels is $6400."
"Marin eats 4 apples a day. Nancy also eats 4 apples a day. Together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day. In 30 days, they will eat 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

"First, we need to find out how much soil Bob needs for all the raised beds. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. To find the volume of one raised bed, we multiply these dimensions together:

2 feet (width) × 8 feet (length) × 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one raised bed by 10:

32 cubic feet × 10 = 320 cubic feet

Now, we know that each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume of soil by the volume each bag can hold:

320 cubic feet ÷ 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

160 bags × $12 per bag = $1920

So, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. We know there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than red cards.

To find 60% of 15, we do:
\[ 15 \times \frac{60}{100} = 15 \times 0.6 = 9 \]

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is:
\[ 78 \]"
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies, so the total became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining fairies are:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

The final number of fairies remaining is:
45"
"First, let's count the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:

8 + 12 = 20 puppies

Next, let's count the number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:

3 + 4 = 7 puppies

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

( Number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies ) × 100

So, we have:

( 7 / 20 ) × 100 = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying.

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes, each 1 pound
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags, each 12 pounds
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds

3. **Hay**: 42 bales, each 75 pounds
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats**: 20 sacks, each 65 pounds
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number because even a fraction of a trip means an additional trip is needed.

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles cans and bottles each week. 

First, let's calculate how much she earns from recycling cans in one week:
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, from cans, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents a week.

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from recycling bottles in one week:
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, from bottles, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents a week.

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling in one week:
- From cans: 6 cents
- From bottles: 15 cents
- Total for one week: \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
- Total for four weeks: \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants.

To find 60% of Frederick's plants:
60% of 10 = 0.60 * 10 = 6

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 6
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7 = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, so she gave him $100 / 2 = $50.

"First, we need to find out what 1/5 of the pizza delivery cost is. The pizza delivery costs $15.

To find 1/5 of $15, we divide $15 by 5:
$15 ÷ 5 = $3

So, the tip Ashley wants to give is $3.

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount:
$15 (cost of pizza) + $3 (tip) = $18

The total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Finley started in first place. She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. Then she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4th place. After falling behind 3 spots, she was in 7th place. Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish in 6th place.

Finley finished in 6th place."
"Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

She also has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Adding the basketball and baseball cards together, the total number of cards Miss Maria has is:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself. So, the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ 300 \div 10 = 30 \]

Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's find out how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * 45 cents = 900 cents

Becky received a $1 discount. Since $1 is 100 cents, the total cost after the discount is:
900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents

Now, let's find out how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * 50 cents = 1000 cents

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10 percent of 1000 cents:
10% of 1000 cents = 0.10 * 1000 cents = 100 cents

So, the total cost after the discount is:
1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky.

Kelly paid 900 cents and Becky paid 800 cents. The difference is:
900 cents - 800 cents = 100 cents

So, Kelly paid 100 cents more than Becky.

Final numerical answer: 100 cents"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the laundry pieces for one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, for one room, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of laundry there are in 80 rooms:
- 15 pieces per room x 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry.

Final numerical answer:

"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. 

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. 
So, he now has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. 
Now he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. 
Now he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. 
So, he now has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final numerical answer is 120 shoes."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply 8 by 6.

8 cupcakes/jar × 6 jars = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans worth of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold.

48 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how much the piece of paper cost. The pen cost $2. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it cost $6 - $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost. The total cost is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier. So, the change is $10 - $7 = $3.

The amount of change Theo received is $3."
"First, let's find out how many pencils were there at the start. There are 30 students and each started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the start is:

30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, we need to find out how many pencils that is:

1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils

This means 60 pencils were used, so we subtract this from the total number of pencils to find out how many are left:

300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, we need to find out how many pencils that is:

1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils

So, the final number of pencils left is:

80 pencils

80"
"Let's think about this step by step. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. So, the total length of the remoras is:

6 inches + 6 inches = 12 inches

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units the same. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Now, we need to find what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length. We do this by dividing the total length of the remoras by the shark's body length and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

(12 inches / 120 inches) × 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. We know that three-fourths of the students have desktop computers.
2. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers.
3. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

If one-fourth of the students is 20, then to find the total number of students, we need to multiply 20 by 4.

So, 20 x 4 = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level."
"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we first need to figure out how many days he will be walking in three weeks.

Three weeks have 3 times 7 days, which is 21 days.

Jason can walk 4 days a week. In three weeks, he can walk 4 days times 3 weeks, which is 12 days.

Now, we know that he needs to walk for 240 minutes in total to break in his shoes. To find out how long he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he will be walking.

So, 240 minutes divided by 12 days equals 20 minutes per day.

Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book cost $15. To find out how many books she bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book:

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Sarah gave an equal number of these 20 books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per child

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the things.

1. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. But, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. If we just add 9 and 6, we would be counting those 3 kids twice. So, we need to subtract those 3 kids from the total.

2. So, the number of kids allergic to at least one of these is \(9 + 6 - 3 = 12\).

3. There are 32 kids in total. If 12 of them are allergic to at least one of these things, then the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is \(32 - 12 = 20\).

So, the final answer is 20 kids aren't allergic to anything."
"There are 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 employees. So, the total number of employees is:

3 groups × 200 employees/group = 600 employees

Each group also has 7 tour guides. So, the total number of tour guides is:

3 groups × 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides

To find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees and the number of tour guides:

600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people

So, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's find out how much the hotel costs during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it's 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

To find 20% of $1500, we do:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the hotel costs $300 more during the busy weekend. Now, we add this to the normal price:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

This is the cost per day for the hotel during the busy weekend. Since they stay for 3 days, we multiply this by 3:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two of them, we multiply by 2:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400."
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben:
- Half of 4 is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben:
- Three times 3 is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has:
- 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11 tubes of paint.

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we need to find three-quarters of 48 grains.

To find three-quarters of 48, we can do:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:
\[ 48 + 36 = 84 \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"Keegan and Tashay needed to raise $200 in total.

Keegan earned $83.
Tashay earned $91.

To find out how much they earned together, we add Keegan's and Tashay's earnings:
$83 + $91 = $174

Now, to find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:
$200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Gabriel has 20 songs, so:

Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 × 20
Luri's songs = 60

Now, let's see how many songs each can still add to their players. Each player can hold up to 100 songs.

Gabriel can add:
100 - Gabriel's songs
100 - 20
= 80 songs

Luri can add:
100 - Luri's songs
100 - 60
= 40 songs

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

Gabriel's capacity - Luri's capacity
80 - 40
= 40 songs

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked.

To find 2/5 of 60, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats, we need to find out how much money he gave up for 24 oranges.

To find the total amount of money, we do:
\[ 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"First, we need to find out how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we multiply $80 by 3:

$80 * 3 = $240

Now, we know that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than this amount. So, we subtract $20 from $240:

$240 - $20 = $220

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days. So, he runs a total of:

12 miles/day * 5 days = 60 miles/week

If he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, then the time he spends running each day is:

12 miles / 10 miles/hour = 1.2 hours/day

So, the total time he spends running in a week is:

1.2 hours/day * 5 days = 6 hours/week

James runs 6 hours a week."
"First, let's find out how much oats one horse eats in one day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day

Now, Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total amount of oats the horses eat in one day is:

10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day

Next, we need to find out how much oats the horses eat in five days:

40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to find out how many bags are needed for 200 pounds:

200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

4 bags"
"First, we find out how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we need to add up all the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30 degrees Fahrenheit

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 ÷ 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit

So, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4. So, the child needs to save:

$12 - $4 = $8

The child saves $2 each day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide $8 by $2:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

It will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

16"
"The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. 

The small pizza costs $8. So, the family-size pizza costs 3 times $8, which is $8 * 3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find out how much Sally spends in all.

$8 (small pizza) + $24 (family-size pizza) = $32.

Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's figure out the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts.

Each pack costs $4.00. So, 2 packs would cost:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one for free. So, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack:
\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

This is the total cost for 2 packs of razors after the coupon. Now, we need to find out the cost per razor. Each pack has 4 razors, so 2 packs have:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]

Final answer:
25"
"First, let's find the total height of the cheerleaders in the pyramid.

There are 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, and 9 out of 10 are 64 inches tall. So, 3 of the 4 cheerleaders on the bottom are 64 inches tall, and 1 is 60 inches tall.

The total height for the bottom layer is:
\[ 3 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 = 192 + 60 = 252 \text{ inches} \]

Next, there are 3 cheerleaders on the second layer, and all of them are 64 inches tall.

The total height for the second layer is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches} \]

Then, there are 2 cheerleaders on the third layer, and both are 64 inches tall.

The total height for the third layer is:
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, the shortest cheerleader is at the top, and she is 60 inches tall.

The total height for the top layer is:
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add up the heights of all the layers to get the total height of the human pyramid:
\[ 252 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 632 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ 632 \div 12 = 52.6667 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ 52 \text{ feet and } 8 \text{ inches} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 52 \text{ feet and } 8 \text{ inches} \]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. She works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

5 minutes/hour × 8 hours/day = 40 minutes/day

After 5 days, she has walked:

40 minutes/day × 5 days = 200 minutes

So, she has walked 200 minutes."
"Brett is 14 years old now.

In four years, Brett will be:
14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, Angela's age in four years will be:
3 * 14 = 42 years old.

To find out Angela's current age, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years:
42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is 38 years old right now."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

In the morning, each ride costs $6. So, for 14 days, the cost for morning rides is:
14 days * $6/day = $84

In the afternoon, each ride costs $2. So, for 14 days, the cost for afternoon rides is:
14 days * $2/day = $28

To find the total cost, we add the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides:
$84 + $28 = $112

Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box. So, Ashley brought:
5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, Brianne brought:
50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, let's find out the total number of oranges they brought together:
50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

To make one greek orange pie, they need three oranges. So, the number of pies they can make is:

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's call the number of guests \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 for each guest, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same. So, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

Now, we know that together they found 43 insects. So, we can write the equation:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]

\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. Now, let's find out how many David found:

\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

David found 9 insects. Now, let's find out how many Lily found:

\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

Final answer: Lily found 16 insects."
"First, we need to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah used. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we calculate:

1/4 of 364 yards = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Next, we calculate how many yards Mariah's grandma used. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, we calculate:

1/2 of 364 yards = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:

91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"First, let's count the gifts for Cherrie's friends who want specific numbers of gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each:
2 friends × 5 gifts = 10 gifts

3 friends want 2 gifts each:
3 friends × 2 gifts = 6 gifts

Now, let's add the gifts Cherrie decided to get randomly:
10 more random gifts

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
10 gifts + 6 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts

Cherrie bought 26 gifts in total."
"The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

So, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

18 feet"
"Suzie bought four packs of gum. She got two packs of strawberry and one pack of grape. She also bought a small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum.

First, let's find out how much the grape gum cost. We know that the grape gum cost $2.

The green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, so:
\[ \text{Cost of green apple gum} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, we know the total cost of all the gum is $7. We can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ \text{Cost of strawberry gum} \times 2 + \text{Cost of grape gum} + \text{Cost of green apple gum} = 7 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of strawberry gum} + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of strawberry gum} + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of strawberry gum} = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of strawberry gum} = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Frederick should buy the 2 x 4 pieces of wood because they are cheaper. Each 2 x 4 piece gives him 200 sticks. 

If he spends all his $24 on 2 x 4 pieces, he can buy:
$24 ÷ $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

So, the number of popsicle sticks he can make is:
6 pieces × 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks.

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to find out how many legs all the dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has:

6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Since snowshoes are needed for each leg, Mario needs 24 snowshoes in total. Snowshoes come in pairs, so we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. We do this by dividing the total number of snowshoes by 2:

24 snowshoes / 2 snowshoes/pair = 12 pairs

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

The final answer is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day × 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for 10 trips is:

10 trips × $2.20/trip = $22.00

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, then the total cost for the week would be $20. 

To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of individual trips:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows.
The zoo has 20 sheep.
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows.
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 10 sheep (20 divided by 2).

Now, let's add up all the animals:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

60 animals"
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can find out how many Sophia bought by dividing the numbers by 4.

For onions:
12 ÷ 4 = 3 onions

For potatoes:
4 ÷ 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

Now, let's add them up to find the total:
3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market."
"Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. To lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories. So, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:

30 pounds × 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

The time from December 31st to July 19th is about 6 months. We will consider 30 days in a month, so:

6 months × 30 days/month = 180 days

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day. We do this by dividing the total calories by the number of days:

105,000 calories ÷ 180 days = 583.33 calories

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of about 583 calories each day to reach his goal. 

Final numerical answer: 583 calories"
"Gerald works every day and gets paid $30 each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we can calculate his total earnings for the week by multiplying his daily pay by the number of days he worked.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings.

\[ \text{Amount left} = 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to find out how many kilometers Hannah will run. She runs 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she will run 2 km, we multiply the distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer:

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie had $500.

First, she spent 20% of $500 on clothes. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract that from her original amount:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on CDs. Now, we subtract that from the remaining amount:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"To find out how much the house cost, we can break it down into simple steps.

1. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \).
2. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So, we can write the equation: \( L + 3L = 120,000 \).
4. This simplifies to \( 4L = 120,000 \).
5. To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4: \( L = 120,000 \div 4 = 30,000 \).
6. So, the cost of the lot is $30,000.
7. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is \( 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \).

The house cost $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each. So, she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags.

She bought each bag for $4. So, the total cost for all the bags is 40 * $4 = $160.

She sold each bag for $8. So, the total amount she earned from selling all the bags is 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total amount earned. So, the profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

Final numerical answer:

"Suzanne made 36 cookies.

Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:
\[ \text{Number of cookies Josh made} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:
\[ \text{Number of cookies Kelsie made} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's find out how much money Ali has in total.

Ali has four $10 bills, so that's:
4 * $10 = $40

He also has six $20 bills, so that's:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the two amounts to find the total:
$40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, he gives:
$160 / 2 = $80

Now, he has the remaining half:
$160 - $80 = $80

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. So, the amount he uses is:
3/5 * $80 = $48

Finally, to find out how much money he has left after buying dinner, we subtract the amount he spent from the remaining money:
$80 - $48 = $32

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is $32."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house. Rob takes 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert Rob's time to minutes:

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. First, we find double the time Rob takes:

120 minutes * 2 = 240 minutes

Then, we add 40 minutes to this time to find out how long it takes Royce:

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."

Now, the remaining problems are:
88 - 36 = 52 problems

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
So, on Wednesday, he completes:
1/4 * 52 = 13 problems

Now, the remaining problems are:
52 - 13 = 39 problems

So, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy picks twice as many strawberries as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find out how many quarts of strawberries they can pick together per hour, we add up all their amounts:

Tony: 6 quarts
Bobby: 5 quarts
Kathy: 10 quarts
Ricky: 8 quarts

6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

So, together, they can pick 29 quarts of strawberries per hour."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread.

In the morning, they sold 93 loaves. So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:
200 - 93 = 107 loaves.

In the afternoon, they sold 39 more loaves. So, the number of loaves left after the afternoon sales is:
107 - 39 = 68 loaves.

A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, the number of loaves left after the return is:
68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

The bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in each row. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:

36 red tulips ÷ 6 red tulips/row = 6 rows of red tulips

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:

24 blue tulips ÷ 8 blue tulips/row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Now, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips to find the total number of rows:

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."
"Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. She wants to divide these equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, we divide the total cups of raisins by 3.

27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups of raisins for each item.

For the oatmeal cookies, each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we divide 9 by 3/4.

9 ÷ (3/4) = 9 × (4/3) = 12 batches.

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's find out how much Ada spends on electricity per day before adding the new device.

Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. If a kilowatt per hour costs $1.50, then her daily cost is:
12 kilowatts * $1.50 = $18.00

Now, let's calculate her daily cost after adding the new device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption will be:
12 kilowatts + 2 kilowatts = 14 kilowatts

Her new daily cost will be:
14 kilowatts * $1.50 = $21.00

Next, we find the difference in her daily cost before and after adding the new device:
$21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00

To find the difference in her weekly cost, we multiply the daily difference by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
$3.00 * 7 = $21.00

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.00."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.

Now, if 5 people are working together, they can paint the house faster. To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we divide the number of days it takes one person by the number of people:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ people}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since we need to find out how many hours it would take, we know that 1 day has 24 hours. So, for 2 days, it would be:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas and chairs = 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 172

172"
"Tom paid $48 in total for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is:

$48 - $4 = $44

If Tom decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 left to buy CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy with $44 is:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
11"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 8 weeks. That's 4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours.

He also worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. That's 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And he worked out for 6 hours in one week. That's 6 hours.

Now, we add all these hours together:
32 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 48 hours.

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 48 hours."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off, so:
   48 - 8 = 40 people are left on the bus.
3. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off (8) get on the bus:
   5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
4. So, after the first stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80 people.
5. At the second stop, 21 people get off, so:
   80 - 21 = 59 people are left on the bus.
6. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off at the second stop (21):
   21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus.
7. So, after the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66 people.

Final answer: 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop."
"Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so right now Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 30 * 2 = 60.

Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years, so the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find out how many years separate their ages now, we need to consider their ages right now. Jame is 22 and his cousin will be 55 in 8 years.

So, the difference in their ages now is 55 - 22 = 33 years.

The years that separate the age of the two now is 33."
"The computer cost $1,100.

Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so the printer cost:
$1,100 - $400 = $700

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the cost for the 2 monitors and the printer is:
$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

This $600 is the total cost for 2 monitors. So, the cost for one monitor is:
$600 ÷ 2 = $300

So, one monitor cost $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought 60 (from the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) seashells.

Let's calculate that:

4 * 60 = 240

So, the girls brought 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Since the girls were divided into two equal groups, we need to divide the total number of seashells the girls brought by 2 to find out how many each girl brought.

300 / 2 = 150

Each girl brought 150 seashells.

Each girl brought 150 seashells."
"George originally had 5 + 3 = 8 candies.
Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

Nick has 16 candies."
"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Let's add these up:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma needs to make 72 vlogs in total for the month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total she needs:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

18 vlogs"
"First, we need to find out how much the tip is. The tip is 20% of $50.

To find 20% of $50, we can do:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip is $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find out how much you end up paying:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, you end up paying $60."
"First, let's find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. We do this by dividing $18 by 3.

$18 ÷ 3 = $6

So, each boy gets $6.

The eldest boy starts with $6. He then adds $5 to his share.

$6 + $5 = $11

The next day, he adds another $10 to his share.

$11 + $10 = $21

He then spends $8 from his total.

$21 - $8 = $13

After spending $8, he triples the amount he has left.

$13 × 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so the first half of the month is the first 15 days and the second half is the last 15 days.

Let's say Elvis saves $x each day in the first half of the month. In the second half, he saves twice as much, so he saves $2x each day.

For the first half:
15 days * $x = 15x

For the second half:
15 days * $2x = 30x

The total savings for the month is:
15x + 30x = 45x

We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125, so:
45x = $1125

To find x, we divide both sides by 45:
x = $1125 / 45
x = $25

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he saves:
2 * $25 = $50 each day in the second half of the month.

Final numerical answer:
$50"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples. Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each, so the cost is:
3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges. She bought five oranges at $0.80 each, so the cost is:
5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches. She bought six peaches at $0.75 each, so the cost is:
6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
$20 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's total is:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total is:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say Brad gets \( x \) dollars.
2. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4x \) dollars.
3. Together, they have 100 dollars, so \( x + 4x = 100 \).
4. This means \( 5x = 100 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5: \( x = 100 ÷ 5 = 20 \).
6. So, Brad gets 20 dollars.
7. Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets, so Jeff gets \( 4 × 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day. So, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, which is a total of 6 miles each day.

If he works 5 times a week, then he walks:

6 miles/day × 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week."
"Elise writes the alphabet twice in full. There are 26 letters in the alphabet.

So, for writing the alphabet twice, she writes:
26 letters × 2 = 52 letters

Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is:
26 letters ÷ 2 = 13 letters

After that, she re-writes everything she has already written. So, she re-writes:
52 letters (from the first two full alphabets) + 13 letters (from the half alphabet) = 65 letters

Now, we add the letters she wrote initially to the letters she re-wrote:
52 letters + 65 letters = 117 letters

So, Elise has written a total of 117 letters."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, those 3 families each call 3 other families, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 families.
3. In the third round, those 9 families each call 3 other families, so that's 9 * 3 = 27 families.
4. In the fourth round, those 27 families each call 3 other families, so that's 27 * 3 = 81 families.

So, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified."
"Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. So, the total weight he lost is:

10 pounds/month × 3 months = 30 pounds

If his final weight was 70 pounds, then his initial weight was:

70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

So, his initial weight was 100 pounds."
"James's play set has 80 toys. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's, so Jonathan needs 80 * 5 = 400 toys in total.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. This means he currently has 400 - 2 = 398 toys.

Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's find out how much Daniel needs to pay for each item before the discount.

- Five notebooks: 5 notebooks × $1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens: 2 pens × $0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator: 1 calculator × $12 = $12.00
- One geometry set: 1 geometry set × $10 = $10.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 × $30.00 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

Daniel has to spend $27.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the hamburgers. Carly orders five hamburgers at $4 each, so the cost is:
5 hamburgers * $4/hamburger = $20

Next, we calculate the total cost of the potato fries. She orders ten packs at $0.30 each, so the cost is:
10 packs * $0.30/pack = $3

Then, we calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks. She orders five cans at $2 each, so the cost is:
5 cans * $2/can = $10

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
$20 (hamburgers) + $3 (potato fries) + $10 (fruit drinks) = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change:
$50 - $33 = $17

So, the change Carly gets back is $17."
"First, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 of sales. 

For the first $1000, the commission is 30%. So, we calculate:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold $2500 in total, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]

For the sales over $1000, the commission is 10%. So, we calculate:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two amounts of commission together to find the total commission earned:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, the amount of money Antonella earned is:
\[ 450 \]"
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case having 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We know that when the water is warm, Ray takes 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Twice that time is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, we get \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes for a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time for 3 miles in each condition.

In cold water, for 3 miles, it would take \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

In warm water, for 3 miles, it would take \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time in cold water from the time in warm water:

\(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, he earns $2 x 5 = $10 each day.

He works 4 days a week, so he earns $10 x 4 = $40 each week.

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide $80 by $40.

$80 ÷ $40 = 2 weeks

It will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to find out how much the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs. The problem says it costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. 

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. So, we multiply $40 by 3 to find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

$40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to find the total cost for both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. We add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

$40 + $120 = $160

So, the final numerical answer is:

$160"
"First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. We know that there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes. So, we subtract 7 from 21 to find the number of buttons with four holes.

21 - 7 = 14

Now, we know that 14 buttons have four holes each. To find the total number of holes, we multiply the number of buttons with four holes by 4.

14 * 4 = 56

Next, we need to find the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes. We know that 7 buttons have two holes each, so we multiply 7 by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

Finally, we add the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes to get the total number of holes.

56 + 14 = 70

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"First, we find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 ÷ 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we find out how big Peter's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 ÷ 4 = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, which is 2 cups (since the daily recommendation is 4 cups).

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from Juan's current intake:

\(20 - 4 = 16\)

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together.

First, let's count the hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's count the guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45.

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

Mark's weight = 150 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

Bob's weight = 130 pounds × 2 = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and then divide by 3:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight ÷ Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds ÷ 3 = 180 pounds

The average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds."
"The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward. If the sun moves for 10 hours, it will move up by \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees.

Starting from 32 degrees, after 10 hours, the sun will be at \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees from the ground.

Final answer:
82"
"The first son is 12 years old. The second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. So, in total, they need 12 + 8 = 20 candles. A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs. So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. The cost for 4 packs is 4 * $3 = $12. 

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's figure out how many pages Judy read in the first week. 

Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week. So, in the first week, she read for:
15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can set up a simple calculation:
105 minutes ÷ 1.5 minutes/page pair = 70 page pairs

Since each page pair is 2 pages, we multiply the number of page pairs by 2:
70 page pairs × 2 pages/page pair = 140 pages

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages.

To find out the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week and the second week:
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

So, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks."
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. So, he ate:
12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. So, he ate:
12 ÷ 4 = 3 sandwiches

Together, they ate:

"Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \(x\), then we have:
\[51 = 3x\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 3:
\[x = \frac{51}{3} = 17\]

This means that in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from 17:
\[17 - 7 = 10\]

So, the nephew is 10 years old today."
"The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the tooth fairy gave:
$1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.00

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Half of $1.00 is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the tooth fairy gave:
$0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00

Now, we add all the amounts together:
$5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00."
"Richie scored 80 goals.

Mark scored 80 goals - 20 goals = 60 goals.
Anna scored 80 goals - 45 goals = 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by each:
80 goals (Richie) + 60 goals (Mark) + 35 goals (Anna) = 175 goals.

All three teenagers scored 175 goals."
"First, we need to find out how much money Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply 21 by $4:

21 × 4 = $84

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

$84 - $63 = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"Peter has $70 to spend. He spends this money over one week, which is 7 days. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures. That's 4 days. So, he spends 4 days * $10/day = $40 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he buys $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

He has $70 - $40 = $30 left for the rest of the week. From Thursday to Sunday, that's 4 days. He plans to buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He can buy $30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

23"
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up all the expenses.

1. The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
2. The cost of 3 vaccines at $20 each is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 broken vases at $12 each is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[200 + 60 + 48 = 308\]

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"Ford grows 40 roses every week.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford can only supply 40 roses every week, so the number of roses he lacks each week is:
65 - 40 = 25 roses.

There are about 4 weeks in a month, so the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"Katina removes $100 from her savings account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

If she removes $100 each month for 24 months, the total amount removed is $100 x 24 = $2400.

Katina started with $3000 in her account. After removing $2400 over 2 years, the remaining amount in her account is $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, the final amount remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is $600."
"First, let's figure out how many loaves of bread they need to make 10 sandwiches. Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of the bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of the cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
- Bread: $3.00
- Cheeses and condiments: $30.00
- Total cost: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
- 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, the net profit is $37.00."
"First, we need to find out how many crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, we multiply 3 by 64:

3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Next, we need to find out how many crayon muffins she can make. She uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin. So, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

192 / 8 = 24 crayon muffins

Now, we need to find out how much money she can make by selling these muffins. Each muffin is sold for $1.50. So, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

24 * $1.50 = $36

So, Kate can make $36 by selling her crayon muffins."
"First, we need to find the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is found by multiplying the length by the width.

18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate the cost for each part of the carpet replacement:

1. Cost of the new carpet: $12 per square foot
2. Cost of the padding: $2 per square foot
3. Cost to remove the old carpet: $4 per square foot
4. Cost to install the new carpet: $34 per square foot

Now, we'll calculate the total cost for each part:

1. Cost of the new carpet: 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592
2. Cost of the padding: 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
3. Cost to remove the old carpet: 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
4. Cost to install the new carpet: 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344

Finally, we add all these costs together to find the total cost:

$2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Next, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
280 birds ÷ 7 days = 40 birds per day

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10. So, 20 + 10 = 30.
3. She then divides this result by 5. So, 30 ÷ 5 = 6.
4. Next, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 - 12 = 8.
5. Finally, she multiplies 6 by 8. So, 6 × 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards. 

They have 7 cards together."
"First, we need to find out how much the oven is off by in percentage. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the set temperature and then multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. 

Now, if the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up being 520 degrees after the 4% increase. 

Let's call the temperature Maggie should set \( x \). The actual temperature will be \( x + 4\% \) of \( x \), which is \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).

We know that \( 1.04x = 520 \). To find \( x \), we divide 520 by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of both movies together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so the first movie is 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes long.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's.

To find out how much less Juan's house is, we need to calculate 30% of $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's.

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 x 2 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.
Her friend's total: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

120"
"First, let's find out how many contacts Pete uses each day. He has 90 contacts and they last him 45 days. So, we divide 90 by 45:

90 ÷ 45 = 2

This means Pete uses 2 contacts each day.

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, he will have:

2 boxes × 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The boxes are currently 10% off. The original price for 2 boxes is:

2 boxes × $100.00/box = $200.00

The discount is 10% of $200.00, so:

10% of $200.00 = 0.10 × $200.00 = $20.00

So, the price after the discount is:

$200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find out how much each contact will cost if he buys 2 boxes. We have 180 contacts and the price is $180.00, so:

$180.00 ÷ 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

So, each contact will cost $1.00."
"First, let's figure out how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
So, Jill worked a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
So, John worked a total of \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each person earned.

Jill earned:
- \(3\) hours \(\times\) $10/hour = $30

John earned:
- \(7\) hours \(\times\) $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
- $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories per hour.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- So, she burns \(500 \times 2 = 1000\) calories from aerobics.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories per hour.
- She spends 1 hour running.
- So, she burns \(600 \times 1 = 600\) calories from running.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = \(1000 + 600 = 1600\) calories.

Next, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:
- For 200 calories, she needs 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she needs \(\frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800\) ml of water.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than blue jelly beans, so it's \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so it's \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

Now, the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 4500 / 3 = 1500 \]

So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

Now, let's find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Final answer: 30"
"Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After some lessons, it increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his typing speed by 5 more words, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add these three numbers together and then divide by 3.

So, the sum is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

Now, we divide 156 by 3 to get the average: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will lose \(1.25 \times 5 = 6.25\) pounds.

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will gain \(1.75 \times 5 = 8.75\) pounds.

Now, we find the difference in weight change between the two options:
- The difference is \(8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15\) pounds.

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"First, let's count the people Alex invited via email. She invited 100 people.

Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is:
100 people * 2 friends/person = 200 friends

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends. So, she has invited 10 more people.

Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, the number of additional people from the called friends is:
8 spouses

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people Alex needs to seat:

100 (initial email invites) + 200 (friends of email invites) + 10 (called friends) + 8 (spouses) = 318

So, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:
- The boots cost $16.
- The shipping costs $4.
So, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's find out the total cost of the boots and shipping on eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- The shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
So, $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

So, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be 32 feet tall, which is taller than the 20 feet of the window.

Final answer: 4 days"
"First, let's find out how much protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms.

We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, 200 grams would have double that amount because 200 is double 100.

200 grams of mushrooms = 3 grams of protein * 2 = 6 grams of protein

Now, if John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 6 grams of protein each day.

To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we need to multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( x \) years.
2. Five years ago, Jerry was \( x - 5 \) years old.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is now twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation: \( x = 2 \times (x - 5) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ x = 2 \times (x - 5) \]
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
\[ x - 2x = -10 \]
\[ -x = -10 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

4. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's find out how much the dental work will cost in total.

1. Each implant costs $2000, and George needs 2 implants.
   - So, the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.

2. For one of the implants, he wants a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - So, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - So, the remaining amount he needs is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

4. George makes $15 per hour at work.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: \(3900 \div 15 = 260\) hours.

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's say the smallest angle is \( x \) degrees.

The second angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle, which is three times the smallest angle, is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's see how much money Colby has in total.

Colby has:
- 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters × 25 cents = 200 cents.
- 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes × 10 cents = 60 cents.
- 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels × 5 cents = 70 cents.
- 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies × 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents ÷ 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"Let's count the legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs have 4 legs each. So, 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
- Cats have 4 legs each. So, 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
- Birds have 2 legs each. So, 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add all the legs together:

20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48 legs

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%. To find the new weight, we calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to the original weight.

50% of 8 pounds is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the new weight is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Jamaal then uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than this new weight. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that Jamaal now uses is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Steve starts with 5 games for his birthday. 

For the first year, he buys 1 game per month, so that's 12 games. 
For the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so that's 24 games. 
For the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so that's 48 games. 

He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year, so that's 5 games for each of the 3 years, which is 15 games. 

Now, let's add everything up:

5 (birthday games) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 48 (third year) + 15 (Christmas games) = 104 games

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"First, we need to find out how fast the plane is traveling. We do this by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, we divide 1200 by 3 to find the speed in miles per hour.

1200 ÷ 3 = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We do this by dividing the distance by the speed.

2000 ÷ 400 = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour. Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, so in one hour, Ruiz makes:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolate in an hour as Ruiz does. So, Marissa makes:

60 pounds * 3/4 = 45 pounds per hour

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together.

Ruiz's total for 12 hours:
60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

Marissa's total for 12 hours:
45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

Together, they made:
720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds."
"On Monday, Howard spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, he has \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars left.

So, Howard has $12 left."
"First, let's calculate how much money Patrick earned in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 each.

For the first four hours:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour

Since he did this for 4 hours:
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.00

Next, let's calculate how much money he earned in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 each.

For the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour

Since he did this for 2 hours:
$6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00

Now, let's add the money earned from both periods to find the total amount earned.

Total money earned = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many rotations one tire makes in a month. 

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, we can find out how many rotations are made per mile by dividing 725 by 2:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles Jeremy drives in a month to find the total rotations in a month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

Next, we need to find out how many rotations one tire makes in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations per year

Now, we know each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced. To find out how many years the tire can last, we divide the total rotations by the yearly rotations:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

So, the tire needs to be replaced after 6 years.

6 years"
"First, we need to find out how many washings one pump of shampoo gives. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can divide 120 by 2 to find out how many washings one pump gives.

120 ÷ 2 = 60 washings per pump

Now, we need to find out the cost of each washing. The bottle costs $24.00, and we need to divide this by the number of washings to find the cost per washing.

24 ÷ 120 = 0.20 dollars per washing

Since we want the cost in cents, we need to convert dollars to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar.

0.20 × 100 = 20 cents per washing

Now, since each pump gives 60 washings, we need to find out the cost of each pump. We do this by dividing the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump.

20 ÷ 60 = 0.3333 cents per pump

Since we need the final answer in cents, we can round 0.3333 to the nearest cent, which is 0.33 cents.

So, each pump will cost 0.33 cents.

0.33"
"First, let's find out how much the shirt will cost after the 30% discount. 

The discount on the shirt is 30% of $25. To find 30% of $25, we do:
\[ 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discount on the shirt is $7.50. Now, we subtract this discount from the original price of the shirt:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost Joe $17.50 after the discount.

Next, we add the cost of the shorts, which is $35, to the cost of the shirt:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the shirt and shorts is $52.50, and Joe only has $50, he doesn't have enough money to buy both items. 

Therefore, Joe will not be able to make the purchase as he does not have enough money. 

Final answer: Joe will not have any money left because he does not have enough to cover the total cost."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. He plans to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days.

So, 4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants.

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter he needs for 28 dozen, we multiply 28 by 1/4.

28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds of butter.

Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- So, the cost for Monica's street is \( 194 \times 150 \).

Now, let's calculate the cost for Lewis' street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- So, the cost for Lewis' street is \( 194 \times 490 \).

Let's do the math:

For Monica's street:
\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

For Lewis' street:
\[ 194 \times 490 = 95060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ 95060 - 29100 = 65960 \]

So, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"John's research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it took 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months cost $100,000.

For the next 45 months, the cost per month was 50% more than $100,000. So, the cost per month for these months was $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The cost for the next 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the cost of the first 5 months plus the cost of the next 45 months, which is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

So, the final numerical answer is:

$6,850,000"
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

To find the total amount of meat consumed, we add the amounts together:
6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces = 30 ounces

So, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to know how many days are in March. March has 31 days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of posts:

1. Each member posts 3 times a day.
2. There are 1000 members in the group.
3. We need to find the total posts for 31 days.

First, we find the number of posts per day for the whole group:
1000 members * 3 posts/member/day = 3000 posts/day

Next, we find the total number of posts for 31 days:
3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.

First, we find out how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses:
20 gallons/load * 104 loads = 2080 gallons/year

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends:
2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height. So, it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour. He works 10 hours a day, so he sells:

15kg/hour × 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

750kg ÷ 150kg/day = 5 days

It will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, we need to find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, we multiply 4 by 18:

4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by them, so we calculate:

1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:

1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats

Now, we find out how many seats were left for the students:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

36 students

36"
"Each pole has 4 street lights. There are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

4 street lights/pole × 6 poles = 24 street lights

There are 4 intersections, so the total number of street lights is:

24 street lights/intersection × 4 intersections = 96 street lights

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

96 street lights - 20 street lights = 76 street lights

Final numerical answer:
76"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played and then add the remaining play times for each DVD.

First DVD:
- Can be played 1000 times.
- Has been played 356 times.
- Remaining play times: 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

Second DVD:
- Can be played 1000 times.
- Has been played 135 times.
- Remaining play times: 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- 644 (remaining for the first DVD) + 865 (remaining for the second DVD) = 1509 times.

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours each time. So, each week he spent 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours in therapy.

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total hours he spent in therapy are 4 hours/week x 6 weeks = 24 hours.

The cost per hour for the sessions is $125. So, the total cost for 24 hours is 24 hours x $125/hour = $3000.

The physical therapy cost is $3000."
"Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours at school. Since the school day is 8 hours long, he chews:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 after dinner, so that's:

1 piece + 1 piece = 2 pieces.

So, in total, he chews:

4 pieces (at school) + 2 pieces (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So he gives away:

14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has:

14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces of gum left."
"Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. So, we need to find out how old she is now. If she will be 16 in 12 years, that means she is 16 - 12 = 4 years old now.

Now, we need to find out how old she will be 4 years from now. If she is 4 years old now, in 4 years, she will be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, we need to find out how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, we multiply 9 by $3:

9 * $3 = $27

Next, we find out how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, we multiply 8 by $14:

8 * $14 = $112

Now, we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. We do this by subtracting the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Currently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. So, the number of bloomed flowers is:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed."
"First, we need to understand how many kilobytes (kb) are in a megabyte (Mb). We know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb.

Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second.

To find out how many megabytes she can download in one second, we divide 20 kb by 1000 to convert it to Mb:
20 kb / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour.

To find out how many megabytes Ashley can download in one hour, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, it pulled:
10 cars/day × 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars than the first three days. So, each of these days it pulled:
10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars

For the remaining four days, it pulled:
6 cars/day × 4 days = 24 cars

To find the total number of cars it towed that week, we add the cars from the first three days and the remaining four days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars it towed that week is 54."
"First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Adam needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. He is currently 40 inches tall.

To find out how much more he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the height required:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Adam grows 2 inches a year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the total inches he needs to grow by the inches he grows each year:
8 inches ÷ 2 inches/year = 4 years.

So, Adam needs 4 years to grow enough to ride the roller coaster.

4 years"
"First, we need to find out how much the company paid for each car. Since the company paid 30% of the price of each car, we calculate 30% of $25,000.

To find 30% of $25,000, we do:
\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

So, the company paid $7,500 for each car.

Next, we need to find out how much the company sold each car for. Since James sold each car for $25,000, the selling price is $25,000.

Now, we calculate the profit made on each car by subtracting the cost from the selling price:
\[ 25,000 - 7,500 = 17,500 \]

James sold 10 cars, so the total profit from selling all the cars is:
\[ 17,500 \times 10 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the total profit. So, we calculate 10% of $175,000:
\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[ 17,500 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate 25% of 100 riders:

25% of 100 = 0.25 × 100 = 25 riders

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. We calculate 40% of 25:

40% of 25 = 0.40 × 25 = 10 men

So, the final numerical answer is:

10 men can stay upright on the wave."
"The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.

The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of a diamond Jewell. So, we calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:
\[ \text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. So, we calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:
\[ \text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To solve this, we need to find out how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob and then see how long it will take for Tom to cover the 75 miles gap.

1. First, we find the difference in their speeds:
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Difference: 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

2. This means Tom is closing the gap by 15 miles every hour.

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75 miles gap:
   - Distance to cover: 75 miles
   - Speed difference: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance ÷ Speed
   - Time = 75 ÷ 15 = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught:
11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, we need to find out the cost per class. Manny paid $60 for 10 classes. So, we divide $60 by 10 to find the cost per class.

$60 ÷ 10 = $6

The cost per class is $6. Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can miss some classes without his parents stopping the classes. 

Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss. We know that if the cost per class goes over $10, his parents won't sign him up again. So, we need to see how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

If the cost per class is $6, we need to find out how many classes he can miss so that the cost per class doesn't go over $10. 

Let's say he misses x classes. Then he will have taken 10 - x classes. The cost per class would then be $60 divided by (10 - x).

We need to find the maximum x such that the cost per class is still $10 or less.

$60 ÷ (10 - x) ≤ $10

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

$60 ≤ $10 * (10 - x)

$60 ≤ 100 - 10x

10x ≤ 40

x ≤ 4

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10. 

Final numerical answer:
Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again."
"Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. So, if Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes 50 x 2 = 100 customers a day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of customers each of them processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers/day x 7 days/week = 350 customers/week.
Julie processes 100 customers/day x 7 days/week = 700 customers/week.

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their weekly totals together:

350 customers/week (Jewel) + 700 customers/week (Julie) = 1050 customers/week.

Final numerical answer:
1050"
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, we need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, 1 apple costs $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, 1 orange costs $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges will cost.

For 5 apples:
- 5 apples cost 5 × $1.30 = $6.50

For 5 oranges:
- 5 oranges cost 5 × $1.10 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to find out how much earth Bob needs to dig out. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

6 feet (length) × 4 feet (width) × 3 feet (depth) = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:

72 cubic feet × 3 seconds per cubic foot = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's find out Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

Tim's original salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise on $20,000 is:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
\[ 21,000 \div 2 = 10,500 \]

So, his total monthly salary with the bonus is:
\[ 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
\[ 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"First, let's find out how much the suits cost in total. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
10 suits * $750/suit = $7500

Next, let's find out the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the cost of one dress pant is:
$750 / 5 = $150

James buys 10 dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500

Now, let's find out the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he has 10 suits. So, he buys:
10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts

Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800

Finally, we add up the total cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find out how much everything costs:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800

So, the total cost for everything is $10800."
"The news website publishes 20 articles every day. So, in February, it would publish:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. So, in February, it would publish:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Together, the two websites would publish:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

Final numerical answer:
840"
"Steve is 60 years old.

His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is 29."
"First, we need to find out how much flour is in one bag. The problem says that one bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

1. Calculate the amount of flour in one bag:
   \[
   8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since we know one bag contains 16 kilograms, we can find the total for three bags by multiplying the amount in one bag by 3.
   \[
   16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time Alisa biked: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time Stanley biked: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil. He has to dig 24 feet of soil, so it will take him:
24 feet ÷ 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Bill digs half as fast through clay, which means he digs 2 feet per hour through clay. He has to dig 8 feet of clay, so it will take him:
8 feet ÷ 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

To find out the total time, we add the time for soil and clay:
6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."
"Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates. That makes a total of 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people.

Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). So, for 27 people, Howie needs to buy 27 * 2 = 54 cupcakes.

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Fishio initially got 2000 likes.

After 3 weeks, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we calculate 70 times 2000:

70 * 2000 = 140,000 likes.

Recently, she received 20,000 more likes.

To find the total number of likes, we add the initial likes, the likes after 3 weeks, and the recent likes:

2000 (initial) + 140,000 (after 3 weeks) + 20,000 (recent) = 162,000 likes.

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 162,000."
"First, let's calculate how much Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so:
20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400

She got $2 off with her voucher, so:
$400 - $2 = $398

Now, let's calculate how much Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price on Wednesday was $30 per pomegranate, so for 20 pomegranates:
20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600

She got a 10% discount on the total cost, so:
10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days.

Difference = Sheila's final price - Clara's final price
Difference = $540 - $398 = $142

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"First, let's find out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, and this was half the amount she earned from green hats. So, the sales from green hats would be:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, in the first month, Ariadne made $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats. Adding these together gives the total sales for the first month:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, we calculate the sales for the second month as:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

Now, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The second and third hours cost twice as much as the first, so each of these hours costs $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the total cost is:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Adding these up: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420. This means she received an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week. Her weekly wage should be $300, but since she only received $220, the difference must have been withheld. So, $300 - $220 = $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

The final numerical answer is:
$80"
"Lori needs 1 egg for 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, then each guest will need 3/2 = 1.5 eggs.

For 16 guests, she will need 16 guests * 1.5 eggs/guest = 24 eggs.

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, she will need 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens of eggs.

2 dozens"
"Shiela has to write 15 pages in total. She has finished 1/3 of the paper.

To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate 1/3 of 15:
1/3 * 15 = 5 pages

So, Shiela has written 5 pages.

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
15 - 5 = 10 pages

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:

200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's find out how much James spends on the hanger and fuel each month.

The hanger costs $5000 a month.

The fuel costs twice as much as the hanger, so:
\[ 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

So, the total monthly cost for the hanger and fuel is:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the first year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 15000 \times 12 = 180000 \]

Adding the cost of the plane:
\[ 150000 + 180000 = 330000 \]

So, the total cost for the first year is:
\[ 330000 \]"
"First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.

It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the time to cook pork is:
30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, we first find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes

Now, the time to cook beans is half of 80 minutes:
80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the time for rice, pork, and beans:
30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"First, let's find out how much the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs.

For almonds:
- 1 pound of almonds costs $10.
- So, 1/2 pound of almonds costs $10 * 1/2 = $5.

For walnuts:
- 1 pound of walnuts costs $15.
- So, 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $15 * 1/3 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of almonds and walnuts for the first mixture:
- Total cost = $5 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $10.

Next, let's find out how much the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs.

For almonds:
- 1 pound of almonds costs $10.
- So, 1/5 pound of almonds costs $10 * 1/5 = $2.

For walnuts:
- 1 pound of walnuts costs $15.
- So, 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $15 * 1/3 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of almonds and walnuts for the second mixture:
- Total cost = $2 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $7.

Finally, let's find out how much more the first mixture costs than the second mixture:
- Difference = $10 (first mixture) - $7 (second mixture) = $3.

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this, let's think step by step.

1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's say the number of sheep is \( S \) and the number of geese is \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads is 20, so \( S + G = 20 \).
- The total number of legs is 70, so \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's find out how much the more expensive coffee costs. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand is 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5, we do:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee. Since he uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week. 

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. 

So, the total cost is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:
44"
"Gus spent $20.00 in total. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, let's add up the cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda:
- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- Bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- Bottle of soda: $1.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent $20.00 in total, so to find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $20.00:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"James delivers newspapers to three districts. We know the total number of newspapers he delivers in a day is 600. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. To find out how many newspapers he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers.

First, let's add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
198 (District A) + 209 (District C) = 407

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers:
600 (total) - 407 (District A and C) = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

193"
"First, we need to find out how many hours John spends in the cooking class in total. 

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, each week, he spends:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total hours spent in the class are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5:
\[ 48 \text{ hours} \div 1.5 \text{ hours/recipe} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, we need to find out how many teachers are history teachers. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find this, we multiply 150 by 60%.

150 × 60% = 150 × 0.60 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers.

Next, we need to find out how many teachers are math teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

So, there are 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps.

60 × 6 = 360

So, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120 = $90

Now, Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, Rayna's money is:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60 = $90 + $60 = $150

Now, let's add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

Total money = Rayna's money + Kassidy's money + Aurelia's money
Total money = $150 + $90 + $120 = $360

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each would have:

Each person's share = Total money / 3
Each person's share = $360 / 3 = $120

So, each would have $120."
"Sarah's basketball game has 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

12 minutes x 4 = 48 minutes

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how many employees are in management. We know that 20% of the 50 employees are management. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 × 50 = 10

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. We know that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. So, we calculate 30% of 10:

30% of 10 = 0.30 × 10 = 3

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt needed for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Now, let's add these up for one muffin:
5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins, we multiply the total for one muffin by 16:
8.25 × 16 = 132 tablespoons

So, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"First, we need to find out the total amount of candy they have together. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, we add these amounts:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"First, we need to find out how much Adam spent on the candies.

For type A candies:
- Adam bought 7 candies.
- Each candy of type A costs $0.5.
- So, the total cost for type A candies is \(7 \times 0.5 = 3.5\) dollars.

For type B candies:
- Adam bought 10 candies.
- Each candy of type B costs $0.75.
- So, the total cost for type B candies is \(10 \times 0.75 = 7.5\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = cost of type A candies + cost of type B candies
- Total cost = \(3.5 + 7.5 = 11\) dollars.

Adam paid $15 to the cashier. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
- Change = amount paid - total cost
- Change = \(15 - 11 = 4\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4 dollars."
"Christina had 12 good days in total. The first 8 days were good, and the next good day and the day after that were also good. So, she had 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 good days in the first 11 days. 

Since the total number of good days is 12, we subtract the 10 good days she already had from the total. 

12 - 10 = 2

So, there are 2 good days left in the month.

"Janey has 21 books.

Let's say Sally has \( x \) books.

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 21 = 2x + 3 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2x \]
\[ 18 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = x \]
\[ 9 = x \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, we need to understand the current height of the bamboo and the target height. The bamboo is currently 20 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the current height to inches:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow, we subtract the current height from the target height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 12 toys for these 12 dogs.
4. When James comes back, there are twice as many dogs as before, so the number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. Since 3 dogs are gone, James no longer needs those 3 toys.

Now, let's add up all the toys James needs:
- Initially, he had 4 toys.
- He bought 12 more toys for the 8 new dogs, so now he has 4 + 12 = 16 toys.
- He then bought 12 more toys, so now he has 16 + 12 = 28 toys.
- Since 3 dogs are gone, he no longer needs those 3 toys, so he has 28 - 3 = 25 toys in total.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 25."
"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200.

Dylan's investment = 2/5 * $1200 = $480

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment.

Money left = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Money left = $1200 - $480 = $720

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.

Frances's investment = 2/3 * $720 = $480

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Frances's investment.

Money left = Money left after Dylan - Frances's investment
Money left = $720 - $480 = $240

So, Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is $240.

Skyler's investment = $240"
"First, we need to find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer have together now. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So, we add these numbers together:

20 + 44 = 64

Now, the sisters want to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"Karen earns twice what Lorie earns. Since Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns $10 x 2 = $20 per hour.

Karen works 3 hours per day. So, in one day, she earns $20 x 3 = $60.

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we first find out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then:

36 hash browns ÷ 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:

96 potatoes × 6 hash browns per potato = 576 hash browns

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of the 8 adults. Each adult weighs 80 kg, so we multiply 80 kg by 8.

80 kg/adult * 8 adults = 640 kg

Now, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Since Jack is also an adult, his weight is 80 kg.

640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

The elevator can only support 700 kg. To find out how much they have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

So, they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Katarina has 68 cookies.

Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has:
68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has:
73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:
73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up all the cookies:
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

They have 298 cookies in total."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length.

1. The final length of the dress is 140cm.
2. This final length includes an extension of 50% of the original length and an additional 20cm of lace trim.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

- The extension of 50% of the original length is \( 0.5x \) cm.
- Adding the lace trim of 20cm to the extended length gives us the final length of 140cm.

So, the equation to represent this is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes Chris to mow the lawn in each mode.

In ""turtle"" mode, it takes him 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, mowing the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode takes 60 minutes.

In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes him 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Now, Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

For the ""turtle"" mode part:
- Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode would take half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

For the ""rabbit"" mode part:
- Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode would take half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

To find out the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn, we add the time for both parts together:
- 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

They eat 10 cookies, so we subtract those from the total: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.
The final number of cookies in the box is 80."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the age of the younger triplet is \( x \).
2. Then, the age of the older twin is \( x + 7 \).
3. The other two triplets are the same age as the younger one, so their ages are also \( x \).
4. The combined ages of all four children are 44.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4x + 7 = 44 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 4x = 37 \]
\[ x = \frac{37}{4} \]
\[ x = 9.25 \]

So, the younger triplet is 9.25 years old. The older twin is:
\[ x + 7 = 9.25 + 7 = 16.25 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 16.25 years old."
"First, let's add up the time John needs for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert this to minutes:
- 3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time John needs for homework from the total time he has:
- Time for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's find out how much the candies cost. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is $3.20 divided by 4, which is $0.80.

Now, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. So, 10 lollipops will cost $0.40 multiplied by 10, which is $4.00.

For the candies, 10 candies will cost $0.80 multiplied by 10, which is $8.00.

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 plus $8.00, which equals $12.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$12.00"
"First, let's find out how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins, and Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we calculate 2/5 of 20:

2/5 * 20 = 8

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil saves:

20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

Rong saves: 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year
Neil saves: 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year

Next, we calculate how many coins they save in ten years:

Rong saves: 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins
Neil saves: 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins

Finally, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:

2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

So, after ten years, Rong and Neil are having 5760 coins in total."
"First, let's find out the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20 and there are 2 vaccines, so:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so:
\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + x \]

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can write:
\[ x = 0.60 \times (40 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.60 \times (40 + x) \]
\[ x = 24 + 0.60x \]
\[ x - 0.60x = 24 \]
\[ 0.40x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the heartworm check costs $60. Now, we can find the total bill:
\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Final answer:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one banana costs. Since one apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple, a banana costs:

\[ 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. Since an orange costs three times as much as a banana, an orange costs:

\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas, and each banana costs $1, so the total cost for the bananas is:

\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples, and each apple costs $0.5, so the total cost for the apples is:

\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges, and each orange costs $3, so the total cost for the oranges is:

\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits to find the total cost of the crate:

\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is:

\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color Brittany's comforter has.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, let's add up all the squares:
- Red: 14
- Blue: 18
- Green: 24
- White: 12

Total squares = \(14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\)

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

68 square feet"
"First, let's find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. The problem states that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available:

\[ \text{Total chairs available} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Chairs to get} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total chairs available} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

50 deer * 50% = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

25 bucks * 20% = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"First, let's find out how many points Betty collected. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Adam has 50 points.

To find 30% of Adam's points:
30% of 50 = 0.30 * 50 = 15 points

So, Betty collected:
50 points (Adam's points) + 15 points = 65 points

Next, we need to find out how many points Tom has. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.

Tom's points:
65 points (Betty's points) - 30 points = 35 points

Now, we know that Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 35 points.

Marta's points:
3 * 35 points = 105 points

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35
Marta's points: 105

Total points:
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, we need to find out how many more points they are missing.

Points needed:
400 - 255 = 145 points

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of these children has three grandchildren. So, the total number of grandchildren is:

3 children × 3 grandchildren per child = 9 grandchildren

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great-grandbabies. So, the total number of great-grandbabies is:

9 grandchildren × 3 great-grandbabies per grandchild = 27 great-grandbabies

So, there will be 27 great-grandbabies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"First, we need to find out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account. 

To find 50% of $2400.00, we do:
\[ 2400.00 \times 0.50 = 1200.00 \]

So, Greta puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we need to find out how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment. 

To find 20% of $2400.00, we do:
\[ 2400.00 \times 0.20 = 480.00 \]

So, Greta uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after putting money into her retirement account and paying for her car. We subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck.

The total amount spent is:
\[ 1200.00 + 480.00 = 1680.00 \]

So, the amount left is:
\[ 2400.00 - 1680.00 = 720.00 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend."
"There are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils in the box.

To find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we divide the number of pencils by 2 because a pair means 2 pencils.

So, 16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs of pencils.

8 pairs of pencils are in the box."
"First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city will set off. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, we multiply 15 by 20:

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks that is, we calculate 40% of 300:

40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, we multiply 3 by 5:

3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

So, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks."
"First, let's find out how many people are going to the cinema. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and then they meet 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:

13 (Aiden and his friends) + 7 (more friends) = 20 people

Each person gets to save a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. So, for drinks and snacks, we need to calculate the total for all 20 people.

For drinks:
2 drinks per person × 20 people = 40 drinks

For snacks:
3 snacks per person × 20 people = 60 snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2. So, we calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks:

Cost for drinks: 40 drinks × $2 = $80
Cost for snacks: 60 snacks × $2 = $120

Now, we add the cost of drinks and snacks together to find the total amount spent:

$80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200

So, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds. So, to find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we need to subtract the amount that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total.

First, we add the amounts that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul:
4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

Now, we subtract this from the total amount the three trucks can haul:
11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800 pounds"
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the males ate a total of 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the females ate a total of 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to find out how much money Gerald and Julia each got when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 ÷ 5 = $20.

So, Gerald got 3 parts, which is 3 × $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he had $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Gerald had $50 left."
"First, we need to find out how fast Martha's turtle can crawl. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run 15 feet per second.

To find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:
15 feet/second ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second

This means the turtle can crawl 3 feet per second.

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"They have raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find out how much they need to raise in each hour, we can divide the amount they have raised by the number of hours.

$2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how much more they need to raise to reach their goal of $6300, we subtract what they have already raised from their goal.

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

To find out how many more hours they need to fundraise, we divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour.

$4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for a total of 3 (initial hours) + 6 (additional hours) = 9 hours.

Final numerical answer:
9"
"First, we need to find out what part of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes by the city. 

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Out of this, 80% is used for industrial purposes. So, we need to find out what part is not used for industrial purposes.

To find the part used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial part from the total part the city uses:

40% (total used by the city) - 80% of 40% (used for industrial purposes).

First, calculate 80% of 40%:
80% of 40% = 0.80 * 40% = 32%

So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

Now, subtract this from the total 40% used by the city:
40% - 32% = 8%

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final numerical answer:
8%"
"Alex charges $12 per day for tutoring. 

For 1 week, which has 7 days, she would charge:
7 days * $12/day = $84

Since we need to find out how much she charges for 2 weeks, we multiply the weekly charge by 2:
$84 * 2 = $168

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"First, let's find out how much chocolate ice cream the factory can make in one hour. Since it makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, we divide 100 by 2:

100 ÷ 2 = 50 quarts per hour

Next, let's find out how much vanilla ice cream the factory can make in one hour. Since it makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, we divide 50 by 4:

50 ÷ 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour

Now, let's see how much of each type of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2400 quarts

For vanilla ice cream:
12.5 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 600 quarts

Finally, let's add the amounts of both types of ice cream to find the total:

2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

So, in 48 hours, the factory would make 3000 quarts of ice cream in total."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins) = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $50.00:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00. Each scoop costs $1.50. 

First, let's see how many scoops she can buy with her money:
$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

Now, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 scoops free because:
- 4 scoops / 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) = 1 full set of 3 (2 paid + 1 free) and 1 extra scoop paid for.

So, she will have:
- 2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop (from the first set of 3) + 1 extra paid scoop = 4 scoops in total.

Final answer: Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream."
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
4 pieces/day × 14 days = 56 pieces

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
3 pieces/day × 14 days = 42 pieces

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56, so she has:
100 - 56 = 44 pieces left

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42, so she has:
100 - 42 = 58 pieces left

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
58 - 44 = 14 pieces

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"First, we need to find out how much area Mr Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

To find two thirds of 36, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, for every square foot, Mr Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need:
\[ 24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ mosaic tiles} \]

So, Mr Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles."
"First, let's find out how much James paid for picking the blueberries. He paid $20 to go picking and then $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds.

The cost for the 30 pounds is:
$1.5 * 30 = $45

So, the total cost for picking the blueberries is:
$20 (for going) + $45 (for the blueberries) = $65

Now, let's calculate how much it would cost to buy 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound.

The cost at the store is:
$2.5 * 30 = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
$75 (cost at the store) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10

So, James saved $10 compared to buying at the store."
"First, we need to find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the increase, we calculate 10% of $700:

10% of $700 = 0.10 * $700 = $70

So, the new price of each computer is:

$700 + $70 = $770

Now, we need to find out how much the company paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

500 * $770 = $385,000

The total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce has 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
2 ounces * 120 calories/ounce = 240 calories

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 ounces, and each ounce has 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
2 ounces * 40 calories/ounce = 80 calories

Finally, we add up all the calories to find the total calories in the omelet:
450 calories (from eggs) + 240 calories (from cheese) + 80 calories (from ham) = 770 calories

The omelet has 770 calories."
"First, we need to find out how much the pencils cost. If one pencil costs $0.50, then 6 pencils would cost:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, we find out how much the erasers cost. If one eraser costs $0.25, then 8 erasers would cost:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

If you paid $10 and the total cost was $5, then the change you would get is:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."
"First, we find out how many people receive interviews. 

30% of 100 people apply for the job:
30/100 * 100 = 30 people

Next, we find out how many of those who receive interviews get a job offer. 

20% of the 30 people who receive interviews:
20/100 * 30 = 6 people

Then, we find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept it. 

A third of the 6 people who receive a job offer:
1/3 * 6 = 2 people

So, 2 people accept the position.

2 people accept the position."
"Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. That's a total of 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, the total kilograms of rice she gave away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

So, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother."
"This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, the total number of boxes she bought this week is 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week.

So, 8 - 4 = 4

Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes with her feet when her arms are not raised. She taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. So, for both feet, she taps \(300 + 250 = 550\) times per minute.

Since she does not raise her arms for 3 minutes, the total number of taps in those 3 minutes is \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps.

Next, we calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised. With her arms raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot, so for both feet, she taps \(200 + 200 = 400\) times per minute.

Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps in those 2 minutes is \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps.

Now, we add the taps from both periods to get the total number of taps. The total number of taps is \(1650 + 800 = 2450\).

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 2450."
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing it and compare it to the cost of the damage to his car.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
- The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
- The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 each, so 3 buckets cost $25 x 3 = $75.

Adding these together, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:
$120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the damage to his car, which is $450.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is:
$450 (damage) - $195 (cost to fix) = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"The restaurant originally has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. 

If 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, we need to subtract these from the original numbers.

For normal chairs:
170 - 20 = 150

For baby chairs:
23 - 13 = 10

Now, to find the total number of chairs left, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together:
150 + 10 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."

Each pizza has 12 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas:
- 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices (because 12 * 2/3 = 8)

So, Bryce and each of the two friends ate 8 slices, which means:
- 3 people * 8 slices = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
- 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices (because 12 * 3/4 = 9)

So, the two friends ate 9 slices each, which means:
- 2 people * 9 slices = 18 slices

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten:
- 24 slices (from Bryce and his two friends) + 18 slices (from the two remaining friends) = 42 slices

Each of the five friends ordered one pizza, so the total number of slices is:
- 5 pizzas * 12 slices = 60 slices

Now, let's find out how many slices were left:
- 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

So, the final answer is:
18 slices"
"The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages.

The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes. So, we calculate 2/3 of 30 minutes:
2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, to find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2 (since there are two animals):

(30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12:

\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add the 4 inches to this result:

\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be written as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's find out how many windows are in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in students' cars is:

64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows. So, the number of windows she smashes from students' cars is:

1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows

Next, let's find out how many windows are in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is:

32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of these windows. So, the number of windows she smashes from teachers' cars is:

3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows

Now, we add the windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed:

64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows

So, Hannah smashes 112 windows."
"First, let's count the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

Now, let's add these numbers to find the total number of spools:

15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. The blue spools are the light blue and dark blue ones:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45

Adding these together:

15 + 45 = 60

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

(Blue spools / Total spools) × 100

So, we have:

(60 / 150) × 100 = 0.4 × 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line.
2. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted. So, we need to find 2/5 of 5000.
   - 2/5 of 5000 = (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.
3. So, 2000 people had voted by midday, which means 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left.
4. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. So, we need to find 2/3 of 3000.
   - 2/3 of 3000 = (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.
5. So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00, which means 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he needs for 30 days, we multiply 4 by 30.

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that each pack has 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack.

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's find out how many smores the kids want. There are 9 kids and each wants 2 smores. So, we multiply 9 by 2:

9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores

Next, let's find out how many smores the adults want. There are 6 adults and each wants 1 smore. So, we multiply 6 by 1:

6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores

Now, let's add the smores for kids and adults to find the total number of smores needed:

18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = 24 smores

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 large smores. To find out how many sleeves we need, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve can make:

24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

3 boxes"
"Dora is 15 years old.

First, let's find Dora's father's age:
Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8
= 30 + 8
= 38

Next, let's find Dora's mother's age:
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34

Now, let's calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"Greg has 3 younger siblings, so in total, there are 4 people (Greg + 3 siblings).

To split $20 equally among 4 people, we divide 20 by 4.

"Cindy's math book weighs 2 pounds.
Cindy's science book also weighs 2 pounds.
Cindy's French book weighs 4 pounds.
Cindy's English book weighs 3 pounds.
Cindy's history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 3 pounds * 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
2 pounds (math) + 2 pounds (science) + 4 pounds (French) + 3 pounds (English) + 6 pounds (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. So, Candidate A got 20 votes (because 20% of 100 is 20).

Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A. So, Candidate B got 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 is 10. So, Candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, let's add the votes of Candidate A and Candidate B: 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

There were 100 voters in total. So, the votes for Candidate C would be the remaining votes after subtracting the votes of Candidate A and Candidate B from the total votes.

So, Candidate C got 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Beck has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we subtract 23 from the number of apples Boris has.

Boris has 100 apples.
Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to add 10 to the number of apples Beck has and subtract 10 from the number of apples Boris has.

After Boris gives Beck 10 apples:
- Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
- Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has.

90 - 87 = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"First, let's see how much water Peter uses for each type of cube.

For the giant cubes:
- He makes 3 giant cubes.
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- So, 3 giant cubes use \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces of water.

For the medium cubes:
- He makes 7 medium cubes.
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- So, 7 medium cubes use \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces of water.

For the small cubes:
- He makes 8 small cubes.
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- So, 8 small cubes use \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces of water.

Now, let's add up all the water used:
- Water used for giant cubes: 12 ounces
- Water used for medium cubes: 14 ounces
- Water used for small cubes: 4 ounces

Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water left is:
- \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can find out how many books Steven has by dividing Clara's number of books by 2.

So, Steven has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, Alice has \(10 + 6 = 16\) books.

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has.

So, Clara has \(20 - 16 = 4\) more books than Alice.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"A gallon jar costs $5. 

A half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

For 10-gallon jars, the cost is 10 * $5 = $50.

For 16 half-gallon jars, the cost is 16 * $3 = $48.

The total amount of money she spent is $50 + $48 = $98.

98"
"First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that 5 students like to play basketball and the number that like to play music is twice that number. So, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Next, we know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is:

\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \]

The total number of students in the class is 50. To find out how many students like to play video games or play music, we subtract the number of students who like to bake or play basketball from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - 15 = 35 \]

We already know that 10 students like to play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."
"Jeremy saw 12 birds. He scared away 1/3 of them. So, 1/3 of 12 is 4 birds. That means 12 - 4 = 8 birds stayed. Then, 20 more birds joined the 8 that were left. So, 8 + 20 = 28 birds are now in the backyard.

28"
"Each class has 40 students because 80 divided by 2 equals 40.

In each class, 40% of the students are girls. So, 40% of 40 students is 16 girls because 40 times 0.40 equals 16.

If there are 40 students in each class and 16 of them are girls, then the number of boys in each class is 40 minus 16, which equals 24.

So, there are 24 boys in each class."
"Mara started with 2 slices of cake on the plate. She added 3 more slices, so now she has:
2 + 3 = 5 slices

She then tripled the number of slices, so:
5 * 3 = 15 slices

Mara ate 2 slices, so now she has:
15 - 2 = 13 slices

Her friend stole 5 slices, so the final number of slices left on the plate is:
13 - 5 = 8 slices

8 slices remained on the plate."
"First, we need to find out the total number of animals Melissa has to groom. 

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Now, we add them all together:

8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Melissa has 28 animals to groom in total.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to split the 28 animals evenly over the 7 days.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's find out how much Mark spent on the packs of cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he got. He has one card worth $4000, another worth $1000, and 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each. So, the value of the 30 cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find out the profit, we subtract the amount he spent from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:

\[ 1100 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for the first amusement park. 

For 2 adults, the cost is:
2 adults * $26/adult = $52

For 2 children, the cost is:
2 children * $12/child = $24

So, the total cost for the first amusement park is:
$52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second amusement park.

For 2 adults, the cost is:
2 adults * $14/adult = $28

For 2 children, the cost is:
2 children * $10/child = $20

So, the total cost for the second amusement park is:
$28 + $20 = $48

Now, to find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park.

$76 - $48 = $28

So, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, but now he buys them for $0.4 each. 

First, we find out how much he saves per tomato:
$0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1

Then, we calculate how much he saves per day by multiplying the savings per tomato by the number of tomatoes he sells each day:
$0.1 * 500 = $50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we find out how much he saves in a week by multiplying the daily savings by 7:
$50 * 7 = $350

So, the tomato vendor saves $350 a week."
"Sean has 56 marbles.

Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, so Cal has:
2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has:
4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:
224 (Carl's marbles) + 112 (Cal's marbles) = 336 marbles.

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined."
"First, we need to find out how many students are in each of the six groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

54 students ÷ 6 groups = 9 students per group

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups. We do this by multiplying the number of students per group by the number of groups needed:

9 students per group × 12 groups = 108 students

Now, we need to find out how many more students are needed to form 12 groups. We do this by subtracting the number of students we currently have from the number of students needed:

108 students - 54 students = 54 more students

To find out how many more groups are needed, we divide the number of additional students by the number of students per group:

54 more students ÷ 9 students per group = 6 more groups

So, we need 6 more groups to form 12 groups in total.

Final numerical answer:
6 more groups"
"First, let's figure out how many chairs are rented during a weekday and a weekend in one week.

- During weekdays (Monday to Friday), Candy rents out 60 chairs each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
  60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs

- During weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Candy rents out 100 chairs each day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so:
  100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs

Now, let's add the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends to find out the total number of chairs rented in one week:
300 chairs (weekdays) + 200 chairs (weekends) = 500 chairs/week

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 4 weeks in each month, two 4-week months would be 8 weeks. So, we multiply the weekly total by 8:
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

So, in two 4-week months, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs."
"Gunther started with 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of them, so:
48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas left.

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold then stole 12 bananas:
49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, Gunther found that there were 43 bananas in the pile."
"First, we need to find out how much each roommate pays per month. Since the total electricity bill is $100 and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates), we divide $100 by 5.

$100 ÷ 5 = $20

So, each person pays $20 per month.

Now, to find out how much each person pays per year, we need to multiply the monthly amount by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

$20 × 12 = $240

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity."
"Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.

First, let's find out how many glasses and plates he sent in total:
- 1 dozen equals 12 items.
- So, 8 dozen glasses = 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.
- And, 4 dozen plates = 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses and plates were returned:
- 10 glasses were broken, so 96 - 10 = 86 glasses were returned.
- 6 plates were broken, so 48 - 6 = 42 plates were returned.

Now, let's add the glasses and plates returned:
- Total glasses and plates returned = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now."
"First, let's figure out how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. So, she trades \(30 \times 0.90 = 27\) small stickers for large buttons.

Next, let's see how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. So, she trades \(40 \times 0.50 = 20\) large stickers for large buttons.

Now, let's calculate how many small stickers and large stickers she has left after the trades. She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27, so she has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers left. She started with 40 large stickers and traded 20, so she has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left.

Next, we need to convert the remaining large stickers into small buttons. Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers are worth \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

Now, let's add up all the buttons Lorraine has. She has 27 large buttons from trading small stickers, 60 small buttons from trading large stickers, and 3 small stickers that can be considered as small buttons (since each small sticker is worth 1 small button). So, the total number of buttons she has is \(27 + 60 + 3 = 90\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
He played 1 match on Friday.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which means he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches.
So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

7 matches"
"To solve this problem, let's use some simple math.

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. Since there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).
3. The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of votes in favor and against is 33.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

22"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so:
   11 (extra-small) * 2 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so:
   22 (small) - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so:
   18 (medium) / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so:
   9 (large) + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add all the students together to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

So, Krissa ordered 75 shirts."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 bag, we need to calculate the discount amount first and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - 5% of $140 = (5/100) * 140 = 0.05 * 140 = $7

2. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   - $140 - $7 = $133

So, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"First, we need to find out how many songs John has in total. Since he has 20 playlists and each playlist has 300 songs, we can find the total number of songs by multiplying 20 by 300.

20 playlists * 300 songs per playlist = 6000 songs

Now, if each song is 10 hours long, we can find the total hours by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

6000 songs * 10 hours per song = 60000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 × 50 = 10 people

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. We subtract the 10 people from the total 50 people:

50 - 10 = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate 60% of 40:

60% of 40 = 0.60 × 40 = 24 people

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

40 - 24 = 16 people

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 is one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is 6 times 3, which is 18.
3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 is two thirds of Jana's puppies, then the total number of Jana's puppies is 18 times 3 divided by 2, which is 27.

So, Jana has 27 puppies."
"Jayden had $70.

Ava gave Jayden half of her $90 allowance. Half of $90 is $45. So, Jayden received $45 from Ava.

Now, let's add the money Jayden had to the money he received from Ava:
$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the money he has from the cost of the camera:
$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

Now, we know the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]

\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs the same amount as the second house, which is 100 cases.

Final answer: 100"
"Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each, so he spends 1 * $3 = $3.
Together, they spend $6 + $5 + $3 = $14 to make a salad for the potluck."
"George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, we need to find out how many pears he has.

First, we calculate 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:
200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits

Final numerical answer:
490"
"Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. So, the money left for candy bars is:

$80 - $20 = $60

Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars Marissa could buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. So, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 times 5 kilograms of oranges, which is 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, for 20 kilograms of oranges, Sam would have to spend 20 times $3.

20 * $3 = $60

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour. He decided to read 150 more books, so he read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour. So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Altogether, they read 450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's total) = 600 books."
"Tanya teaches for 5 hours on Monday and earns $15 per hour. So, for Monday, she earns:
5 hours * $15/hour = $75

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3 classes, so she gets an additional $5:
$75 + $5 = $80

On Wednesday, she teaches for 2 hours and earns:
2 hours * $15/hour = $30

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes, so she does not get the additional $5.

Now, we add the earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
$80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110

Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching."
"First, we need to find out how many vanilla scents were sold. They sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so:
5 vanilla scents * 4 vanilla scents = 20 vanilla scents

Next, we need to find out how many fruity scents were sold. They sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so:
2 fruity scents * 8 fruity scents = 16 fruity scents

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. We do this by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more vanilla scents

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents."
"Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, the money he makes from eggplants is:
20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He already has $60 from selling eggplants. So, the money he needs to make from selling corn is:
$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total money he needs from corn by the number of ears of corn:
$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3/ear"
"Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so she has a total of 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

If she reads for 3 hours, then the remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, so she plays video games for 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

So, (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils

So, after giving pencils to Brandon, Anthony had:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils left

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

So, after giving pencils to Charlie, Anthony had:
25 - 15 = 10 pencils left

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"Jack drives 150 miles to the museum at 75 mph. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by the speed:

150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

So, it takes him 2 hours to get to the museum. 

Since he drives the same speed and distance back, it will also take him 2 hours to return home.

He spends 6 hours at the museum.

To find out how long he is gone from home, we add the time to get to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time to return home:

2 hours (to the museum) + 6 hours (at the museum) + 2 hours (back home) = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many wheels are needed for the cars. Since each car needs 4 wheels, and Henry needs to assemble 57 cars, we can calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars by multiplying 57 by 4.

57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles. Since each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, we can calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles by multiplying 73 by 2.

73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed.

228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box.

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

So, the final number of wheels left is 276."
"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - 20% of $1000 is calculated as \( 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \).

2. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   - $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in series.

Now, let's find out the cost for these series movies. Since they cost $6 each, the total cost for the series movies is:

200 movies * $6/movie = $1200.

Next, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. We subtract the series movies from the total:

600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies not in series.

Now, 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. So, the number of older movies is:

400 movies * 40% = 160 older movies.

The cost for these older movies is:

160 movies * $5/movie = $800.

The rest of the movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each. The number of normal movies is:

400 movies - 160 movies = 240 normal movies.

The cost for these normal movies is:

240 movies * $10/movie = $2400.

Finally, we add up the costs for all the movies:

$1200 (series) + $800 (older) + $2400 (normal) = $4400.

So, the total cost to replace the movies is $4400."
"Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches at $2.00 per pound, so he spent 6 * $2.00 = $12.00 on peaches.
He picked 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 per pound, so he spent 8 * $1.00 = $8.00 on plums.
He picked 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 per pound, so he spent 6 * $3.00 = $18.00 on apricots.
In total, Winston spent $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00 on fruit.

$38.00"
"First, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at half the driving speed minus 5 miles per hour. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour minus 5 miles per hour, which is 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. To find out how far they hiked, we multiply the speed by the time:
20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, let's find out how far they drove. They drove for the rest of the 6 hours, which is 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours. At 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is:
50 miles per hour * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's break down the points for both Ava and Emma based on the information given.

First, let's say Emma jumps on \( E_e \) enemies and collects \( B_e \) berries. The time left on the timer for Emma is \( T_e \) seconds.

Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_e + 3 \) berries. The time left on the timer for Ava is \( T_e + 4 \) seconds.

Now, let's calculate the points for each:

For Emma:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E_e \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times B_e \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times T_e \)
- Total points for Emma: \( 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \)

For Ava:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_e + 8) = 10E_e + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_e + 3) = 5B_e + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (T_e + 4) = 30T_e + 120 \)
- Total points for Ava: \( 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e + 120 = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215 \)

Now, let's find the difference in their scores:
- Difference: \( (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) = 215 \)

So, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"The four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of these two pizzas is 30 dollars.

To find out how much the remaining 34 dollars cover, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

This 34 dollars is the cost of the other two pizzas, and since they cost the same amount, we divide 34 dollars by 2:
34 dollars ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

Each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, for those 5 days, they ride:
3 rides/day × 5 days = 15 rides

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:
2 × 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day

For the two days, they ride:
6 rides/day × 2 days = 12 rides

Now, we add the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week.

27 rides"
"Bob originally had 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's figure out how many white fish he bought.

Before buying, Bob had 4 white fish. Let's say he bought \( x \) white fish at the store. So, the total number of white fish he has now is \( 4 + x \).

He also bought some orange fish. Before buying, he had 3 orange fish. Let's say he bought \( y \) orange fish at the store. So, the total number of orange fish he has now is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, after buying the fish, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

We also know that he bought a total of 17 fish, so:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the second equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many miles Andy drives in a week. He drives to work and back home each day, so that's 2 trips a day. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so each day he drives 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

From Monday to Friday, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, we know Andy's car uses 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles (10 MPG). So, for 50 miles, he would use 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons of gas.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so for 5 gallons, he would spend 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
10 × $20 = $200

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
140 × $0.25 = $35

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
$200 + $35 = $235

Next, we need to find out how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on twenties is:
3/5 × $200 = $120

The amount spent on quarters is:
140 × $0.25 = $35

So, the total amount spent is:
$120 + $35 = $155

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
$155"
"Ricardo has 5 tomato plants. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes from the tomato plants is:
5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

Ricardo also has 8 eggplant plants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. So, the total number of eggplants from the eggplant plants is:
8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together:
110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

Final numerical answer:
142"
"Samwell's store sold smart TVs which were one-fourth of the total sales. So, the number of smart TVs sold is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Analog TVs sold were one-eighth of the total sales. So, the number of analog TVs sold is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

The rest of the TVs sold were OLED TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"First, we need to find out how much the school will cover. The school will cover half of the trip cost, which is $300. So, we divide $300 by 2:

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

This means the school will cover $150 of the trip cost.

Now, we need to find out how much more money John needs. The total cost of the trip is $300, and John has $50. We also know the school will cover $150. So, we need to find out how much is left after the school's contribution:

$300 - $150 = $150

This is the amount that needs to be covered by John and possibly others. Since John already has $50, we need to find out how much more he needs:

$150 - $50 = $100

So, John is missing $100."
"First, we need to find out the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we need to find out how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

The difference between the current night temperature and the required temperature is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

20 degrees ÷ 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people were formed. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

90 people ÷ 9 people/group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells:

3/5 × 10 groups = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

6 groups × 2 seashells/group = 12 seashells

So, the final answer is 12 seashells."
"Let's start with the number of people on the train, which is 172.

At the first stop, 47 people get off:
172 - 47 = 125 people are left on the train.

Then, 13 more people get on the train:
125 + 13 = 138 people are now on the train.

At the next stop, 38 people get off:
138 - 38 = 100 people are left on the train.

So, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. 

So, the money he makes each day is:
10 bottle caps * $0.25 per bottle cap = $2.50 per day.

"Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20. For the additional hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. 

First, let's find out her special hourly rate:
150% of $20 = 1.5 × $20 = $30

Jamie worked 8 regular hours and 3 additional hours (since 11 total hours minus 8 regular hours equals 3 additional hours).

Now, let's calculate her pay for the regular hours:
8 hours × $20/hour = $160

And her pay for the additional hours:
3 hours × $30/hour = $90

Now, let's add both amounts to find her total pay for the day:
$160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counted 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions as female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. There are also 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

32"
"First, we need to find out how much the jeans cost after the 25% discount.

The original price of the jeans is $40. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.

$40 - $10 = $30

The sale price of the jeans is $30. Now, Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.

To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the $50.00 bill.

$50.00 - $30.00 = $20.00

Mike will have $20.00 left over."
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of new employees hired is:
20 employees/month × 3 months = 60 employees

The initial number of employees is 200. Adding the new employees, the total number of employees after three months is:
200 employees + 60 employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees each month is:
260 employees × $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly payment by 3:
$1,040,000/month × 3 months = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"First, we need to find out how long the choir will sing ""Deck the Halls"". Since they will sing it twice and each time it is 150 seconds long, we multiply 150 by 2.

150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

Next, we need to find out how long they will sing ""Jingle Bells"". Since they will sing it once and it is 240 seconds long, we just use 240 seconds.

240 seconds

Now, we add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" together to find the total time they will be caroling.

300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"First, let's find out how much Billy earns per hour at each stage of his job.

1. Billy's starting hourly rate: $10.00
2. After 2 months, his hourly rate increased by $0.50: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50
3. On his first anniversary, his hourly rate increased by $1.00: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

Now, let's find out Sally's starting hourly rate. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary:
Sally's starting hourly rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50

Next, we calculate how much each of them earns for 20 hours of work.

Billy's earnings for 20 hours: $11.50 * 20 = $230.00
Sally's earnings for 20 hours: $10.50 * 20 = $210.00

Finally, we find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally:
$230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00

Billy earns $20.00 more than Sally."
"First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so:
3 loaves * $2/loaf = $6

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so:
2 bagels * $1/bagel = $2

Now, we need to find out how much more the loaves of bread cost than the bagels:
$6 - $2 = $4

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of Pierson's points would be:
278 ÷ 2 = 139

Now, we add 11 to this number to find out Nikita's points:
139 + 11 = 150

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their points together:
278 (Pierson's points) + 150 (Nikita's points) = 428

Pierson and Nikita had a total of 428 points."
"First, let's find out how many students there are in total. There are 40 classes and each class has 25 students. So, the total number of students is:

40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is:

1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Now, let's find out how many teachers there are in total. There are 40 classes and each class has 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Finally, to find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1240 trees

So, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's count how many stuffed animals Bubbles already has. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Now, let's add these up:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's say the total number of stuffed animals, including the goats, is \( T \). We know that the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of \( T \).

The number of stuffed goats is \( 0.30 \times T \).

Since the goats are the only new stuffed animals, the total number of stuffed animals \( T \) will be the current 14 stuffed animals plus the number of goats she buys. Let's call the number of goats she needs to buy \( G \). So, \( T = 14 + G \).

We know that \( G = 0.30 \times T \). Substituting \( T \) with \( 14 + G \), we get:
\[ G = 0.30 \times (14 + G) \]

Now, let's solve for \( G \):
\[ G = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times G \]
\[ G = 4.2 + 0.30G \]
\[ G - 0.30G = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70G = 4.2 \]
\[ G = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ G = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final answer: 6"
"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. Half an hour each day for 14 days is:
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. A week has 7 days, so:
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Now, we add the hours from both periods:
7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the hours she still needs to play are:
30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To solve this, we need to find out how much distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[ 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

3. The difference in distance after 2 hours is:
   \[ 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

Final answer: 20 miles"
"First, we need to find the total cost of the diamond and the gold. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost is:

$600 + $300 = $900

Next, James pays a 30% premium for the ring to be made. To find the premium, we need to calculate 30% of $900:

30% of $900 = 0.30 × $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the original cost to find the total amount James paid:

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170."
"First, let's find out how many students passed in each grade.

For third graders:
340 out of 500 passed.

For fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed.

For fifth graders:
The pass rate for fourth graders is 40 out of 100, which is 40%.
The fifth graders' pass rate is twice that, so it's 80%.
80% of 400 fifth graders is 0.80 * 400 = 320 students.

Now, let's add up the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.

Total students:
500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students

Total students who passed:
340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 680 students

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

Overall pass rate = (680 / 1000) * 100 = 68%

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"Milo has 2 bags of glass chips. Each bag has 72 chips. So, the total number of chips he has is:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we need to know how many chips are needed for each inch. It takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic.

First, we calculate the total number of chips needed for the height of the mosaic:
\[ 3 \text{ inches} \times 12 \text{ chips per inch} = 36 \text{ chips} \]

Now, we need to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be with 144 chips. Since 36 chips are needed for each 3 inches, we can find the length by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips needed per 3 inches:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{36 \text{ chips per 3 inches}} = 4 \text{ sets of 3 inches} \]

So, the mosaic can be:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ inches long} \]

Final answer:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's find out how much tea the four students drank in total. Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts, so:

4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, let's find out how much tea the 16 students drank in total. Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts, so:

16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, let's add the tea that the four students and the sixteen students drank:

6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

We know there are 10 quarts left, so the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:

38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party by dividing the total quarts by 4:

48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

So, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party."
"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. So, he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more.

First, let's see how many candies he had after selling 150:
100 (initial) - 150 (sold) = -50

This means he sold 50 more candies than he had initially. Then he ordered 100 more:
-50 (deficit) + 100 (new order) = 50

So, Dale now has 50 candies. He needs to sell all of these to sell all his candies.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies."
"Let's count the number of students each month:

- At the beginning of January, there are 10 students.
- By the end of January, the number doubles: 10 x 2 = 20 students.
- By the end of February, the number doubles again: 20 x 2 = 40 students.
- By the end of March, the number doubles again: 40 x 2 = 80 students.
- By the end of April, the number doubles again: 80 x 2 = 160 students.
- By the end of May, the number doubles again: 160 x 2 = 320 students.

To find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number at the end of May:

320 (end of May) - 10 (beginning of the year) = 310

So, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how much Felix made in a week. The problem states that he made $105 in a week.
2. We know that every branch he climbs costs $.25.
3. To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:
   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
   \]
4. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches climbed by 7 to find out how many branches he climbed per day:
   \[
   \text{Branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
   \]

So, Felix climbed 60 branches per day on average."
"First, let's count the total number of petals Rose picked:

- She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- She picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- She picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- She picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, let's add these up to find the total number of petals she picked:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we need to account for the flowers she dropped. She dropped 1 of each type of flower she picked:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals from the dropped flowers is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Now, we subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals she picked:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's find out how many marshmallows they used to make S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores. So, they used a total of:

9 (John's S'mores) + 9 (DeSean's S'mores) = 18 marshmallows

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

18 (used for S'mores) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows

Now, we know the bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract the marshmallows used and dropped from the original amount:

35 (original amount) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14 marshmallows left

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

14 (remaining marshmallows) ÷ 2 = 7 marshmallows each

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. 

Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter.

The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack plays for 240 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 12 games.

The two friends who play for 10 minutes each play for 240 minutes / 10 minutes per game = 24 games in total.

The better friend plays for 240 minutes / 30 minutes per game = 8 games.

So, in total, they play 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, they use 44 quarters.

44 quarters is the same as 44 / 4 = 11 dollars.

Final numerical answer: 11 dollars."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( x \) ounces.
2. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( x \) ounces.
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so it is \( 2x \) ounces.
4. The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so it is also \( 2x \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) ounces.

Now, we need to find the total amount of all the ingredients and make sure it adds up to 10 ounces:

- Citrus zest: \( x \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( x \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2x \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2x \) ounces
- Oil: \( 4x \) ounces

Adding these together, we get:

\[ x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10x \]

This total should be 10 ounces:

\[ 10x = 10 \]

So, \( x = 1 \).

Now, we can find the amount of oil:

\[ \text{Oil} = 4x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."
"John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so the goats cost him 3 * $500 = $1500.
He also buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so the cows cost him 2 * $1500 = $3000.
In total, John spends $1500 + $3000 = $4500."
"Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total.

He already has:
- 8 chocolate cupcakes
- 40 toffee cupcakes

So, the total number of cupcakes he already has is:
8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:
63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, he sells \(40 \times 20\% = 40 \times 0.2 = 8\) cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, he gives away \(8 \times 2 = 16\) cars.

The total number of cars Joe gives away and sells is \(8 + 16 = 24\) cars.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is \(40 - 24 = 16\).

Joe remains with 16 cars."
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to divide this amount equally among the 20 students. So, we divide $125,000 by 20:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.

So, the total time Sandy walked in the two days is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter counted 50 cars in the morning. During the first break, 20 more cars came, so the total became 50 + 20 = 70 cars. During the lunch break, half of the cars left, so the number of cars became 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.

First, we find out how much John makes in one cycle:
5 tasks × $1.20 per task = $6.00 per cycle

Next, we find out how much John makes in one day:
30 cycles × $6.00 per cycle = $180.00 per day

Now, we find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week:
7 days × $180.00 per day = $1260.00

So, John makes $1260.00 in a full 7-day week."
"Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.
Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.
To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, we multiply 8 by 11:

8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:

6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. We do this by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

88 - 36 = 52.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

Now, we know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, let's find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have.

Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards."
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had:
5 green eggs * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had:
10 blue eggs - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had:
9 pink eggs / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = 27 eggs.

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will get from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of that.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Milly will lose. This is the cost of the book minus the refund plus the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Money lost} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \]

So, Milly will lose $11."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100. So, she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the cost for the jeans is:

2 × $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount of money she had:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week.

The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is:
8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the chocolate bars produced in the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. So, the amount he produces in the fourth week is:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs each week. She spends 2 hours a week on this.

Next, we calculate the time she spends on makeup. She does this for 15 minutes six days a week, so:
15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week

Now, let's convert the time spent on writing songs into minutes:
2 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes/week

Now, we add the time spent on writing songs and doing makeup:
120 minutes/week (writing) + 90 minutes/week (makeup) = 210 minutes/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 840 minutes/month

So, Britany spends 840 minutes on TikTok in a month."
"First, let's figure out what Angela needs installed and how much it will cost.

The base cost for the installation is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors (2 more than the base)
- 2 chandeliers (1 more than the base)
- 20 pictures (10 more than the base)

For the additional items, the cost is $15.00 per item.

Let's calculate the additional cost for mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures:

- Mirrors: 2 additional mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- Chandeliers: 1 additional chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- Pictures: 10 additional pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

Now, add these to the base cost:

$129.00 (base cost) + $30.00 (mirrors) + $15.00 (chandeliers) + $150.00 (pictures) = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"Eva has saved $20.00.

Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
Anthony has saved $30.00.

Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. First, we find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy has saved:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Roy has saved $42.00."
"First, let's find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain. Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, we need to multiply these numbers.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. So, Saskay can lift:
1 inch * 12 = 12 inches

Kagiyami can lift:
12 inches * 4 = 48 inches

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so:
48 inches * 10 = 480 inches

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet:
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. So, the distance he covers in the first part is:
8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance he covers in the second part is:
8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance he has traveled, we add the distances from both parts of his journey:
32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo will also take 18 hours because they are all traveling at the same speed.

Now, if a kangaroo travels at a certain speed, a turtle travels at half that speed. So, it will take a turtle twice as long to travel the same distance.

Since it takes one kangaroo 18 hours, it will take one turtle \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we have four turtles, but the time it takes for them to travel across the highway is still based on the speed of one turtle. So, it will still take 36 hours for the four turtles to travel across the highway.

Final answer: 36 hours."
"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
2 × 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

Final numerical answer:
140"
"First, let's figure out the final price of the laptop after the trade-in. The original price is $600, and the trade-in reduces the price by $200. So, the new price is:

$600 - $200 = $400

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has:

$400 - $50 = $350

Now, let's see how much money Erika has from other sources. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, the total from these sources is:

$150 + $80 = $230

Since Erika has $350 in total and $230 from other sources, the amount of money she has in her purse is:

$350 - $230 = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large and small apples.

For the large apples:
- Adam has 3 large apples.
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- So, from 3 large apples, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

For the small apples:
- Adam has 5 small apples.
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- So, from 5 small apples, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples:
- Total slices from large and small apples = \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices. So, we subtract the slices he ate from the total slices:
- Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Final numerical answer:
15"
"The farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk from one cow. So, from 3 cows, he gets:

5 liters/cow × 3 cows = 15 liters

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more liters he needs:

25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Since each cow gives 5 liters, to get the additional 10 liters, he needs:

10 liters ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:
2"
"First, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is not used. 

For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left, the not used part is:
1 - 1/6 = 6/6 - 1/6 = 5/6

For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left, the not used part is:
1 - 2/3 = 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3

For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left, the not used part is:
1 - 1/2 = 2/2 - 1/2 = 1/2

Now, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is not used in millimeters. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, we can calculate the not used part for each:

For the first glue stick:
5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters

For the second glue stick:
1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters

For the third glue stick:
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add up all the not used parts:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. So, the total cost is:

$10000 + $800 = $10800

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, the total money Gabriel has is:

$5000 + $200 = $5200

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the money he has from the total cost:

$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills. So, the total amount she gave is:

4 × $20 = $80

The hat cost $70. To find out how much change Thea got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the amount she gave:

$80 - $70 = $10

So, Thea got $10 in change."
"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the cost is 6 * $2 = $12.

He buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the cost is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total cost of his purchases is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost of his purchases from the amount of money he started with: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"Jack collected 60 dishes.

Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2.
So, Jack has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \(30 \times 2 = 60\) socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) dishes.

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes:
- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = \(30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180\).

180"
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total. So, we subtract the students who are good in English only and those who are good in math only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add those who are good at math only and those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students are good at math.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"First, let's see how much time each group needs to perform and move on. Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is:

2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes per group

The concert is 2 hours long. We need to convert this to minutes:

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute slots fit into 120 minutes, considering there is a 10-minute intermission:

120 minutes (total concert time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes available for groups

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert."
"Brenda's scheme accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. The original amount is $300.

First, we need to find out how much interest she earns each year. Three-quarters of $300 is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

So, Brenda earns $225 in interest each year.

Now, we need to calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is the original amount plus the total interest earned:
\[ 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, we can calculate this by dividing 40 by 2:

40 ÷ 2 = 20

So, 20 white shirts have collars. This means the number of white shirts without collars is:

40 - 20 = 20

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:

50 - 20 = 30

Now, to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons:

30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"The farmer has 900 eggs. Each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

If he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total earnings will be:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. So, he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

So, the final numerical answer is:
70 goats"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. In a year, there are 12 months. So, he buys shoes 12 times 2 pairs, which is 24 pairs in a year.

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends by the number of pairs he buys.

So, we do $2640 divided by 24 pairs.

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food baskets. Each basket of green food costs $25, and you are buying 3 of them. So, the total cost for the green food is:

\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food baskets. Each basket of red food costs $18, and you are getting $2 off for each basket of red food. So, the cost for each basket of red food after the discount is:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the red food to find the overall total cost:

\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

\[ 123 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we divide 90 by 2:

90 ÷ 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find out how long it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply 20 minutes by 45:

20 × 45 = 900 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. We do this by dividing 900 by 60:

900 ÷ 60 = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

15 hours"
"In the first year, they will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they will build \(12 \times 3 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, they will have built \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built by the end of the second year. So, they will build \(48 \times 2 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, over the next three years, the town will have built \(48 + 96 = 144\) homes.

144"
"Let's use simple words to solve this problem.

1. Let's say your age is \( x \).
2. Your brother is 3 years older than you, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. Your sister is 2 years younger than you, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so her age is \( 3 \times (x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we add all our ages together and it should equal 87:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3 \times (x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 87 - 9 \]
\[ 6x = 78 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. He has 27 students and wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to have enough for all the students and have some extra glue sticks left over.

Final numerical answer:
7 packs"
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, the amount of water becomes:
4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the amount of water becomes:
8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"On the first day, 10 people are infected. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. So after the first day, 10 + 60 = 70 people are infected.

On the second day, 70 people are infected, and each infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. So after the second day, 70 + 420 = 490 people are infected.

On the third day, 490 people are infected, and each infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections. So after the third day, 490 + 2940 = 3430 people are infected.

Final answer: 3430"
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers. So, the total amount Rafaela received is:

$20 × 40 = $800

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

10% of $800 = 0.10 × $800 = $80

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. Therefore, the amount Julieta received is:

$800 - $80 = $720

To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their amounts:

$800 + $720 = $1520

The final numerical answer is:
$1520"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which is 2 oranges × 3 daughters = 6 oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, she gave away 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges she remained with is 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in 1 year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber earns:
1 badge / 2 = 0.5 badges per month
0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy earns:
3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges:
36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours.

In 1 hour, she bakes 2 banana bread loaves. So in 5 hours, she bakes:
2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So in total, she has:
10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So the total amount raised is:
80 slices × $0.50/slice = $40

So, Paige raised $40 in the fundraiser."
"Gretchen has 70 gold coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, the number of silver coins she has is:

70 (gold coins) - 30 = 40 (silver coins)

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the gold coins and the silver coins together:

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins

So, Gretchen has 110 coins in total."
"First, we need to find out how many burritos were given to the students. There are 50 students and each student got 10 burritos. So, we multiply 50 by 10:

50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Next, we add the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate:

500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Now, we know that Mr. George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos were left, we subtract the number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos:

600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

12 (red cars) - 2 = 10 green cars

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. Since there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, we can calculate the number of blue cars as follows:

10 (green cars) × 3 = 30 blue cars

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find out how many yellow cars there are by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

75 (total cars) - 12 (red cars) - 10 (green cars) - 30 (blue cars) = 23 yellow cars

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that together they have 85 books. So, we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Fawn has 28 books."
"Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. Since the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs. If there are 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, then:

30 kids * 4 jello cups per kid = 120 jello cups

Next, we need to find out how many 3-ounce boxes of jello Greg needs. Since 1 box makes 10 small jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of cups per box:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups per box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to find out how much 12 boxes will cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello."
"First, we need to find out how much the seller spent on the phones. The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. So, we multiply 5 by $700:

5 * $700 = $3500

The seller spent $3500 on the phones. The seller gave $4000 to the seller. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, we need to find out how much Madeline pays in a month. Since she pays 60% of the $400, we can calculate this by:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 in a month. Since Keenan pays the rest, we can find out how much Keenan pays by subtracting Madeline's share from the total:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan pays per week by dividing his monthly share by 4:

\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

To find 2/5 of 60, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, on the first day, Tobias ate 24 pieces.

Now, let's see how many pieces are left after the first day:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the remaining pieces after the second day are:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, Tobias ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Tobias ate:
\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

For soda:
Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00. So, the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00.

For water:
Four bottles of water cost $8.00. So, the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 × $3.00 = $9.00.

The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 × $2.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Final numerical answer:
$13.00"
"First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts will cost. Each bolt costs $0.03.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the bolts from the money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

Final answer: $12.00"
"Ella earns money by walking dogs. First, we need to find out how much she earns per hour.

She earned $33 for 3 hours. So, to find her hourly rate, we divide the total amount by the number of hours:

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we need to find out how much she would earn in 12 hours. We multiply her hourly rate by 12:

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles. So, let's add those together:

52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many that is, we need to divide 80 by 4:

80 ÷ 4 = 20 marbles

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from the 80 marbles he had:

80 - 20 = 60 marbles

Paul has 60 marbles left."
"First, let's calculate the points Amy gets from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 multiple-choice questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. So, the number of correct multiple-choice answers is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \]
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the points from multiple-choice questions are:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

Next, let's calculate the points Amy gets from the true/false questions. There are 20 true/false questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. So, the number of correct true/false answers is:
\[ 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \]
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, the points from true/false questions are:
\[ 18 \times 1 = 18 \]

Now, let's calculate the points Amy gets from the long-answer questions. There are 5 long-answer questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. So, the number of correct long-answer answers is:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the points from long-answer questions are:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Finally, we add up all the points from the different types of questions:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens. To find out how many chickens he plans to sell, we multiply 300 by 3/5:

300 * 3/5 = 180 chickens

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling these 180 chickens at $50 each. First, we calculate the total selling price of the 180 chickens:

180 * $50 = $9000

This is the total amount of money Isaias will get from selling the chickens. To find out how much he bought the chickens for, we need to subtract the profit from the total selling price:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32.

First, we need to find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together. We do this by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many each of them sold:
18 ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah."
"Iris spent $400 on her hair.

For the manicure, she spent 1/4 of $400:
$400 ÷ 4 = $100

For the pedicure, she spent 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure:
$100 × 3/4 = $75

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

"First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long and she can sell it for $2 per meter.

So, the total money she will get from selling the rope is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we need to find out how much the new rope will cost. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, let's assume she wants to buy a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

So, the cost of the new rope is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah got from selling her rope to find out how much money she will have left over:
$40 - $30 = $10

So, the final answer is:
$10"
"Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. So, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

To find out when her age will be thrice her present age, we need to calculate when she will be 3 times 8, which is 24 years old.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

So, in 16 years, her age will be thrice her present age.

16 years."
"First, let's find out how much each packet of chicken costs. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, one pack of bacon costs $10 ÷ 5 = $2. Therefore, each packet of chicken costs 2 × $2 = $4.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the chicken. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is 6 × $4 = $24.

Now, let's find out the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost for strawberries is 3 × $4 = $12.

The cost of each pack of apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is 7 × $2 = $14.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $60 = $5

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's think step by step:

1. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concert.
2. She also performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the final concert.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, we need to find out how long the concert part (excluding the encore) is. We do this by subtracting the encore time from the total runtime:

65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes (concert part)

Now, we know that this 50-minute concert part is twice as long as her usual concert. So, to find the length of her usual concert, we divide the concert part by 2:

50 minutes ÷ 2 = 25 minutes

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes."
"Argo starts with 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with.

So, we do: 200 - 40 - 80 - 30

First, 200 - 40 = 160
Then, 160 - 80 = 80
Finally, 80 - 30 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

To find out how many chimichangas they make on those three days, we add the numbers together:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

So, they make 500 chimichangas on those three days."
"First, we need to find out how many microphones won't find any space to fit in. We know that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit.

To find 20% of 50, we do:
20 ÷ 100 × 50 = 10

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in.

Now, we need to find out how many microphones can be arranged in pairs. We subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones:
50 - 10 = 40

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that can fit. We do this by dividing the number of microphones that can fit by 2:
40 ÷ 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20 pairs"
"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 

2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead is:
2/3 * 6 = 4 birds.

3 groups of eight birds each feeding is:
3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Adding all the birds together:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds.

Final numerical answer:
34"
"Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She put these 50 cookies into 5 jars equally. So, we divide 50 by 5.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

Each jar had 10 cookies."
"First, let's find out how many petals the orchids have in total. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals from the orchids is:

5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Next, let's find out how many petals the African daisies have in total. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals from the daisies is:

4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:

40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, we find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of 100 plants are indoor plants, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Next, we find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:
\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]
These 75 plants are either outdoor plants or flowering plants.

Two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]
So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find out how many flowering plants there are, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:
\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 flowering plants.

To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"A thingamabob spins at 11 times slower than a whatchamacallit. Since a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing 121 by 11.

121 ÷ 11 = 11 meters per second

A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

11 × 5 = 55 meters per second

A whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods every day.
5. The cost of the carrots is the total cost minus the cost of the salad and yogurt, so $11 - $9 = $2.
6. Ellen eats 2 carrots every day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Mark used to make $10 an hour. Now, his pay was raised by $2, so he makes $10 + $2 = $12 an hour.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, the total hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his hourly wage by the total hours he works in a week. So, $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to figure out how much she earned from mowing lawns over the two weeks.

First, let's figure out how much Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn. We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. This is the amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn.

Next, we need to find out how much she earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns. We know that the amount she earned from mowing Kamala's lawn is three times the amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn, and the amount she earned from mowing Alba's lawn is five times the amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn.

So, the amount she earned from mowing Kamala's lawn is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

And the amount she earned from mowing Alba's lawn is:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money she earned from mowing lawns:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns, we can find out how much she made from lemonade sales by subtracting the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"First, let's find out how much Carl weighs. Since Carl is 16 kg more than Martin, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight.

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find out how much Christian weighs. Christian is 8 kg more than Carl, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight.

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find out how much Harry weighs. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight.

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, he rents it for a total of 10 * 3 = 30 hours a month.

He gets paid $25 an hour. So, for 30 hours, he earns 30 * $25 = $750.

His car payment is $500. 

To find the profit, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings. So, $750 - $500 = $250.

John makes a profit of $250 on his car."
"First, let's figure out how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she must have originally had:

7 notebooks - 5 notebooks = 2 notebooks

Now, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

3 times 2 notebooks = 6 notebooks

Now, let's find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has:

7 notebooks - 6 notebooks = 1 notebook

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"Dijana rowed for 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. So, we need to find 1/5 of 50 miles first:
1/5 of 50 = 50 / 5 = 10 miles.

Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. So, we add this to Dijana's distance:
50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"Susan originally had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, so now there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total pages read by Denise are 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"Calvin's pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 bowl. That's 2 bowls for the adults.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and 2 of those bowls are for Calvin and his wife, there are 2 adult bowls left. These 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (because 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls).

Calvin has 2 children, and there are 4 child bowls left. If each child eats one bowl, they will each have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 times a bowl of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
5 notebooks × $1.50/notebook = $7.50

Then, we add the cost of the ballpen:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

So, William spent $8.00 in all."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can break it down into two parts: the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4: \(2 \div 4 = 0.5\) yards per small mask.
- Now, to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply 0.5 yards by 20: \(0.5 \times 20 = 10\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3: \(2.25 \div 3 = 0.75\) yards per large mask.
- Now, to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply 0.75 yards by 8: \(0.75 \times 8 = 6\) yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks together:
- Material for small masks: 10 yards
- Material for large masks: 6 yards
- Total material needed: \(10 + 6 = 16\) yards

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"Deepa saw each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies 3 times. So, the total number of times she went to the theatre is:

9 movies * 3 times each = 27 times

She spent $216 in total for all these visits. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

$216 ÷ 27 tickets = $8 per ticket

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.
So, the total time he spends on these activities is 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours.
There are 24 hours in a day.
To find out how much free time Harold has, we subtract the time he spends on activities from the total hours in a day.
So, 24 - 19 = 5 hours.
Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3 of them. So, the blue shoe boxes left are:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes and uses 1/3 of them. To find out how many he uses, we calculate:
1/3 of 9 = 9 ÷ 3 = 3 red shoe boxes.

So, the red shoe boxes left are:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

The final numerical answer is:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes are left in Tim's box."
"Sarah has 9 books.

Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books.

Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 
1/5 of 30 is 30 ÷ 5 = 6 marbles.

So, after giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles left.

Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.
So, after giving 10 marbles to Donald, Dean has:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles left.

Final answer: Dean has 14 marbles left."
"Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.
Let's say Adam's age four years ago was \(x\). According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we have:
\[52 = 2x\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[x = 52 / 2 = 26\]
So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is:
\[26 + 4 = 30\]
In 8 years, Adam will be:
\[30 + 8 = 38\]
So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres * 2 = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.

Together, the two farms have 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres.

700 acres"
"Colby completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for each package, so for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he earns 8 * $8 = $64.

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. 

First, let's find out how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle:
- A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
- An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long, so \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 180 minutes, there are \(180 \div 60 = 3\) hours.
- Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, in 3 hours, he drinks \(3 \times 2 = 6\) bottles of water.

So, the final numerical answer is:
6"
"Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there were 20 red balloons, he threw \(20 \times 2 = 40\) pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

He threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Let's say there were \(y\) yellow balloons. So, he threw \(3y\) pieces of bologna at the yellow balloons.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, we can write the equation:
\[40 + 3y = 58\]

To find \(y\), we need to solve the equation:
\[3y = 58 - 40\]
\[3y = 18\]
\[y = \frac{18}{3}\]
\[y = 6\]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Jon drives 100 miles a day. In a 30-day month, he drives:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

His car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, to find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles for each tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so that's 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so that's 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.

To find out how many hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add up the hours from each day:
5 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 8 hours (Thursday) = 23 hours.

So, Bruce works 23 hours in all these three days."
"First, let's find out how much the balloons cost. Since 1 dozen balloons are 12 balloons and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost of 12 balloons as follows:

12 balloons / 2 balloons = 6
6 * $0.5 = $3

So, the balloons cost $3.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Since each tub of ice cream costs $7 and they bought 2 tubs, the total cost for the ice cream is:

2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14

Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, and the total cost is $28, this means that the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine is $28.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total allowance by 2 to find out how much each one received:

$28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Total pieces of fruit Kira bought = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

So, the number of pieces left = 14 - 2 = 12 pieces

Final numerical answer:
12"
"First, we need to find out how many students are playing volleyball. We know that there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. So, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are playing soccer. We know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. So, we add these numbers together:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students:

\[ 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. Since there are 30 students and each student sold 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so:

300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so:

300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$240 - $150 = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
Cats: 3
Dogs: 9
Rabbits: 7
Fish: 21
Gerbils: 7

3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.
Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.
The loaf has 24 slices.
To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day.
So, 24 slices ÷ 6 slices per day = 4 days.
The loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old. She collects one shell every month. To find out how many shells she has by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday.

From 5 to 10 is 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 by 12.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

So, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

60"
"Lana has 27 cups in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:
27 cups ÷ 3 rows = 9 cups per row

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea.

So, in each row, the number of mint tea cups is:
9 cups ÷ 2 = 4.5 cups

Therefore, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

4.5"
"To find out the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

First, let's see how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we divide 8 by 4:

8 ÷ 4 = 2 trips

Now, the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total. To find out how many berries he needs to pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 ÷ 2 = 12 berries

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries.

12 berries"
"First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons

Now, the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We need to find out how much water will be left after 6 days. To do this, we multiply the daily emptying rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

This means that 3000 gallons of water will be removed from the tank in 6 days. To find out how much water is left in the tank, we subtract the amount removed from the initial amount in the tank:

5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far.

1. **Movies on Friday or Saturday:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Friday or Saturday.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month. So, the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it's a Friday, so he can buy a movie ticket for $10 and a tub of popcorn for $8. The total cost for these is:
\[10 + 8 = 18\] dollars.

Since he has $20 left and the cost for a movie and popcorn is $18, he can afford to see one more movie.

**Final Answer:**
1"
"First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, we calculate:
600 calories / 3 = 200 calories for a mini cinnamon roll.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, we calculate:
450 calories / 3 = 150 calories for a mini blueberry muffin.

Now, we need to find out the total calories for all the mini pastries Andrew baked.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories each = 40,000 calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories each = 45,000 calories.

Now, we add the calories from both types of pastries:
40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

The pastries Andrew baked have a total of 85,000 calories."
"Rita removed Junebugs over 5 days. Let's count how many she removed each day and then find the average.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \]

On Wednesday, she removed the same amount as Tuesday, so:
\[ 78 \]

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.

On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs she removed:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

First, add 39 and 78:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]

Then add 78:
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]

Then add 48:
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]

Finally, add 57:
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, Rita removed a total of 300 Junebugs over 5 days.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days:
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance of bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance of car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled to find out how much farther the bus went:
- Difference in distance = Distance of bus - Distance of car
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie has and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

First, let's add up the toys we know about:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Now, let's add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of known toys from the total number of toys:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls has 14 bouncy balls in it."
"Let's use simple words to solve this problem.

1. Let's say Jean's age is \( J \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) \) which is \( 2J + 10 \).

Now, we know that the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write:

\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Let's add these together:

\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find \( J \):

\[ 4J = 100 - 20 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old.

Now, let's find Paul's age:

\[ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:

\[ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is 50 years.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"First, let's figure out how many balloons Maria's friends got. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the friends got a total of:

4 friends × 2 balloons per friend = 8 balloons

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), they got:

5 people × 3 balloons per person = 15 more balloons

Now, let's add up all the balloons:

Maria's initial balloons: 1
Balloons given by friends: 8
Balloons given by mom: 15

Total balloons = 1 + 8 + 15 = 24

So, the girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes. 

They also have 10 boxes already, so in total, they have \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so to find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table:

\(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need:

\(30 - 15 = 15\) new tables.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet. So, Zoey's total distance is:
40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet. So, Sydney's total distance is:
35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we add Zoey's and Sydney's total distances and then divide by 2 (since there are 2 people):
(400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine makes in a day.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.

Next, we need to find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- In a month, it makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- In a month, it makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets.

Now, we need to find out how much money Fern makes from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Money made = \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Money made = \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, we need to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

- Difference in money made = \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.

First, we calculate the cost for the initial 12-hour stay:
12-hour stay = 1000 pesos

Then, we calculate the cost for the additional hours:
17 hours total - 12 hours = 5 additional hours
5 additional hours * 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for 24 hours, the cost would be:
24-hour stay = 1600 pesos

Now, we find out how much Cameron saved:
1600 pesos (for 24 hours) - 1350 pesos (for 17 hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron saved 250 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. We know that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds. Now, subtract 3 pounds from 10 pounds to find out how much each sheep needs: 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay. So, 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay. So, 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total hay needed: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's find out how much money John earned. He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, we need to subtract the money he spent on gas:

300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that as well:

250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:

5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

So, John can buy 4 pens."
"Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig spelled is:
20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters

Craig's brother spelled words with a total of 50 more letters than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled is:
300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

To find the total number of letters they both spelled, we add Craig's letters and his brother's letters together:
300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650."
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

1. First, we find out how many children are in one school's drill:
   - There are 8 children in each row.
   - There are 7 rows.
   - So, for one school, the number of children is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).

2. Now, we need to find out how many children are in all 5 schools:
   - There are 56 children in one school.
   - There are 5 schools.
   - So, the total number of children is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from the coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles are left for the teacher:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"Patty's Plumbing charges a visit fee of $40. For the labor, it charges $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to calculate the labor cost. 

First, we calculate the labor cost:
- 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Finally, we add the visit fee, which is $40.

So, the total charge is:
- Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
- $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

Patty charged $178.75."
"First, we need to find out how much James paid for the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so for 10 CDs, it would be:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, he gets them for 40% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $150:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the amount he actually paid after the discount is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, he decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Finally, to find out how much money he was out, we subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for all the CDs:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. But the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is $0 because he gained money. 

Final numerical answer:
$0"
"First, we need to find out how much Jen will earn from each type of root crop.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."
"First, we need to find out how far James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake. So, we calculate 60% of 20 miles:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim these 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we divide the distance by his speed:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, James rests for half as long as his swimming time. So, his rest time is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, James has to swim the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, his new speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

So, the time to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times: swimming time, rest time, and the time to swim the remaining distance:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread seven times as many as Sam had last Friday would be. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.

Seven times 70 is:
7 * 70 = 490

The bakery has 40 less than this amount. So, we subtract 40 from 490:
490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

450"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15:

15 - 7 = 8

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to the 8 stickers she has left:

8 + 5 = 13

So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"First, let's find out how much Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5 and he gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, for each copy, he earns:

\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

Since he sells 6 copies, his total earnings from the New York Times are:

\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings from the Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets an 8% commission on each copy. So, for each copy, he earns:

\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

Since he sells 10 copies, his total earnings from the Wall Street Journal are:

\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both newspapers to find the total commission:

\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley earns is:

\[ 15.00 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:

Leo is 42 years old."
"Bahati scored the most points. Let's say Azibo scored \(x\) points. Then, Bahati scored \(x + 20\) points, and Dinar scored \(x + 10\) points.

The total points scored by the team is 45. So, we can write the equation:

\[x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45\]

Combine like terms:

\[3x + 30 = 45\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[3x = 15\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[x = 5\]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to understand how the thickness of the book relates to the number of pages.

1. We know that 100 pages are printed on each inch of paper.
2. The book is 1.5 inches thick.

To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:

\[ 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's find out how many hours Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
15 hours = 15 * 60 = 900 minutes

So, there are 900 minutes in 15 hours. 

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. So, we need to multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he staples in each interval.

60 intervals * 30 reports = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. That's 8 hours of sleep. But she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she was awake before her usual wake-up time from the total sleep time.

First, let's find out how many minutes she usually sleeps:
8 hours = 8 x 60 = 480 minutes

Now, subtract the time she was awake before her usual wake-up time:
5 minutes

And subtract the time she was sleepwalking:
23 minutes

So, the total time she slept on her bed is:
480 - 5 - 23 = 452 minutes

Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, we need to find out how many measuring spoons he has:
- He has 24 cups.
- He has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups.

So, the number of measuring spoons he has is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons:
- He originally had 16 measuring spoons.
- After giving away 6, he has:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
- He has 24 measuring cups.
- He has 10 measuring spoons.

So, the total number of utensils is:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Final answer:
34"
"First, let's find out how many beds are currently occupied. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, we calculate:

1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds

This means 200 beds are currently occupied, and the number of unoccupied beds is:

1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 beds

Now, 50 patients are admitted each day due to the coronavirus outbreak. Over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the number of new patients admitted is:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

These 700 new patients will occupy 700 of the unoccupied beds. So, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

800 unoccupied beds - 700 new patients = 100 unoccupied beds

Final answer:
100 unoccupied beds"
"Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails

The remaining emails are not to family or work, so they are to her boyfriend. The number of emails to her boyfriend is:

9 - 6 = 3 emails

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"Aliya is 3 years old.

Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly said Courtney was wrong by 20%. This means Courtney's number was 120% of the actual number of people.

To find the actual number of people, we can set up a simple equation. If 120% (or 1.2) of the actual number of people is 48, we can find the actual number by dividing 48 by 1.2.

So, we do 48 ÷ 1.2 = 40.

The actual number of people who attended the concert was 40."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. If Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, then Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball (because 2 divided by 2 is 1).

2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 4 balls (because 2 times 2 is 4).

3. Now, let's add up all the balls the three boys carried:
   - Jeffrey carried 1 ball
   - Jason carried 2 balls
   - Jordan carried 4 balls

4. So, the total number of balls is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Let's count the holes step by step.

On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
On the second day, they dug 13 more holes.
On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) - 2 (filled in) = 29 holes.

By the end of the third day, the island had 29 holes.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.

So, four times 10 holes is:
4 × 10 = 40 holes.

This means that on the fourth day, the pirates dug enough holes to make the total 40 holes. Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes at the end of the third day) = 11 holes.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. So, together they got:

70 + 70 = 140 corn chips.

Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so Collins got:

70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips each person got:

140 (Amora and Lainey together) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"First, we need to find out how much the tickets cost. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

To find 50% of $400, we do:
\[ 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \]

So, the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, the total travel cost is $1000."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon (since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe).
3. Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 \) Pokemon (since Alex has caught 5 more than Stan).

Now, we know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon. So, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, let's find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final answer: Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

200 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the distance the bird flies in each direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 22 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we need to find the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes. We start from the northern home and move south, then north, and then south again.

The bird first flies 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, and finally 110 miles south. So, the net distance is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.
At her office party, she got 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
When she got home, there were 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.
So, before the party, Greta had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.
During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.
Therefore, Greta had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \]

So, Nani's sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:
30"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to restring each type of racquet.

For the synthetic gut racquets:
- Andy has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut.
- It takes 15 minutes to string each one.
- So, \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.

For the polyester string racquets:
- Andy has 5 racquets to string with polyester.
- It takes 22 minutes to string each one.
- So, \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.

For the hybrid sets:
- Andy has 4 racquets to string with a hybrid set.
- It takes 18 minutes to string each one.
- So, \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time:
- \(45 + 110 + 72 = 227\) minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total. The first 2 phones are at full price, and the remaining 2 phones are at half price.

The cost of the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The cost of the next 2 phones (at half price) is:
2 phones * $600/phone * 0.5 = $600

So, the total cost for all 4 phones is:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

He paid $1800 for all the phones."
"First, we need to find out how many players are on Zeke's team. We know that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Since Carlton's team has 13 players, we can add 7 to 13 to find the number of players on Zeke's team.

So, 13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20 players on Zeke's team.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

So, 20 (Zeke's players) + 13 (Carlton's players) = 33 players in total.

Final numerical answer:
33"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence he is building. Since the fence is rectangular, we need to add up all the sides.

The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. A rectangle has two lengths and two widths, so we calculate the total length of the fence as follows:

\[ \text{Total length of the fence} = 2 \times \text{length} + 2 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Total length of the fence} = 2 \times 15 + 2 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Total length of the fence} = 30 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total length of the fence} = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find out how many slats he will need:

\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, we need to find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of:

2 (to mom) + 2 (to sister) = 4 boxes

Mrs. Harrington originally bought 12 boxes, so after giving away 4 boxes, she has:

12 (original boxes) - 4 (given away) = 8 boxes left

Now, she kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges for herself. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she kept is:

8 (boxes left) * 20 (oranges per box) = 160 oranges

She kept 1/4 of these oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:

160 (total oranges) * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had after giving some away:

160 (total oranges) - 40 (kept) = 120 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"First, we need to know how many states are in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Now, we need to find half of that number:
50 / 2 = 25

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so:
25 + 4 = 29

Now, we add the number of states in both countries:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, we need to find out how much Tyler needs to buy all the books. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

So, the total cost of the books is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. 

To find out how much more money Tyler needs, we subtract the money he has from the total cost of the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Robert has 30 cherries. Richard has 10 cherries because Robert has 10 more than Richard. 

Now, let's find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert together have 60 cherries. So, if we subtract the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has.

Total cherries: 60
Robert's cherries: 30
Richard's cherries: 30 - 10 = 20

Now, subtract the cherries of Richard and Robert from the total:
60 - 30 (Robert) - 20 (Richard) = 10 cherries for Jerry.

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
Robert's cherries: 30
Jerry's cherries: 10

30 - 10 = 20

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day.

Saturday earnings:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

Sunday earnings:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days:
- Saturday + Sunday: $150 + $315 = $465

Sunny earned $465 for two days."
"Pamela will be outside for 4 hours each day and she reapply sunscreen every hour. So, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.

Over 8 days, she will use:
4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces she will use by the ounces per bottle:

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The blue car costs $100.

The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find out how much cheaper, we calculate 40% of $100:
40% of $100 = 0.40 × $100 = $40

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car:
$100 + $60 = $160

Both cars cost $160."
"Emil will be 24 in 5 years. When Emil is 24, his dad will be twice his age, so the dad will be 48. His brother will be half Emil's age, so the brother will be 12.

Now, let's find out their current ages. If Emil is 19 now, in 5 years he will be 24. So, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old. His brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her:
20 (from mother) + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her:
2 × 20 (from mother) = 40 beads.

Now, let's add all the beads together:
20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had altogether 90 beads."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, so:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so:
\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up all the pounds of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ 21 \div 3 = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate 20% of 30 students.

20% of 30 = 0.20 × 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students.

30 - 6 = 24 students

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate 25% of 24 students.

25% of 24 = 0.25 × 24 = 6 students

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students

So, 12 students are leaving early."
"First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size five, we can calculate Charlie's boot size by multiplying Sophie's size by 5.

So, Charlie's boot size = 5 (Sophie's size) × 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes of their boots and then divide by 2 (since there are two people).

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) ÷ 2
Average size = (5 + 25) ÷ 2
Average size = 30 ÷ 2
Average size = 15

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"First, we need to figure out how many plants can fit in the flower bed. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between plants take up:

111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 - 17 = 27 more flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost for 27 flowers is:

27 * $6 = $162

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. So, we need to find half of 18.

18 divided by 2 is 9.

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

In a week, there are 7 days. So, we need to multiply 9 by 7 to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.

9 times 7 is 63.

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's find out how many petunias and sweet potato vines Katherine needs for one basket.

For one basket:
- Petunias: 3
- Sweet potato vines: 2

Now, let's calculate the cost for one basket.

For one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

Total cost for one basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Katherine has 5 baskets, so we need to find out the total cost for all 5 baskets.

Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 * $14.00 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

To find 25% of $2,000.00, we do:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we divide her yearly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

Final answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. To peel 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many minutes it will take. We do this by dividing 90 by 6.

90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

So, it will take Emily 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. We know that she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to sauté 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 ÷ 30 = 3
3 × 10 = 30 minutes

So, it will take Emily 30 minutes to sauté 90 shrimp.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp.

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

It will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour.
   - For 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour.
   - For 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up 2 degrees per hour.
   - For 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Cooling from low setting: \(+6\) degrees
- Cooling from high setting: \(+12\) degrees
- Warming up: \(-4\) degrees

Total change in temperature:
\[ 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 \]

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14 degrees.**"
"Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 times 30, which is 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

The comet orbits the sun every 75 years. So, the time between the first and second sighting of the comet is 75 years.

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract the 75 years from his age when he saw it the second time.

So, 90 years (age when he saw it the second time) - 75 years (time between sightings) = 15 years.

Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Buford writes checks for the electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks a year.

He writes checks for the gas bill once a month, so that's another 12 checks a year.

He writes checks to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year.

He writes checks to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so that's 4 checks a year.

Now, let's add them all up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in one day.

For the first plane, three-quarters of its flights go to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11 flights.

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
The total howling time for all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 because there are 60 seconds in a minute.
So, 120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we can calculate:

Father's contribution = Mother's contribution × 2
Father's contribution = $6 × 2
Father's contribution = $12

Now, let's add the contributions from his mother and father to find the total amount given to Adam:

Total given = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
Total given = $6 + $12
Total given = $18

Adam bought trousers for $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given from the cost of the trousers:

Adam's contribution = Cost of trousers - Total given
Adam's contribution = $30 - $18
Adam's contribution = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"First, let's find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20. There are 4 children, so we divide the total age by the number of children:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, the average age of the group is 5 years.

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so:

2 × 5 = 10

Helene is 10 years old.

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
- Akbar is 3 years old
- Alessandro is 4 years old
- Helene is 10 years old

To find Wilfred's age, we need to subtract the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the group:

20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"First, we need to find out how much money Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund. 

From his neighbors, Walter collected $500. 
From the online fund, he collected $1500. 

So, the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund is:
$500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. 

So, the lawyer's contribution will be:
3 × $2000 = $6000

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies were brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, we multiply 100 by 15:

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, we need to find half of 1500:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

The church next door gave 750 cookies to each person. Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we need to find out how many people received the cookies. We do this by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. First, let's say each kid gets 1 slice of the watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much, each adult gets 2 slices.
2. So, if we have 2 adults and 4 kids, we need to figure out how many slices in total the watermelon is divided into.
3. Each adult gets 2 slices, so 2 adults get 2 x 2 = 4 slices.
4. Each kid gets 1 slice, so 4 kids get 4 x 1 = 4 slices.
5. In total, the watermelon is divided into 4 (from adults) + 4 (from kids) = 8 slices.
6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets 2 slices out of 8 slices.
7. To find the percentage, we use the formula: (part/whole) x 100.
8. So, (2/8) x 100 = 0.25 x 100 = 25%.

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient. So, the total time for rounds is:

9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time for his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes. So, the total time for appointments is:

10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Now, let's add the time for rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

480 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. If he spends 8 hours on rounds and appointments, the time left for updating his records is:

9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake and then subtract that from 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add all these times together:

20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

If Jordan wants to have the cake ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold together.
2. Then, we can use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find out how many bars are in each box.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
- Together, they sold \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

Step 2: We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.
- So, \(64 \div 8 = 8\).

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"First, let's find out how much it costs for one session. The cost is $25 for renting the studio plus $1.50 per student. With 10 students, the cost per session is:

$25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (per student) × 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40

Now, the dance studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the weekly cost is:

$40 (per session) × 3 (days) = $120

To find the monthly cost, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume there are 4 weeks in a month. So, the monthly cost is:

$120 (weekly cost) × 4 (weeks) = $480

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide 64 by 4:
64 ÷ 4 = 16
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide 56 by 7:
56 ÷ 7 = 8
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's boxes from the number in Peter's boxes:
16 - 8 = 8

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Now, we need to find out how many babies are born in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, we add the number of babies born in a year to the original population to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular shape, so we can find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

The length is 25 feet, the width is 14 feet, and the depth is 4 feet.

So, the volume of the pool is:
25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

So, the number of gallons needed is:
1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

So, the total cost is:
8260 gallons * $0.10 per gallon = $826

The final cost to fill the pool is $826."
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time traveled: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time traveled: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
- Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo
- Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old. Since half of the 3000 students are over 16, we calculate:

3000 students / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

Next, we find out how many of these students are male. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so:

1500 students / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

This means the number of female students over 16 years old is:

1500 students - 375 male students = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Now, let's find out how many students are under 16 years old. Since the other half of the students are under 16, we have:

3000 students / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old.

Half of these students are male, so:

1500 students / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

This means the number of female students under 16 years old is:

1500 students - 750 male students = 750 female students under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 to the number of female students under 16:

1125 female students over 16 + 750 female students under 16 = 1875 female students.

So, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
10 (Bethany's laps) + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
14 (Trey's laps) / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
7 (Shaelyn's laps) - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps:
10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5 laps.

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.

So, Wanda filled:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

Together, they filled:
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

Together, they filled:
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

In total, they filled:
\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining gallons needed to fill the tank are:
\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
\[ 6000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it lost \(3 \times 7\% = 21\%\).
   - Before these 3 hours, the charge was \(28\% + 21\% = 49\%\).

3. **Charge Before First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour.
   - So, in 5 hours, it lost \(5 \times 9\% = 45\%\).
   - Before these 5 hours, the charge was \(49\% + 45\% = 94\%\).

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was **94%**."
"Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, in total, she makes $10 + $15 = $25 an hour.

If she works 40 hours a week, she earns $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a down payment. So, she needs to save 20/100 * $10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by how much she saves each week. So, $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's find out how much Jamaar has spent on the fruits he already bought.

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\)
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10. After buying the fruits, he has:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Now, we need to find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Each plum costs $0.25. So, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"Anne has a box with 15 packs of sweets. Each pack has 60 pieces.

First, we find out how many pieces are in the whole box:
15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so we need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends:
15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Now, we find out how many pieces are in the 13 packs that she gave to her friends:
13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Anne has 10 friends, and she wants to give the sweets equally to all of them. So, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:
780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to increase the original price by 5% each year.

1. **First Year:**
   - Original price: $120
   - Increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * 120 = $6
   - New price after first year: $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - New price: $126
   - Increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * 126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - New price: $132.30
   - Increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * 132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year: $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total. She divided these pictures equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide 72 by 8.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures.

Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. This means there are 3 + 2 = 5 albums that are either selfies or portraits.

Since each album has 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

5 albums × 9 pictures per album = 45 pictures

So, Olivia had 45 portraits and selfies."
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. He reads 18 pages. To find out how long he spends reading, we can set up a simple calculation.

First, we find out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages:
18 pages ÷ 3 pages = 6 sets

Since each set of 3 pages takes 10 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read each set:
6 sets × 10 minutes = 60 minutes

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   15 * 2 = 30 guests.
5. We add these 30 guests to the 61 guests:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

So, the hotel now has 98 guests."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, so he picks 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the bananas John has picked:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult.

Total questions = 60

Easy questions = 40% of 60
                = 0.40 × 60
                = 24

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions. So, we subtract the easy questions from the total questions to find out how many are left for average and difficult questions.

Questions for average and difficult = Total questions - Easy questions
                                   = 60 - 24
                                   = 36

Since these 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we divide 36 by 2.

Average questions = 36 ÷ 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 36 ÷ 2 = 18

Now, let's calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get right.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions right.
Easy questions Aries gets right = 75% of 24
                                = 0.75 × 24
                                = 18

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions right.
Average questions Aries gets right = 18 ÷ 2 = 9
Difficult questions Aries gets right = 18 ÷ 2 = 9

Total questions Aries is sure to get right = Easy questions Aries gets right + Average questions Aries gets right + Difficult questions Aries gets right
                                          = 18 + 9 + 9
                                          = 36

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"First, let's find out how much a large stuffed animal costs. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4 and a large one costs three times that, a large stuffed animal costs $4 * 3 = $12.

Let's say Teresa sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The money from the large stuffed animals is \(x * $12\), and the money from the small stuffed animals is \(2x * $4\).

The total money from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so we can write the equation:
\[12x + 4(2x) = 120\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[12x + 8x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]

Dividing both sides by 20:
\[x = 6\]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones:
\[2x = 2 * 6 = 12\]

Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

12"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to first calculate how many sandwiches each person eats in a day and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day. In one week, he eats:
5 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 35 sandwiches/week

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day. In one week, she eats:
4 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 28 sandwiches/week

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day. In one week, he eats:
2 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 14 sandwiches/week

Now, we add up the sandwiches eaten by each family member in one week:
35 sandwiches (man) + 28 sandwiches (wife) + 14 sandwiches (son) = 77 sandwiches

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80 from the cookies. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240 from the cupcakes. In total, she earned $80 + $240 = $320. She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away 2 * $10 = $20. Therefore, the money she has left is $320 - $20 = $300. 

She has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs in total.

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
30 + 30 = 60 eggs

There were 100 eggs in total, and the Smith twins found 60 of them. So, the number of eggs left for their friends to find is:
100 - 60 = 40 eggs

But it's mentioned that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. So, the friends found:
40 - 10 = 30 eggs

The friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. 

With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, we need to calculate 50% of 12 pounds and add it to 12 pounds.

50% of 12 pounds is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

So, with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe.

First, calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine in 30 days:
\[ 18 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, calculate the amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:
\[ 540 \text{ pounds} \times 40 = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 21600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich first.

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, the price per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. We can check if the price per sandwich is the same:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the price per sandwich is the same in both packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000, so he only needs to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

He has to pay 10% of $2000 each month. To find 10% of $2000, we can divide $2000 by 10.

$2000 ÷ 10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's find out how many red balloons burst. Sally had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. So, we calculate 40% of 25:

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

Now, let's see how many red balloons she has left:

25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

So, she has:

12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch:

75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has:

Red balloons: 15
Yellow balloons: 6
Blue balloons: 6

15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons.

So, Sally finally carried 27 balloons into the school."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the opposite of the scenarios where he doesn't have to turn it in. Let's break it down:

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher.
   - If there's a substitute, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
   - So, the chance of having to turn in his homework with a substitute is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having the normal teacher.
   - There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give an extension.
   - So, the chance of having to turn in his homework with the normal teacher giving an extension is 50% * 60% = 30%.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having the normal teacher.
   - There's a 60% chance the normal teacher won't give an extension.
   - Out of those 60%, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher for an extension.
   - So, the chance of Marcus getting an extension in this scenario is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, we add up the chances of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher scenario: 50%
- Normal teacher with extension: 30%
- Normal teacher without extension, Marcus gets an extension: 6%

So, the total chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework is 50% + 30% + 6% = 86%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 100% - 86% = 14%.

**14%**"
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for guests after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Now, we subtract the seats for graduates and faculty from the total seats to find out how many seats are left for guests.

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

So, there are 4750 seats left for guests.

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive. There are 950 graduates, and the 4750 seats are to be split equally among them.

4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Each graduate receives 5 tickets."
"First, let's figure out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, we can calculate the number of medium-sized jelly beans as follows:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Next, we need to find out how many small jelly beans this is equivalent to. We know that 3 small jelly beans are the same as 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans 150 medium-sized jelly beans are equivalent to, we multiply 150 by 3:

\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

Final numerical answer:
450"
"Melissa works for 6 hours a day for 3 days. So, she works a total of:

6 hours/day × 3 days = 18 hours

She is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, she earns:

$15/day × 3 days = $45

She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, her parking expenses are:

$3/day × 3 days = $9

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to subtract her parking expenses from her total earnings and then divide by the total hours worked:

Total earnings after parking expenses = $45 - $9 = $36

Now, we divide her earnings after expenses by the total hours worked:

$36 ÷ 18 hours = $2/hour

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Ted buys 3 books for $16 each. So, the cost of the books is:
3 books * $16/book = $48

He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each. So, the cost of the pencils is:
3 pencils * $6/pencil = $18

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the books and the pencils:
$48 + $18 = $66

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"First, we need to find out how many soda bottles Richard will place. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he places a bottle every 3 feet, we divide 24 by 3:

24 ÷ 3 = 8 bottles

Now, Richard will drop the candy in each bottle, and it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since he starts at the first bottle, he will need to move to 7 other bottles to drop the candy in all 8 bottles.

So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes for each move:

7 moves × 5 seconds/move = 35 seconds

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. He ordered two boxes, and each box has forty apples. So, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box:

2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples into packs of eight. To find out how many packs he can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, we need to find out how much money Amor spends on the Parmesan cheese. 

The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds of it. So, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 11 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 2 \text{ pounds} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Amor buys 3 pounds of it. So, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Jim borrowed for college. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years. So, the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to figure out how much Jim earned per year before going to college. He earned $25,000 per year. 

Now, let's calculate his income after getting a college degree. His income tripled, so:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

While in college, Jim did not earn any money, so he lost $25,000 per year for 4 years. The total money lost is:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

Now, we need to find out the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay back the loans and the money lost from not working. This total is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since Jim now earns $75,000 per year, we need to find out how many years it will take him to earn $300,000. We do this by dividing the total amount by his annual income:

\[ 300,000 \div 75,000 = 4 \]

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 4 years"
"First, we need to find the size of the fabric Jim needs for one piece. The bed is 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of the fabric will be 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet. The width of the fabric will be 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area is found by multiplying the length by the width. So, for one piece, the area is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2. So, 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]
So, on Tuesday, they delivered:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
So, on Wednesday, they delivered:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the deliveries of each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters Monday - Wednesday."
"To find out the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each pasta salad costs $6.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to get the total amount:
- Total cost = cost of chicken salad + cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is 101 dollars."
"Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $10 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

To find out how much he lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount lost and won, and then divide by the number of races.

Total amount lost: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5.
Total amount won: $11 (second race).

Net loss: $21.5 (total lost) - $11 (total won) = $10.5.

He participated in 3 races, so the average loss per race is $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

**He lost an average of $3.5 per race that day.**"
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people in each city.

1. Number of countries in South America: 26
2. Number of cities in each country: 5
3. Number of people in each city: 1000

Now, we multiply these numbers together:

26 (countries) × 5 (cities per country) × 1000 (people per city) = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, let's find out how tall Xavier is now. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches. So, Xavier is now 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches tall.

Next, let's find out how tall Cole is now. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole is now 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches tall.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now. Cole is 52 inches tall and Xavier is 51 inches tall. So, the difference is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's say the first person took $x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took $x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person took 2 * (x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2 * (x + 80) = 1920

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, we simplify the equation:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Now, divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

So, the first person took $420.

The share of the first one is $420."
"First, let's figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Each painter worked for 3/8 of a day every day. To find out how many hours that is, we need to know how many hours are in a full day. A full day has 24 hours.

So, 3/8 of a day is:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Each painter worked 9 hours every day for 21 days. So, the total hours each painter worked is:
\[ 9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:
189"
"Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is \( x \).

In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls he retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this, first, we need to combine like terms. We can multiply the whole equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Now, we subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls. 

For the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls:
\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008:
- The car's price in 2007 is $20,000.
- The depreciation for 2008 is 21% of $20,000.
- 21% of $20,000 is \( 0.21 \times 20,000 = 4,200 \).
- So, the price in 2008 is \( 20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800 \).

Next, let's find the price of the car in 2009:
- The car's price in 2008 is $15,800.
- The depreciation for 2009 is 21% of $15,800.
- 21% of $15,800 is \( 0.21 \times 15,800 = 3,318 \).
- So, the price in 2009 is \( 15,800 - 3,318 = 12,482 \).

Finally, let's find the price of the car in 2010:
- The car's price in 2009 is $12,482.
- The depreciation for 2010 is 21% of $12,482.
- 21% of $12,482 is \( 0.21 \times 12,482 = 2,621.22 \).
- So, the price in 2010 is \( 12,482 - 2,621.22 = 9,860.78 \).

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we can calculate this by dividing 50 by 2:

50 ÷ 2 = 25

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, let's find out how many books are in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we can calculate this by finding 10% of 50:

10% of 50 = 0.10 × 50 = 5

So, there are 5 German books.

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we need to subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we need to find out how many kilometers she drove in total.

325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 

In 30 days, she drinks:
8 cups/day × 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks:
240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Romeo boards a train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
So, the total number of people on the train becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train.
So, the number of people on the train becomes 140 - 50 = 90.

At the same stop, twice that number boarded the train.
Twice 50 is 100, so 100 more people boarded the train.
So, the total number of people on the train becomes 90 + 100 = 190.

If 80 more people descended at the third station,
the number of people on the train becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's find out how much the running shorts cost. They are $5 more than the tank top, which costs $10. So, the running shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, the tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. So, the sale price of the tennis shoes is $48 / 2 = $24.

The package of athletic socks costs $8, and Alison has a $2 off coupon. So, the socks will cost her $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

So, the total cost is $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out the cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many tiles are needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

Step 1: Determine how many tiles are needed.
- Each tile is 1ft by 1ft, so each tile covers 1 SqFt.
- The kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Therefore, we need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
- Each tile costs $12.
- We need 200 tiles.
- So, the total cost is 200 tiles * $12 per tile.

200 * 12 = $2400

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"First, we need to find out how much the insurance costs after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find 60% of $120, we do:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the insurance cost after the accident is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means the insurance now costs $192 a month.

To find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance."
"Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 

First, let's find out how many twin sheets and king sheets he uses in a year:
- He uses 4 twin sheets per week, so in a year (52 weeks), he uses \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
- He uses 1 king sheet per week, so in a year, he uses \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

Next, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry he does:
- His machine can wash 2 twin sheets at a time, so for 208 twin sheets, he needs \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
- His machine can wash 1 king sheet at a time, so for 52 king sheets, he needs \(52\) loads.

Adding these together, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is \(104 + 52 = 156\).

So, the final answer is:
156"
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they would watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24 movies"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, last year's total was:
100 (from two years ago) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year. So, this year he collected:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, to find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection this year, we add the stickers from all three years:
100 (two years ago) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"Imma feeds her cats 60 grams of cat food per meal, and she feeds them twice a day. So, the total amount of food her cats eat in a day is:

60 grams x 2 = 120 grams per day

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this amount will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food her cats eat per day:

720 grams ÷ 120 grams per day = 6 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices.

Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate:
10 slices - 3 slices = 7 slices

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate:
7 slices × 2 = 14 slices

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
10 slices + 7 slices + 14 slices = 31 slices

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"To find out how many minutes Betsy's part took, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's say Donovan's part took \( x \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( x + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \]

2. Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 2x = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2x = 80 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{80}{2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to 40:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes (which is half an hour, so it's half the hourly rate)
   - $300 ÷ 2 = $150
3. Painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
   - $4 × 30 = $120
4. Parking: $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours
   - $6 × 2 = $12

Now, let's add all the costs together:

- Cast: $200
- Doctor's visit: $150
- Painkillers: $120
- Parking: $12

Total cost: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

The doctor's visit cost total is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. 

20% of 80 emails don't require any response. To find 20% of 80, we do:
\[ 80 \times \frac{20}{100} = 80 \times 0.20 = 16 \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response each day.

Next, we need to find out how many emails James does need to respond to each day. We subtract the emails that don't need a response from the total number of emails:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day.

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday, so 32 x 2 = 64 classes.
On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday, so 32 x 3 = 96 classes.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add all the classes together:
32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

So, in all, 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up all the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 

To find 70% of 20, we do:
20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:
20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. So, the football team ordered:
20 * 2 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. To find 80% of 40, we do:
40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:
40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left

Now, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the pizzas left by the glee club and the football team:
6 + 8 = 14 pizzas

Final numerical answer:
14"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. He wants to send out twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so for 700 small coupons, the cost will be 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost will be 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage total."
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, so now Sidney has:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

6 × 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is:
24 meatballs."
"First, we need to find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had issues, we calculate:

20 trucks ÷ 4 = 5 trucks

So, 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Now, we need to find out how many trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

15 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day: 300 tons."
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next half pound for free.

If he buys 6 pounds of butter, he will get 3 pounds for free (because for every pound he buys, he gets half a pound free, and 6 pounds / 2 = 3 pounds free).

So, he only needs to pay for 3 pounds of butter.

The cost of butter is $4.00 a pound. So, for 3 pounds, the cost will be:

3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

The final cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $12.00."
"First, let's find out how many people are coming to the party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:

25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45 people invited.

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so we subtract those 4 from the total:

45 - 4 = 41 people coming to the party.

The theater charges $125 to rent the theater and $6 for each additional guest. Since 20 people are included in the base fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 people (41 total - 20 included in the base fee):

21 (additional guests) × $6 (per guest) = $126.

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests:

$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

So, the party will cost $251."
"Maggie spent a quarter of her money. So, she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
This means Maggie has:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
This means Riza has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add the amounts:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the two of them have $85 left."
"First, let's find out how many bananas all the monkeys eat in a day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, so we divide 315 by 7 to find out how many bananas they eat each day.

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's find out how many bananas the second monkey eats each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey. Since the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, the second monkey eats:

10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. So, together they eat:

10 + 14 = 24 bananas

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day is 45, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total:

45 - 24 = 21 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, he placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's find out how much Jenny spends on the roses.

Jenny bought 15 roses. If we calculate the cost of 15 roses at $2 each, we get:
15 roses * $2/rose = $30

Now, let's see how much money Jenny had initially and how much she spent:
Jenny had five 5 dollar bills, which is:
5 * $5 = $25

Since the roses cost $30 and Jenny only had $25, she needs more money to buy the roses. She doesn't have enough to buy 15 roses at $2 each.

So, Jenny cannot buy 15 roses with the money she has. She needs $30 - $25 = $5 more.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and Jenny doesn't have enough money to buy the roses, she leaves with all the quarters she had initially.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is $25. Since she didn't buy anything, she leaves with all the quarters she had initially.

Final answer:
Jenny leaves with all the quarters she had initially, which is $25."
"First, let's calculate the money Terry makes from each item:

1. Milkshakes: Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
   So, 6 * $5.50 = $33.00

2. Burger platters: Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
   So, 9 * $11 = $99.00

3. Sodas: Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
   So, 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

Now, let's add up all the money Terry makes:
$33.00 (from milkshakes) + $99.00 (from burger platters) + $30.00 (from sodas) = $162.00

So, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives 10 + 30 = 40 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives 40 + 60 = 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so it arrives 100 + 20 = 120 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will wait for his train, which is the fourth train, to arrive. Since the fourth train arrives 120 minutes after the first train arrives, and the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for 110 minutes."
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, let's find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total. She already has 120 toothpicks. So, let's find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week.

80 toothpicks ÷ 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

8 weeks"
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

To find 75% of $2000, we do:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, we need to find 120% of $1500.

To find 120% of $1500, we do:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800 for the watch.

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch, which is $2000.

The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. First, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours.
2. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
3. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 240 minutes, there are \(240 \times 60 = 14400\) seconds.
4. Now, if one spring creates a jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, one spring would create 14400 jellyfish.
5. If we have 5 springs, and each spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs would be \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\).

So, the final answer is 72000 jellyfish."
"Frankie's score was 15 better more than twice as high as Binkie's score.

First, we find twice Binkie's score:
Twice Binkie's score = 2 * 90 = 180

Then, we add 15 to this amount to find Frankie's score:
Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195

Frankie's score is 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since the total distance is 4 miles). Then he had to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance ÷ Speed

Time = 4 miles ÷ 4 miles per hour

Time = 1 hour

So, it took him 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny gets from the bunches. If each bunch has 4 bananas and she buys 10 bunches, then she gets:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, if Jenny buys these bananas individually, at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

If she buys the bananas in bunches, the cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. We know that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence in total.
2. Harry is getting 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's say Sam gets \( x \) feet of the fence. Then Harry gets \( x + 60 \) feet.

The total fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:
\[ x + (x + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2x + 60 = 100 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how much it grows in 1 year, we divide 8 inches by 4 years:

8 inches ÷ 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:

2 inches/year × 13 years = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

1. Total bikes sold: 300
2. Trekking bikes: Half of 300 = 300 / 2 = 150
3. BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
4. MTB bikes: The rest, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500
2. Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
3. Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500

Finally, let's add up all the earnings to find out how much Marcel earned in total.

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. In 6 hours, the farmer makes:
5 bales/hour × 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. In 6 hours, the truck picks up:
3 bales/hour × 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the bales picked up by the truck from the bales made by the farmer:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's find out how many classes John takes in a week.

John has 6 normal periods and 2 extra classes. So, he takes 6 + 2 = 8 classes in a week.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so for 8 classes, he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in classes from Monday to Friday.

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total class time from Monday to Friday is 320 minutes.

Now, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

First, we need to find out how many minutes he spends in classes from Monday to Friday. We already know this is 320 minutes.

Now, we need to find out the total weekly minutes. Since he spends 320 minutes in classes from Monday to Friday, and the rest of the time is spent on extra learning, we can say that the total weekly minutes are 320 minutes (class time) + 320 minutes (extra learning time) = 640 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on extra learning. He spends 1/16 of his total weekly minutes on extra learning, so:

Extra learning time = 640 minutes / 16 = 40 minutes.

So, the total time he spends learning in a week is 320 minutes (class time) + 40 minutes (extra learning time) = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"First, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. The starting height is 24 feet.

To find the height of the first bounce, we multiply 24 feet by 2/3:
24 feet * 2/3 = 16 feet

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its previous height. So, we multiply 16 feet by 2/3:
16 feet * 2/3 = 32/3 feet

32/3 feet is the same as 10 and 2/3 feet. So, the ball goes 10 and 2/3 feet high on its second bounce.

Final numerical answer:
10 and 2/3 feet"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 10.
2. Then, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find out the total earnings.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
   Number of bags sold = 2000 / 10
   Number of bags sold = 200

2. Total earnings = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
   Total earnings = 200 × $5
   Total earnings = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we can work backwards from the 270 kilograms that were left after the velociraptors and Allosaurus had their share.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors had their share. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex had its meal. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so before the T-Rex ate, there were \(1080 \times 2 = 2160\) kilograms.

So, the triceratops had 2160 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, we need to find the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
Since there are two walls (north and south), the total area for these walls is:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
Since there are two walls (east and west), the total area for these walls is:
40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all the walls to find the total area to be painted:
160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost to paint the room is:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

The final cost to paint the room is $144."
"First, let's see how many sodas are left after Ellen and her brother took some.

Ellen started with 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them and took 1 unshaken soda for herself. So, the number of sodas left is:
12 - 1 = 11 sodas

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So, the number of sodas left after her brother took some is:
11 - 1 - 2 = 8 sodas

Out of these 8 sodas, 2 are unshaken (since Ellen took 1 unshaken and her brother took 2 unshaken), and the rest are shaken:
3 (shaken initially) - 1 (taken by Ellen's brother) = 2 (shaken left)

So, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's friend will get a soda from one of the 8 remaining sodas. The chance of getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
2 (shaken) / 8 (total) = 1/4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
1/4 * 100 = 25%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far each train has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time.

For the first train:
60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train:
30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we add the distances they have traveled.

180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's find out how many days Billy works. 

March has 31 days. From March 1st to April 19th, that's 19 days in April. So, the total number of days is 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, we need to find 20% of 50 days:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

This means Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, Billy helps 240 people."
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 480 \]"
"First, we find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we subtract 4 from 24.

24 - 4 = 20

So, Martha is 20 years old.

Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Since Martha is 20, we add 10 to 20 to find Jeff's age.

20 + 10 = 30

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.

To find the time, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[ \text{Time for biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find the time, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[ \text{Time for second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's figure out how much time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks. So, for the breaks, it's 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the lunch time and the break time together:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

Since Bobby does this every day, we need to find out how much time he spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:
1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"Amber ran 8 miles.

Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so:
3.5 × 8 = 28 miles.

Amber and Micah together ran:
8 + 28 = 36 miles.

The total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. So, Ahito ran:
52 - 36 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's find out how much Sheila had left on her credit card after returning the item. She originally charged $85.00 and returned an item that cost $15.00. So, we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00. A 20% discount means the price is reduced by 20% of $20.00:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, we calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00. A 10% discount means the price is reduced by 10% of $30.00:

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

So, the price of the set of towels after the discount is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on her credit card:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on her credit card is:

$113.00"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color to blue when the UV light is on.
2. We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color.
3. Since 6 jellyfish represent a third of the large jellyfish, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 6 by 3.
4. So, the total number of large jellyfish is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
5. The question states that a fifth of all the jellyfish are large.
6. If 18 jellyfish are a fifth of the total, we can find the total number of jellyfish by multiplying 18 by 5.
7. So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \(18 \times 5 = 90\).

Final numerical answer:
90"
"Chris is 4 years old.

Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is:
2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is:
3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Caroline is 24 years old."
"First, we need to find out how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.

To find 20% of $100,000:
20% = 20/100 = 0.20
0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

So, Lauren saves $20,000 each year.

Next, we need to find out how much money Lauren will have saved by the time she retires in 20 years. We do this by multiplying her annual savings by 20 years:
$20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Now, we need to find out how much money Lauren will need for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary. So, we calculate 40% of $100,000:
40% = 40/100 = 0.40
0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

This means Lauren needs $40,000 each year for her retirement.

To find out how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement, we divide the total amount she needs by her annual savings:
$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save enough for her retirement.

Final answer: 20 years"
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts first.

100 ÷ 4 = 25 centimeters

Each of these parts is 25 centimeters long. Now, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

25 ÷ 5 = 5 centimeters

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"First, we need to find the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. 

To find the total number of students, we can set up a simple equation. If 40% is 240, then 100% (the whole) can be found by:

\[ 240 \div 40 \times 100 = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

To find 60% of 600, we calculate:

\[ 600 \times 0.60 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"My mom bought pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. The total before the coupon is $19 + $26 = $45. She used a coupon for $7 off, so we subtract that from the total: $45 - $7 = $38.

My mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up all the heights and then divide by the number of heels.

First, we calculate the total height of all the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Now, we add these together:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches.

Next, we need to divide this total by the number of heels to find the average:
18 inches ÷ 6 heels = 3 inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

First, let's find out how many miles Soledad plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

Now, let's find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days.

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we subtract the miles she plans to hike from the miles she needs to hike.

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles per day"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total cost for each color of ball and then add them all together.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total cost for red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total cost for blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total cost for green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

Now, we add the total costs for each color of ball to find the total amount received by the store:

- Total cost for red balls: $27
- Total cost for blue balls: $55
- Total cost for green balls: $75

Total amount received: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg:
12 kg / 4 = 3 kg

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg:
12 kg / 3 = 4 kg

Together, Peter and Paul want:
3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg

So, James will have:
12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg

James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then it increased by 3 degrees, so:

-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Raymond started with $21. He saved an additional $11, so he had:

$21 + $11 = $32

Then he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so he spent:

$5 + $19 = $24

To find out how much money Raymond has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he had:

$32 - $24 = $8

Raymond has $8 left."
"Anna started with $16 and has $2 left. So, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 in total. She had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books, so she spent $14 - $4 = $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, each book cost $10 ÷ 2 = $5.

Each of the books cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class.

This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. To find out how many more students that is, we need to calculate 20% of 50.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
20/100 * 50 = 10

So, there are 10 more students this year.

To find the total number of students this year, we add the 10 new students to last year's number:
50 + 10 = 60

Final numerical answer:
60"
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can first figure out how many times it blinks in one minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. So, in one minute, it blinks:
255 ÷ 5 = 51 times

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing 459 by the number of blinks per minute (51):
459 ÷ 51 = 9

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

9 minutes"
"First, let's count the initial number of each type of fish in Tate's pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's add the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's count the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

Final answer: 5"
"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours to do laundry (since ""well over 4 hours"" means more than 4 hours, we can use 5 hours as a simple overage, making it 9 hours in total).

Now, let's add up the time they all took:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

So, they all took 19 hours to do their chores altogether."
"John drives for 2 hours each way, and the speed is 70 mph. To find the distance for one way, we use the formula: distance = speed × time.

For one way:
Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Final numerical answer:
560 miles"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:

10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks in 7 days.

70 miles ÷ 2 = 35 miles

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"First, let's calculate how many toys the first 4 workers produce in one hour.

The first 2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The next 2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the first 4 workers together produce:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate how many toys these 4 workers produce in a 10-hour shift:
\[ 20 \text{ toys per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer needs a total of 400 toys, and after the 4 workers have worked, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order. This means the 4 workers have produced:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the 4 workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces:
\[ 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh altogether 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, and Kris kept 9 for herself. So, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers before giving some to Rob.
2. Luis gave all his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, the 16 stickers Luis had were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

So, Seth had 32 stickers in the beginning."
"First, we need to find out how many ounces of M&M John has in total. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, we multiply 3 by 10 to find the total ounces:

3 * 10 = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total. Since 1 ounce of M&M has 30 M&M, we multiply the total ounces by 30:

30 * 30 = 900 M&M

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag. We divide the total number of M&M by 10:

900 / 10 = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags."
"Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.

Half of the way around the earth is:
40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers:
20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers per day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:
\[ 120 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:
\[ 600 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The faster car goes 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
If Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, then Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.
So, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

9"
"Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah.

First, let's find out how many eggs Sarah painted. If Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the following:

Let's say Sarah painted \( x \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( x + 12 \) eggs. Together, they painted \( x + (x + 12) = 30 \) eggs.

So, \( 2x + 12 = 30 \).

Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2x = 18 \).

Divide by 2: \( x = 9 \).

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline, along with Camden and Sarah, painted 56 eggs in total, we can find out how many Arnold and Madeline painted together:

Arnold and Madeline's total: \( 56 - 30 = 26 \) eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each painted \( 26 \div 2 = 13 \) eggs.

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

So, Camden painted \( 21 - 13 = 8 \) more eggs than Arnold.

Final answer: 8"
"First, let's find out how many groups of crayons Nik can make. Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them into groups of 8.

200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons/group = 25 groups

Now, each group of crayons will be put into a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. So, for 25 groups, we need 25 boxes.

25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 crayons will weigh 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together.

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to convert 400 ounces to pounds.

400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's find out how much of the tree John can use to make logs. He can use 80% of an 80-foot tree.

80% of 80 feet = 0.80 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, John cuts this 64 feet of wood into 4-foot logs. To find out how many logs he gets, we divide 64 feet by 4 feet per log.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96."
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice Valerie's salary, so her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Together, Valerie and her brother earn $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.

45000"
"Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes, we can find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

1 mile on the beach takes:
40 minutes ÷ 2 miles = 20 minutes per mile

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so it takes her half the time to walk 1 mile:
20 minutes ÷ 2 = 10 minutes per mile

Now, we know it takes her 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk for 1 mile. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk:
40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

50 minutes"
"Jane has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks. So, let's find out how much she has saved so far:

$4 per week × 8 weeks = $32

Now, we want to know how many more weeks it will take for her to save a total of $60. First, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take by dividing the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves each week:

$28 ÷ $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

7 weeks"
"First, let's count the blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds. So, 3 trees times 7 blue birds per tree is 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we count the blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds. So, 2 trees times 4 blue birds per tree is 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we add the blue birds in the last tree, which is 3 blue birds.

Now, we add all the blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if we subtract the 24 marbles he receives from the total of 60, we can find out how many marbles he originally has.

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles.

36 - 10 = 26

So, the final answer is:

26"
"Donny can only drink water that is at least 40 degrees. He poured 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and one ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the water from the second mug must have contributed enough heat to reach this temperature.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the bottle, the mixture's temperature must be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces + 1 ounce).

The formula to find the average temperature of the mixture is:
\[ \text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We know the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cows are added by Milkie Cows Limited in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks have 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they bring 20 x 21 = 420 cows.

Now, let's add these cows to the initial number of cows on the farm. Initially, there are 50 cows, so after three weeks, there are 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Next, let's find out how many chickens are added by Broilers Limited in three weeks. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they bring 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these chickens to the initial number of chickens on the farm. Initially, there are 20 chickens, so after three weeks, there are 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Finally, to find the total number of animals on the farm, we add the total number of cows and chickens together. So, 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack has 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, we multiply 9 by 4:

9 bagels/pack × 4 packs = 36 bagels

Next, we need to find out the total cost before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and he orders 4 packs, so:

$10.00/pack × 4 packs = $40.00

Now, Russell gets a 10% discount. To find out the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $40.00:

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 × $40.00 = $4.00

So, the discount is $4.00. We subtract this from the total cost to find the final cost:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the final cost by the total number of bagels:

$36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00."
"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do 23 - 5.

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. The question says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we do 6 - 3 for the potatoes and 3 - 1 for the scoops.

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. So, to find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop, we do 3 ÷ 2.

3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we multiply the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop.

18 × 1.5 = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. So, in 30 days, he eats:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Then, he increases it to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days. So, in the next 30 days, he eats:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, we need to find out how many red jelly beans there are. Jess can see that there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans. Since there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying 17 by 2.

17 (green jelly beans) × 2 = 34 (red jelly beans)

Now, we know there are 17 green jelly beans and 34 red jelly beans. To find out how many blue jelly beans there are, we need to subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = 60
Green jelly beans = 17
Red jelly beans = 34

Now, subtract the green and red jelly beans from the total:

60 (total jelly beans) - 17 (green jelly beans) - 34 (red jelly beans) = 9 (blue jelly beans)

So, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."

"First, we need to find out how many men and women were on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

To find out how many parts the total number of passengers is divided into, we add the numbers in the ratio: 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Now, we find out how many people each part represents by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts: 84 ÷ 14 = 6 people per part.

Next, we find out how many women were on the bus initially by multiplying the number of parts for women by the number of people per part: 9 parts × 6 people per part = 54 women.

If 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract this number from the initial number of women: 54 women - 20 women = 34 women.

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold from the sunflower sales each day. 

Each sunflower costs $2, and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold from the bouquet sales each day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, and he earned $56 from selling bouquets per day. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, let's add the number of sunflowers sold from sunflowers and bouquets each day:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Faraday sold 97 sunflowers each day. After 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 291 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Each rock costs $5, so we divide $100 by $5.

$100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory. To find 60% of 20 rocks, we multiply 20 by 0.60.

20 × 0.60 = 12 rocks

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, we need to find out how much money Adam makes from selling the rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so we multiply 12 by $7.

12 × $7 = $84

Adam makes $84 from selling the rocks.

Adam spent $100 to buy the rocks. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the money he made from the money he spent.

$100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days for each size of picture scenes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the days needed for the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- So, the number of days for large-sized scenes = 45 ÷ 5 = 9 days.

Next, let's calculate the days needed for the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- So, the number of days for medium-sized scenes = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 days.

Finally, let's calculate the days needed for the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- So, the number of days for small-sized scenes = 49 ÷ 7 = 7 days.

Now, we add the days for all the picture scenes together:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. One dozen is equal to 12 eggs. So, three dozen eggs would be:

3 dozen × 12 eggs/dozen = 36 eggs

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. 

In May, there are 31 days.

So, the total cost for one fish in May is:
$1/day × 31 days = $31

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all the fish in May is:
$31 × 3 = $93

Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia started with 30 roses. She gave away 24 roses, so she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then she bought 15 more roses, so she had:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles initially.
- Then, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles.
- So, the total distance is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part of the trip.
- Then, Sid took 3 hours for the second part of the trip.
- So, the total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Multiply the probabilities of winning for both tickets.

First, the probability of winning for the first ticket is 20%, which can be written as 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, we calculate the probability of winning for the second ticket as follows:
\[ \text{Probability of winning for the second ticket} = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we find the probability that both tickets are winners by multiplying the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[ \text{Probability that both tickets are winners} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

They decided to divide all the seashells equally. So, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days. So, for the weekdays, he eats:
4 carrots/day × 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, for the weekend, he eats:
5 carrots/day × 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

So, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how much longer, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
60% of 5 = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus bought each mobile device for $20.

He sold each device for twice the original price, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, he sold each device for $40.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
So, he spent $40 on Monday.

Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]
So, he spent $80 on Tuesday.

In total, he spent:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

He sold all 6 devices for:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \]

His total earnings from selling the devices were $240.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \]

So, Linus earned a profit of $120."
"Isabel is 7 feet tall.
Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

3 feet"
"To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find out how many bottles are needed for 1 person's daily energy needs:**
   - Each juice bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand.
   - To cover 100%, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11,500 bottles.

3. **Determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:**
   - Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total needed: 11,500 - 4200 = 7,300 bottles.

So, Hortex would have to produce 7,300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's figure out how many octuplets are dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple. So, \(8 \times \frac{3}{4} = 6\) octuplets are in purple.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue. So, \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) octuplets are in blue.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. 

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows. So, \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) purple-wearers wear bows.

Now, we know that 2 blue-wearers and 2 purple-wearers wear bows. In total, \(2 + 2 = 4\) octuplets wear bows.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to see how many of the bow-wearers are purple. There are 2 purple-wearers who wear bows out of the total 4 bow-wearers.

So, the percentage is \(\frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\%\).

Final answer: 50%"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
1907 reports

Next, let's add the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
2136 reports

Now, let's add these two totals together:
1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports

The total number of reports received last week is 5168. To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we subtract the total of Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the weekly total:
5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

First, he sells half of his land:
- Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
- He sells this 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sells another 1/4 of his original land:
- 1/4 of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.
- He sells this 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's calculate the remaining land:
- He originally had 80 square meters.
- He sold 40 square meters and 20 square meters.
- So, the remaining land is \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \) square meters.

He sells the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter:
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the remaining land: $60

Total money earned: \( 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \) dollars.

So, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land."
"First, we find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old.

Half of Haley's age is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Geb is 10 less than this amount. So, we subtract 10 from 13.

\( 13 - 10 = 3 \).

So, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, he uses:

2 masks/go out * 3 go outs/day = 6 masks/day

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the original number of eggs: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

So, the final answer is 9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:

200 apartments + 200 apartments = 400 apartments

The third complex is 60% bigger than the 400 apartments, so we need to find 60% of 400:

60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments

So, the third complex has:

400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments

Now, let's add up all the apartments in the three complexes:

200 apartments + 200 apartments + 640 apartments = 1040 apartments

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections in a week is:

1040 apartments * 3 collections = 3120 collections

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total money he makes in a week is:

3120 collections * $0.40 = $1248

So, John makes $1248 in a week."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces \(50 \times 7 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. A 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced over the 10 years:

- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = \(50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550\)

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2550."
"First, we need to find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and she gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

To find 1/5 of $100, we divide $100 by 5:
$100 ÷ 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we need to add the $20 that Sophia gave Jack to the $100 Jack originally had:
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the length of the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's figure out how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's say each of them gave an equal amount of money, \( x \), to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 4/5 \) of her money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - 12 = x \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ 2 \]"
"The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is divided equally among red, white, and purple. This means that red, white, and purple each take up one-third of the other half.

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of that is 6 pints, which is the amount used for yellow paint. The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple. So, each of these colors uses 2 pints of paint.

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2."
"First, let's find the area of one bedroom. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. So, for one bedroom:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \, \text{square feet} + 1200 \, \text{square feet} + 1000 \, \text{square feet} = 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
20% of 100 = 20/100 * 100 = 20 pods

So, the special size box has:
100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

Now, the special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods. We want to know how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

First, let's find out how many pods we get for $1 in the special size box:
$12 for 120 pods means $1 for:
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods

So, for $1, we can get 10 pods. Since we use 1 pod per cycle, we can run:
10 dishwashing cycles

"Thomas starts with $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:

1000 ÷ 20 = 50 bills

Thomas loses 10 bills, so he has:

50 - 10 = 40 bills left

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:

40 ÷ 2 = 20 bills

This means he has:

40 - 20 = 20 bills left

Thomas then triples his money. The value of the remaining bills is:

20 bills × $20 = $400

Tripling this amount gives:

$400 × 3 = $1200

Now, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

$1200 ÷ $5 = 240 bills

So, Thomas has 240 five dollar bills."
"In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. By the end of Monday, he used 45% of the chalk. 

First, we calculate how much chalk he used on Monday:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times 45\% = 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we find out how much chalk is left after Monday:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the chalk left each day if he uses 20% each day:
- Day 1 (Tuesday): 
\[ 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 80\% = 2.75 \times 0.8 = 2.2 \text{ inches} \]
- Day 2 (Wednesday): 
\[ 2.2 \text{ inches} \times 80\% = 2.2 \times 0.8 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on Wednesday.

So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. We know that one-third of the girls are on varsity. Since there are 12 girls, we calculate one-third of 12:

12 girls ÷ 3 = 4 girls on varsity

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. We know that one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Since there are 12 boys, we calculate one-fourth of 12:

12 boys ÷ 4 = 3 boys on varsity

Now, let's find out how many students are on varsity in total:

4 girls on varsity + 3 boys on varsity = 7 students on varsity

To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. There are 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students in total.

24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since the dentist drills 4 teeth, the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, the dentist fixes the teeth that were drilled and the teeth that were capped. So, the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon. So, the refund for 1600 gallons is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. In 7 years, Colin will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
3. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in 7 years, so Wendy's current age is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Now, let's use the second part of the problem:
4. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
5. At that time, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3} \times (C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer: Colin is 20 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. 

To find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy, we divide $27000 by $500:

$27000 ÷ $500 = 54

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. This means he can buy:

54 × 100 = 5400 books

Now, Bob is distributing these books between 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:

5400 ÷ 3 = 1800

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

1800 books per school."
"Let's count the apples step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton picked up 2 apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out. So, Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. Newton picked up these 5 new apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out. So, Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 new apple, making a total of 2 apples.
4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples, which are the 6 that fell out, and went home to make a pie. So, he now has 6 apples in his pocket and 1 new apple, making a total of 7 apples.

"First, let's find out how many slices of cheese pizza Kate's friends eat in total. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, and there are 6 friends. So, we multiply 6 slices by 6 friends:

6 slices × 6 friends = 36 slices of cheese pizza

Next, we calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten. Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and there are 6 friends. So, we multiply 4 slices by 6 friends:

4 slices × 6 friends = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza

Now, we need to find out how many cheese pizza pies and pepperoni pizza pies are needed. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices by 12:

36 slices ÷ 12 slices per pie = 3 cheese pizza pies

For the pepperoni pizza, each pie is cut into 8 slices, so we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices by 8:

24 slices ÷ 8 slices per pie = 3 pepperoni pizza pies

To find the total number of pizza pies, we add the cheese pizza pies and the pepperoni pizza pies together:

3 cheese pizza pies + 3 pepperoni pizza pies = 6 pizza pies

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies."

"Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour. But 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs Jay actually gains in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we can calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in an hour:

60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 intervals

So, in an hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times:

2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour

Now, let's find out how many snowballs Jay actually gains in an hour:

20 snowballs - 8 snowballs = 12 snowballs

Jay gains 12 snowballs in an hour.

To find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the number of snowballs he gains per hour:

60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

5 hours"
"John is 28 years old now. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can assume the current year is 20 years after the show started. If John was twice as old as Jim when the show started, we need to find out how old Jim was then and then add 20 years to that age.

Let's say Jim's age when the show started was \( x \). Then John's age would have been \( 2x \). Since John is now 28, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 20 = 28 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old when the show started. Now, add 20 years to Jim's age at that time:

\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate, we add up the slices:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had:
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 50 bandages
   - Total after first day: 50 - 38 = 12 bandages

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Total after second day: 12 - 28 = -16 (but since they can't have negative bandages, they borrowed 16 from the next pack)

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each and used half a pack. So, they used:
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages
   - Ordered: 50 * 2 = 100 bandages
   - Total after third day: 100 - 25 = 75 bandages (plus the 16 they borrowed earlier)

4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages. So, before the third day, they had:
   - 78 - 16 = 62 bandages

5. To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to add the bandages used on the first day to the bandages they had before the third day:
   - 62 + 38 = 100 bandages

So, they started with 100 bandages on the first day."
"First, we need to find out how much hair was cut off. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. So, the hair cut off is:

10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. The cost per inch of haircut is $30. So, for 2 inches, the cost is:

2 inches * $30 per inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40, to the cost of the haircut:

$60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100

So, the final cost for May's cut and color is $100."
"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. So, in one week, she works:

7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, the total hours she works in April are:

45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from working are:

180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not have any absences, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. So, her total earnings for April are:

$270 + $10 = $280

Final numerical answer:
$280"
"Let's calculate how much money Jason earned for each task he did over the two weeks.

1. For emptying the dishwasher, Jason earned $0.50 each time. He did this 6 times, so:
   $0.50 × 6 = $3.00

2. For doing his laundry, Jason earned $3.00 once, so:
   $3.00 × 1 = $3.00

3. For cleaning his room, Jason earned $1.50 once, so:
   $1.50 × 1 = $1.50

4. For taking the trash to the curb, Jason earned $0.75 twice, so:
   $0.75 × 2 = $1.50

Now, let's add all the money Jason earned:
$3.00 (laundry) + $3.00 (dishwasher) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in total."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, a shark has:

40 gallons * 3 = 120 gallons of blood.

If we have ten sharks, then the total amount of blood is:

120 gallons * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered. So, 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:
2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's find out the cost of one bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so:

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. So, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than scotch. So, the cost of one bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spends a total of 2400 dollars on everything."
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. So, he planted:
- 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted:
- First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
- Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
60 + 80 = 140 trees

140"
"Fred started with 24 gallons of root beer.

- His children drank 4 gallons, so he had 24 - 4 = 20 gallons left.
- His wife spilled 7 gallons, so he had 20 - 7 = 13 gallons left.
- His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so he had 13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. They shared the remaining 8 gallons equally.

So, each person got 8 ÷ 3 = 2 and 2/3 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
2 and 2/3 gallons."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( x \).
2. Four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x \).
3. Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x + 8 \).
4. We know that \( 4x + 8 = 40 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides: \( 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \).
2. This simplifies to \( 4x = 32 \).
3. Divide both sides by 4: \( \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \).
4. This gives us \( x = 8 \).

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Final numerical answer: 8"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:

66 ÷ 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after taking away the fish with red stripes:

66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find out how many of these 44 fish have blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

(5/11) × 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find out how many fish have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

22 + 20 = 42

So, 42 fish have red stripes and blue stripes."
"Amy originally had:
- 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses:
\[1 \times 4 = 4\] colors

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\] colors

Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[26 - 4 - 3 = 19\]

Final answer: 19"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

To find 40% of 700, we do:
\[ 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, we do:
\[ 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:
\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Final numerical answer:
168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since the average is 3 miles per dog and there are 4 dogs, we multiply 3 miles by 4 dogs:
   \[
   3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Next, we add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk:
   \[
   1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need from the total miles all the dogs need:
   \[
   12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we need to find out how much John got from the loan. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

To find 40% of $250,000, we do:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John got a loan worth $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan to pay off his debts.

To find 60% of $100,000, we do:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the money John had leftover after paying his debt is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Let's add these weights together:
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we need to multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram to find out the total earnings.

128 kilograms * $0.50 per kilogram = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"Trinity bought the magazines at $72. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them.

First, we need to find the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

To find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, her profit is $27."
"First, let's find out how much water each setting removes per day:
- Low setting removes 1 liter per day.
- Medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
- High setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed for each setting:
- For the low setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days, so it removed \(1 \times 3 = 3\) liters.
- For the medium setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days, so it removed \(2 \times 3 = 6\) liters.
- For the high setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days, so it removed \(4 \times 5 = 20\) liters.

Finally, we add up all the water removed:
- Total water removed = \(3 + 6 + 20 = 29\) liters.

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons in each pack. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"First, let's find out how much medicine Saanvi uses for one dose.

For one dose, Saanvi uses:
- 14 mL of the first medicine
- 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL

So, for one dose, the total amount of medicine is:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Now, to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

The final numerical answer is:
448 mL"
"Ali's class has 120 students.

John's class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate 1/8 of 120:
120 ÷ 8 = 15 students.

John has two classes, so we multiply the capacity of one of his classes by 2:
15 × 2 = 30 students.

Now, we add the capacities of both schools:
120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's find out how much Stephen will pay in interest. Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. So, the interest is:

\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so:

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return:

\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

\[ 31 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many diapers are used in total for both children each day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, we can calculate the total number of diaper changes as follows:

5 diaper changes/child/day × 2 children = 10 diaper changes/day

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, we need to find out how many diapers that is:

10 diaper changes/day ÷ 2 = 5 diaper changes/day

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is:

5 diaper changes/day

Final numerical answer:
5"
"First, let's find the volume of the jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. So, the volume is:

\[ 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar. Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is:

\[ 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans} \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. So, the difference between his guess and the true number is:

\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"The bus started with 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became:
20 (initial) + 40 (entered) = 60 people.

At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second station is:
3/4 * 40 = 30 people.

Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
60 (previous total) + 30 (entered at second station) = 90 people.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became:
90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the bus's capacity:
200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of people) = 20 people.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"Pauline visits the museum three times a year. In the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2.

First, we calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:
- Cost per visit: $2
- Visits per year: 3
- Years: 5

Total visits in 5 years = 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits
Total cost for 5 years = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. To find the new cost:
- Original cost: $2
- Increase: 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3
- New cost: $2 + $3 = $5

Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years at the new cost of $5 per visit:
- Visits per year: 3
- Years: 3

Total visits in 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits
Total cost for 3 years = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45

Now, we add the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75

Pauline spent $75 on all visits to the museum."
"There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students who can try the escape room. So, there are 4 grades x 10 students = 40 students in total.

If 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students we can make from 40 students.

40 students ÷ 8 students per group = 5 groups

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, if we have 5 groups, it will take:

5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each. So, the total cost for the tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each. So, the total cost for the roof frames is:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the shorter piece is \( x \) feet long.
2. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, it will be \( 4x \) feet long.
3. The total length of the board is the sum of the shorter piece and the longer piece, which is \( x + 4x = 5x \).
4. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so \( 5x = 40 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5: \( x = 40 ÷ 5 = 8 \).

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so it is \( 4 × 8 = 32 \) feet long.

The longer piece is 32 feet long."
"Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. He wants to make 80 meatballs.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of meat he needs:
80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Now, for every pound of meat, he adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So for 5 pounds of meat, he will need:
5 pounds × 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can find the total width by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window.

So, we do:
5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Now, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2.

So, we do:
175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To solve this, we need to break the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - So, for 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

2. The call is 36 minutes long, so after the first 16 minutes, there are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes left.
   - For these 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - So, for 20 minutes, the cost is 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

3. Now, we add the costs of both parts together.
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

So, a 36-minute call would cost $8.00."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches.

Twice of Monday's total rain is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

It is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday, so it will rain 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches on Tuesday.

Final numerical answer:
5 inches"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is \( C \).
2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies \( B \) is \( 3C - 2 \).

Next, we need to figure out the total number of treats. Each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

We already know that \( B = 3C - 2 \), so we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( C \):
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's find out the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35. With a 20% discount, the cost is:
$35 - (20% of $35) = $35 - ($35 * 0.20) = $35 - $7 = $28

The cost of a basic pedicure is $40. With a 20% discount, the cost is:
$40 - (20% of $40) = $40 - ($40 * 0.20) = $40 - $8 = $32

Now, let's add the cost of nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand).

The cost of nail art per finger is $3, so for 10 fingers, the cost is:
$3 * 10 = $30

Now, let's add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art together:
$28 (manicure) + $32 (pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's count the magazines Susan has:

1. She orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each.
2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's count the total number of magazines:

- The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each count as 3 magazines.
- The magazine that sends 6 issues counts as 1 magazine.
- The magazine that sends 24 issues counts as 1 magazine.

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:

3 (from the 12 issue magazines) + 1 (from the 6 issue magazine) + 1 (from the 24 issue magazine) = 5 magazines.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Samantha has 27 paintings.

Shelley has 12 more paintings than Samantha. So, Shelley has:
27 (Samantha's paintings) + 12 = 39 paintings.

Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, Kim has:
39 (Shelley's paintings) - 8 = 31 paintings.

Kim has 31 paintings."
"First, we need to find the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means we add 80% of $40 to the original price.

80% of $40 is:
\[ 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means we take 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

50% of $72 is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January after the decrease is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. 

For the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320

For the 2 lessons with a veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%. So, the reduced rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

For the 2 lessons at the reduced rate:
2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120

Now, we add the amounts from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, we need to count how many quizzes she took. She took 9 quizzes.

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

First, we find out how many pomelos Eve has left:
1/4 of 20 = 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

Now, to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
20 - 5 = 15 pomelos

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples.

To find 2/5 of 60:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

Now, let's find out how many apples are left after giving 9 to his sister:
\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received:
\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 81 \]"
"Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3 quarters (3/4) of the number of novels she wrote this year. To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we can set up a simple equation.

If 9 novels are 3/4 of the total, we can represent the total number of novels she wrote this year as \( x \). So, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. If he travels for 3 days, we need to know how many hours he travels in total. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day, he travels for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we calculate the distance he covers in 72 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of this distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:
Percentage = (Distance Covered / Total Distance) * 100

So, the percentage of the distance covered is:
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60%

Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"First, we need to find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

So, Madeline's brother used 30 grapes.

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes and their mother made 4 pies, we can calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

So, 48 grapes were used to make the pies.

Now, we add up all the grapes used:

\[ 6 \text{ (Madeline's grapes)} + 30 \text{ (brother's grapes)} + 48 \text{ (grapes for pies)} = 84 \]

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning."
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many teachers were not sick. We do this by subtracting the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.
2. Then, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick.

Let's do the math:

1. Total number of teachers: 82
2. Number of sick teachers: 13
3. Number of substitute teachers: 9

Now, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
82 - 13 = 69

Then, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick:
69 + 9 = 78

So, the final number of teachers at school that day is 78."
"First, let's find out how much Bud spends on cheese each week. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount on gruyere cheese. So, for gruyere cheese, he spends:

$3.00 × 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta and the cheese to find out the total weekly cost:

Pasta: $1.00
Cheddar cheese: $3.00
Gruyere cheese: $6.00

Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

Total yearly cost = $10.00 × 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in one day. An 8-hour day is the same as 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many classrooms they can clean in one day. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the number of classrooms cleaned in one day is 480 ÷ 15 = 32 classrooms.

Now, we need to find out how many classrooms they need to clean in total. There are 80 classrooms to clean.

The custodian has 5 days to clean all the classrooms. So, in 5 days, they can clean 32 x 5 = 160 classrooms. Since they only have 80 classrooms to clean, they will finish in less than 5 days.

To find out how many days it will take to clean 80 classrooms, we divide the total number of classrooms by the number of classrooms they can clean in one day: 80 ÷ 32 = 2.5 days.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they will spend cleaning in 2.5 days. Since they clean 32 classrooms in 480 minutes, in 2.5 days, they will spend 2.5 x 480 = 1200 minutes cleaning.

To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we need to know how many minutes are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, so there are 24 x 60 = 1440 minutes in a day.

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is (1200 ÷ 1440) x 100 = 83.33%.

So, on average, the custodian spends 83.33% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's find out how many books each shelf can hold.

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books the middle 2 shelves and the bottom shelf can hold together.

- The middle 2 shelves can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- The bottom shelf can hold 20 books.
- So, the middle 2 shelves and the bottom shelf together can hold \(20 + 20 = 40\) books.

Elly has 110 books in total. If the middle 2 shelves and the bottom shelf can hold 40 books, we need to find out how many more books need to be placed.

- \(110 - 40 = 70\) books still need to be placed.

Now, let's see how many more shelves are needed to hold the remaining 70 books. Since the top shelf can hold 15 books, we need to find out how many top shelves are needed.

- \(70 \div 15 = 4\) with a remainder of 10. This means 4 top shelves can hold 60 books, and we still have 10 books left.

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need an additional shelf for the remaining 10 books. So, we need 1 more shelf.

Now, let's count the total number of shelves needed.

- We already have 3 shelves (2 middle and 1 bottom).
- We need 4 more top shelves and 1 more shelf for the remaining books.

So, the total number of shelves needed is \(3 + 4 + 1 = 8\).

Elly needs 8 shelves to hold all 110 books.

"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs, and one dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs as follows:

5 dozens × 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Next, we need to find out how much Rose spent on the eggs. She bought them for $2.40 a dozen, and she bought five dozens, so:

5 dozens × $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Now, let's calculate how much she will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, we can find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell:

60 eggs ÷ 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

If she sells each set for $1, then her total earnings will be:

20 sets × $1/set = $20.00

To find out her profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings:

$20.00 (earnings) - $12.00 (cost) = $8.00

So, Rose's profit will be $8.00."
"Skyler has 100 hats in total.

First, we find out how many hats are red:
- Half of the hats are red, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats are red.

Next, we find out how many hats are left after taking out the red ones:
- \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats are left.

Now, we find out how many of the remaining hats are blue:
- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 50 hats are blue, so \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) hats are blue.

Finally, we find out how many hats are white:
- The rest of the hats are white, so \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) hats are white.

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that costs $18.00 per bag but there's a $3.00 discount. So, the cost per bag after the discount is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Each bag has 30 sticks of jerky. So, the cost per stick is:

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

$0.50 = 50 cents

Each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"First, let's find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in total to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

To find 70% of 110, we do:
110 * 0.70 = 77 questions

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total to pass.

Next, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
70 * 0.60 = 42 questions

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:
77 - 42 = 35 questions

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's say Mary makes \( x \) strawberry cubes. According to the problem, she makes \( 5x - 4 \) blueberry cubes.

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is \( x + (5x - 4) = 116 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 5x - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6x - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6x = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6x = 120 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, let's find out how many blueberry cubes she makes:

\[ 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many customers Jason needs to get into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers that come into the dealership, one buys a car, we can calculate the number of customers needed as follows:
   - Number of customers needed = 15 cars * 2 customers per car = 30 customers

2. Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers. Since for every 25 telephone calls, he gets one customer, we can calculate the number of telephone calls needed as follows:
   - Number of telephone calls needed = 30 customers * 25 calls per customer = 750 calls

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

750 calls"
"Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights.

There are 8 rooms in the house, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights

In total, they have:
4 flashlights (for people) + 16 flashlights (for rooms) = 20 flashlights

For the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms.

For the small candles:
4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles

For the medium candles:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

In total, they have:
16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using:
20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 candles and flashlights

110 chips ÷ 5 members = 22 chips/member

Each person gets 22 chips."
"John takes 5 minutes for the first side.

For the second and third sides, it takes twice as long as the first side, so:
- Second side: 5 minutes × 2 = 10 minutes
- Third side: 5 minutes × 2 = 10 minutes

For the last 2 sides, it takes half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: 5 minutes ÷ 2 = 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 5 minutes ÷ 2 = 2.5 minutes

The sixth side is the last side, so it also takes 2.5 minutes.

Now, we add all the times together:
5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second side) + 10 minutes (third side) + 2.5 minutes (fourth side) + 2.5 minutes (fifth side) + 2.5 minutes (sixth side) = 32.5 minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we know there are 20 helmets.
2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, we divide the number of helmets by 2:
   \[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
3. The number of helmets is twice the number of footballs. So, we divide the number of helmets by 2 to find the number of footballs:
   \[ \text{Number of footballs} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, let's add up all the items:
- Helmets: 20
- Robots: 10
- Footballs: 10

Total number of items = Helmets + Robots + Footballs
\[ \text{Total} = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 40."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of days in the work week:

24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes for one painting to dry with the old varnish. It takes 7 minutes for one painting.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for one painting to dry with the new varnish. It takes 12 minutes for one painting.

To find out how much longer it takes for 6 paintings with the new varnish, we need to do the following:

1. Find out how long it takes for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Find out how long it takes for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish.

For 6 paintings with the old varnish:
7 minutes × 6 = 42 minutes

For 6 paintings with the new varnish:
12 minutes × 6 = 72 minutes

Now, we subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish:
72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish."
"First, let's find out how much water the 4 plants that need half a cup each will use. We do this by multiplying the number of these plants by the amount of water each needs:

4 plants * 0.5 cup/plant = 2 cups

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:

8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we know that 4 + 8 = 12 plants have been accounted for. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup each is:

20 plants - 12 plants = 8 plants

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each, so we calculate the total water needed for these plants:

8 plants * 0.25 cup/plant = 2 cups

Finally, we add up all the water needed for all the plants:

2 cups (for the half-cup plants) + 8 cups (for the 1-cup plants) + 2 cups (for the quarter-cup plants) = 12 cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"Phineas Frog needs to travel 200 yards in total. Half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water.

First, we find half of 200 yards:
200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

So, Phineas will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey.

For hopping on land:
Speed = 20 yards per minute
Distance = 100 yards
Time = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For swimming in water:
Speed = 10 yards per minute
Distance = 100 yards
Time = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Now, we add the time for both parts of the journey:
5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

Final answer: 15"
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and costs $2.00.

First, we need to find out how many boxes Bob needs:
56 popsicle sticks ÷ 8 popsicle sticks per box = 7 boxes

Now, we calculate the total cost:
7 boxes × $2.00 per box = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20. Each additional phone costs half of the main phone, so each additional phone costs $20 ÷ 2 = $10.

There are 5 phones in total, and one of them is the main phone, so there are 5 - 1 = 4 additional phones.

The cost of the 4 additional phones is 4 × $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, so it is $20 + $40 = $60.

The whole phone plan costs $60."
"First, let's figure out how many doughnuts Derrick makes each day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 10 dozen doughnuts equal 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts.

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. So, if he sells all 120 doughnuts, he makes 120 x $2 = $240 each day.

Now, let's find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June. So, $240 x 30 = $7200.

Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, she uploads \(7 \times 6 = 42\) photos each day.

She has 210 photos in total. To find out how many days she needs to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day.

So, \(210 \div 42 = 5\).

Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"Alicia drops off 5 blouses each week. The cost for the blouses each week is:
5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00

She also drops off 2 pairs of pants each week. The cost for the pants each week is:
2 pants * $8.00/pant = $16.00

And she drops off 1 skirt each week. The cost for the skirt each week is:
1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

So, the total cost for one week is:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirt) = $47.00

If she does this for 5 weeks, the total cost is:
$47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, we need to find out John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster. So, we calculate his new speed as follows:

150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. He needs to speak 10 pages, and each page has 450 words. So, we calculate the total words as follows:

10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. There are 4 days, so:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping of the popcorn step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party and an extra gallon that is twice as tart. So, he needs to make a total of 5 gallons of lemonade.

For 1 gallon of lemonade, he needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. Therefore, for 5 gallons, he needs 5 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 5 cups of juice, he will need:
6 lemons/cup × 5 cups = 30 lemons

So, Tim will need 30 lemons.

30 lemons"
"First, let's find out how much food the German Shepherds need in a day. There are 3 German Shepherds and each one eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total for the German Shepherds is:

3 German Shepherds × 5 kilograms = 15 kilograms per day

Next, let's find out how much food the Bulldogs need in a day. There are 2 Bulldogs and each one eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total for the Bulldogs is:

2 Bulldogs × 3 kilograms = 6 kilograms per day

Now, let's add the food needed for both types of dogs per day:

15 kilograms (for German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (for Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms per day

To find out how much food they need in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

21 kilograms per day × 7 days = 147 kilograms

So, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's count the legs from the 2-legged animals. There are 10 of them, so:
10 animals * 2 legs each = 20 legs

Next, let's count the legs from the 4-legged animals. There are 15 of them, so:
15 animals * 4 legs each = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs from both types of animals:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

So, the total number of legs on the farm is 80.

Final numerical answer:
80"
"The tower has 4 blue blocks.

There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) yellow blocks.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is \(4 + 8 = 12\).

If there are 32 blocks in total, and 12 of them are blue and yellow, then the number of red blocks is \(32 - 12 = 20\).

So, there are 20 red blocks.

20"
"Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, the distance he travels west is:
5 hours * 18 miles/hour = 90 miles

Then, he drives east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, the distance he travels east is:
8 hours * 18 miles/hour = 144 miles

To find out how far he is from his house, we need to subtract the distance he traveled east from the distance he traveled west:
144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"Gary bought the boat for $9000.

After the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%. So, the boat's value after the first year is:
$9000 - (30% of $9000) = $9000 - ($9000 * 0.30) = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

After the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. So, the boat's value after the second year is:
$6300 - (30% of $6300) = $6300 - ($6300 * 0.30) = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

After the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. So, the boat's value after the third year is:
$4410 - (20% of $4410) = $4410 - ($4410 * 0.20) = $4410 - $882 = $3528

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bag has 54 red candies.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
   \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) orange candies.
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
   \( 54 \div 2 = 27 \) yellow candies.
4. Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
   \( 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \) candies.
5. The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
   \( 232 - 189 = 43 \) pink candies.

So, the final answer is:
43 pink candies."
"First, we need to find out how much Helen paid for one night at the hotel. The cost for one night is $80.

Next, we need to find out how much Helen paid for one bus trip. Since each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, we calculate:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]
So, each bus trip costs $8.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the hotel stay. Helen stayed for 3 nights, so:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]
So, the total cost for the hotel stay is $240.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, so:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]
So, the total cost for the bus trips is $56.

Finally, we add the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 296 \]"
"Mazie originally had 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4. So, before dropping the marbles, Dallas must have had:

21 marbles (after dropping) + 4 marbles (dropped) = 25 marbles

Since Mazie gave marbles to both Dallas and Darla, and Dallas had 25 marbles, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

52 marbles (total given by Mazie) - 25 marbles (given to Dallas) = 27 marbles

Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"First, we need to find out the cost of the tickets. There are 2 adults and 1 child.

The cost for the adults' tickets is:
2 adults * $12/adult = $24

The cost for the child's ticket is:
1 child * $8/child = $8

Now, we add the cost of the popcorns:
2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

Finally, we add all the costs together:
$24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

So, they pay a total of $38."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01 (which is the decimal form of 1%).

1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

So, John needs to push with a force of 16 pounds to move the car."
"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The fence is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"Mia is 40 years old.
Emma is 16 years older than Mia, so Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.
To find the average of their ages, we add Mia's age and Emma's age and then divide by 2.
So, (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48.
The average of their ages is 48."
"First, we need to find out the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny. 

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

To find the total, we add these numbers together:
214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found. They found 67 cracked seashells.

So, we subtract the cracked seashells from the total:
732 - 67 = 665 good seashells.

The final numerical answer is:
665"
"Avery needs to buy 3 place settings for each of the 12 people. Each place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

First, let's calculate the cost of one place setting:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

So, the cost of one place setting is:
$6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

Now, Avery needs 12 place settings, so we multiply the cost of one place setting by 12:
$15.00 × 12 = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle.

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so Anna took 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, each pig eats:

4 pounds × 2 = 8 pounds a day.

Dexter has 5 pigs, so all together, they eat:

8 pounds × 5 = 40 pounds a day.

Now, let's find out how much feed they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

40 pounds × 7 = 280 pounds in a week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, the answer is 20 pounds of feed left after a week."
"First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, we multiply 20 by 2:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. So, we subtract these from the total needed:

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

Each pack costs $2. So, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find out how much John needs to spend:

6 packs * $2/pack = $12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's find out how much money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For cupcakes:
- She sells 20 cupcakes.
- Each cupcake is sold for $2.
- So, the total money from cupcakes is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

For cookies:
- She sells 40 cookies.
- Each cookie is sold for $1.
- So, the total money from cookies is \(40 \times 1 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's add the money from cupcakes and cookies:
- Total money from cupcakes and cookies is \(40 + 40 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much money Frances spends on trays:
- She buys 5 trays.
- Each tray costs $4.
- So, the total cost for trays is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Frances has left:
- Money left is the total money from cupcakes and cookies minus the cost of trays.
- So, the money left is \(80 - 20 = 60\) dollars.

Therefore, Frances has 60 dollars left."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first street, there are 5 children following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, 5 children each get 1 more, which means 5 + 5 = 10 children.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. So, 10 children each get 2 more, which means 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 children.
4. The original 5 children then leave, so we subtract 5 from 30.

Final number of children following the truck: 30 - 5 = 25

25"
"Mamou gave out meals over three days. Let's add up the meals she gave out:

- On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
- On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
- On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Mamou started with 1,360 meals. To find out how many meals she has left, we need to subtract the meals she has already given out from the total number of meals:

1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"James found a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 × 5 = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 × 10 = 70 cents.

Now, let's add them up:
25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents."
"The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so he is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

The total age of the sisters is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of all the siblings is 16 (younger sister) + 24 (older brother) + 16 (another sister) + 16 (another sister) + 16 (last sister) + 12 (younger brother) = 100 years.

So, the total age of all these siblings is 100 years."
"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes of meditation each day. 

In a week, she meditates for 30 minutes x 7 days = 210 minutes.

Before yoga, we need to calculate the yoga time. She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, she practices 60 minutes x 5 days = 300 minutes of yoga in a week.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga in a week: 210 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 510 minutes.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 510 minutes x 4 = 2040 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:
2040 minutes"
"To find out how many square feet the quilt will be, we need to calculate the total fabric from each type of shirt and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the fabric from the small shirts:
- Each small shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small shirts.
- So, the total fabric from small shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate the fabric from the medium shirts:
- Each medium shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium shirts.
- So, the total fabric from medium shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Then, let's calculate the fabric from the large shirts:
- Each large shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large shirts.
- So, the total fabric from large shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add all the fabric together:
- Total fabric = fabric from small shirts + fabric from medium shirts + fabric from large shirts
- Total fabric = \(33 + 32 + 36 = 101\) square feet.

So, the quilt will be 101 square feet."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. One dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. 50% of 36 is 0.50 x 36 = 18 seeds.

So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Altogether, there are 36 seeds from the small sunflower and 54 seeds from the large sunflower.

36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

Final numerical answer: 90 seeds."
"George has 18 pens.

Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, so Timothy has \(18 \times 3 = 54\) pens.

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has \(54 \div 2 = 27\) pens.

Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Albert is 36 inches tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is:

\[ 36 \times 2 = 72 \text{ inches tall} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. So, before the summer, Jackie was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer."
"The company produces 5000 bars of chocolate each day. 

In one week, there are 7 days. So, in two weeks, there are 7 x 2 = 14 days.

If the company produces 5000 bars each day, then in 14 days, it will produce 5000 x 14 = 70,000 bars.

The company sells each bar for $2. So, for 70,000 bars, the company will receive 70,000 x $2 = $140,000.

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.50 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.40 = $16.

So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

The total amount is $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Ryan gets $6 each week for doing chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned:

$6 x 3 = $18

Ryan then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

$1.25 x 4 = $5

After buying the ice cream, Ryan has:

$18 - $5 = $13

Now, they all want to go to the movies, and each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one movie ticket:

$13 ÷ $6.50 = 2

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, Lani spent $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

To find out how much they spent in all, we add Ellen's and Lani's expenses together: $105 + $230 = $335.

They spent $335 in all."
"First, let's find out how much it costs to make one jar of the honey and jam mix.

For the passion fruit:
2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12

For the jackfruit:
1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12

For the honey:
2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20

Now, let's add up the costs for one jar:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

So, it costs $44 to make one jar.

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the profit for one jar is:
$50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6

If he sells 10 jars, the total profit is:
$6 (profit per jar) * 10 jars = $60

Final numerical answer:
$60"
"First, let's find out how much each type of coin is worth in dollars.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   - So, the total value of quarters is \(32 \times 0.25 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   - So, the total value of dimes is \(95 \times 0.10 = 9.50\) dollars.

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   - So, the total value of nickels is \(120 \times 0.05 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   - So, the total value of pennies is \(750 \times 0.01 = 7.50\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the values to find the total dollar amount in the jar.

- Total value = Value of quarters + Value of dimes + Value of nickels + Value of pennies
- Total value = $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $29 + $16.50 = $45.50

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is $45.50."

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday to Friday and Saturday). He services 3 cars each day. So, in one week, he services:

3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week

He gets paid $4 per car, so in one week, he makes:

15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week

In 2 weeks, he makes:

$60/week * 2 weeks = $120

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Randy starts with:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

First, he ate 3 cookies, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

Next, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

Then, he gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

After that, he baked 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Randy has 23 cookies now."
"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half, he would get $5 per toy. So, for 6 toys, he would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, he would get $7 per toy. So, for 6 toys, he would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

If Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72."
"First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug is:

6 holes/day × 14 days = 84 holes

Now, Nate starts filling holes. He fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes net filled per day

To find out how many days it takes to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

84 holes ÷ 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

28 days ÷ 7 days/week = 4 weeks

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of students at Norman High School by 3/4.

Norman High School's average enrollment = 4000 students

Butler High School's average enrollment = 4000 students * 3/4

Now, let's do the multiplication:

4000 * 3/4 = 4000 * 0.75 = 3000 students

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students.

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

4000 students (Norman High School) - 3000 students (Butler High School) = 1000 students

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 (rainbow cookies) + 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 5670 cookies

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of cookies:
7995 (total cookies) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal cookies) = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

2325"
"Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ test tubes} \]

Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, so Igor gathered:
\[ 14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes} \]

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor gathered as \( x \).

The total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. So we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides:
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor gathered 5 beakers. Since he was supposed to gather 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, we need to find out how many screws James needs in total. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, he needs:

4 legs × 2 screws per leg = 8 screws

Since James is putting together 4 tables, we multiply the number of screws needed for one table by 4:

8 screws per table × 4 tables = 32 screws

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws he uses from the total number of screws he has:

40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket.

The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 10 x 2 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the eggs from both baskets together: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ 430 + 320 = 750 \]
Kim raised $750.

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]
Maryam raised $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Vanessa ran 4 miles. Aaron ran half the distance, so he ran 2 miles. Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron was twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa took twice as long to run the same distance. 

So, Vanessa took \(16 \times 2 = 32\) minutes to complete her 4 miles.

Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part."
"The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There are 200 feet of dock.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed:
200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line.

He already has 6 feet of new line.

Now, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line.

So, he needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's find out how much they spend on meals and wine for one night.

For meals, they order 2 meals each night, and each meal costs $5. So, the cost for meals per night is:
2 meals * $5/meal = $10

For wine, they order 1 bottle at $5 each night. So, the cost for wine per night is:
1 bottle * $5/bottle = $5

Now, let's add the cost of meals and wine to find the total cost per night:
$10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we need to find out the total cost for 2 days:
$15/night * 2 nights/week = $30/week

So, the final numerical answer is:
$30"
"First, we need to find out how much the vendor made from selling each watermelon. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost per watermelon is:
$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.

25% of $1.60 is:
0.25 × $1.60 = $0.40

So, the selling price per watermelon is:
$1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

Each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's find out Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19. So, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32. So, his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"First, let's figure out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, we divide 60 by 3 to find out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
60 ÷ 3 = 20 oranges

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. So, we divide 60 by 4 to find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
60 ÷ 4 = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane in an hour. We subtract the number of oranges Jane can peel from the number of oranges Ana can peel:
20 - 15 = 5 oranges

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's find out how much the radiator costs after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. 

To find 80% of $400, we do:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the radiator costs $320 after the discount.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

To find the total cost for the mechanic, we do:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the mechanic charges $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost for the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is $470."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.
2. Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total.
3. These animals have 70 legs in total.

Let's use some simple math to find out how many chickens there are.

First, let's say all 20 animals are chickens. That would mean:
20 chickens * 2 legs each = 40 legs

But we know the animals have 70 legs in total. So, we need to find out how many more legs we need:
70 legs - 40 legs = 30 extra legs

Now, each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken (4 legs - 2 legs = 2 extra legs). So, to get the 30 extra legs, we need:
30 extra legs / 2 extra legs per cow = 15 cows

So, there are 15 cows. Since there are 20 animals in total:
20 animals - 15 cows = 5 chickens

So, the final answer is:
5 chickens"
"First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices by multiplying 7 by 8.

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. This means the slices will be shared among 4 people.

56 slices ÷ 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each of them can have 14 slices of pizza."
