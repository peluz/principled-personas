"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% on $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house after the repairs is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3. Since every second glass is at the reduced price, for 16 glasses, 8 glasses will be at the full price and 8 glasses will be at the reduced price.

Calculate the total cost for the glasses at the full price:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Calculate the total cost for the glasses at the reduced price:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Add these two amounts to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston = \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \( 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \).

The final numerical answer is:
260"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.

40% of 200 GB is:
\[ 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB again.

The time to download the entire 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for the initial 40% download, the restart, and the full download again, the total time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to calculate the distance John covers on his way back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time of 4 hours minus the 2 hours in standstill traffic and the 0.5 hours of driving at 30 mph. The remaining time is:

\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]

During this time, he drives at a speed of 80 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance he covers on his way back home is:

\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the final total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual expenses:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

To find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90, we set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} \times \text{number of years} = \text{Initial cost}
\]
\[
\$7.5 \times \text{number of years} = \$90
\]

Solving for the number of years:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house, and thus she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option based on the speculated market increases.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, as it yields a higher profit of $125.

**Final Answer:**
$125"

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Since both trains follow the same route and travel the same distances, we can calculate the total distance for one train and then state the result for the other train.

**Total distance for one train:**
- Distance traveled westward: 80 miles
- Distance traveled northward: 150 miles

Adding these distances together:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230 \text{ miles}} \]"

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance and the total time required for the hike:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total time required = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   - Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Determine the remaining time needed to complete the hike:**
   - Remaining time = Total time required - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

**Final numerical answer:**
6 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond when his son was born is 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years ago} \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price Kyle paid.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."

3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio of 7:11. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the total of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for one dog.
2. Calculate the daily care time for all 10 dogs.
3. Calculate the weekly care time for all 10 dogs.

Step 1: Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 2: Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. Since the yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the calculation confirms the money spent and the leftover, we now need to determine how many lego sets he still has. The problem states that he sold all his lego sets initially, so he no longer has any lego sets left.

Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - John runs half as much on the other two days as he does on the first day.
   - Distance on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days = \( 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - Time on the first day = 3 hours.
   - Time on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3}{2} \) hours.
   - Total time on the other two days = \( 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \) hours.
   - Total time = \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) hours.

5. **Average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = \( \frac{6v}{6} = v \) miles per hour.

6. **Determine \( v \):**
   - We know the total distance run in a week is 60 miles.
   - Therefore, \( 6v = 60 \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance covered while running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance covered while walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s, then Ben’s iPhone is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone, Brandon’s iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine how many pieces were taken by the guests by subtracting the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:

2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories remaining.

Next, we need to find out how many calories each serving of chips contains:

250 calories per serving.

Now, we calculate how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can find out how many grams correspond to 0.8 servings:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Finally, we calculate how many grams of chips can be eaten with 0.8 servings:

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

**Final Answer:**
104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

First, let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She then used 220 Post-it notes at work, leaving her with 23 Post-it notes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys need to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's revenue ($480), we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:

$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday.

Final numerical answer:
$40"
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Adopted Kittens:**
   - The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

2. **Kittens Born to House Cats:**
   - Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.
   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Kittens:**
   - Add the adopted kittens to the kittens born to the house cats:
     \[
     7 \text{ (adopted kittens)} + 21 \text{ (Patchy's kittens)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie's kittens)} = 40
     \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is **40**."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving her with \(30 - 2 = 28\) lollipops. If Jean packages 2 lollipops in one bag, the number of bags she can fill is \(28 \div 2 = 14\).

Therefore, Jean can fill \(\boxed{14}\) bags."

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two components of her pension: the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% of the value of the pension based on her years of service.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension**: Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension based on her years of service.

2. **Additional Pension Component**: Starting after 20 years, for each additional year of service, she gets an additional 5% of the value of the pension. Since she quits after 30 years, she has 10 additional years of service beyond the initial 20 years.

The value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000. For each additional year, she gets 5% of $50,000.

- For the 21st year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 22nd year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 23rd year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 24th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 25th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 26th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 27th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 28th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 29th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)
- For the 30th year: \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\)

Adding these additional amounts to the fixed annual pension:

\[50,000 + 10 \times 2,500 = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000\]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $75,000.

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and apply the given conditions.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the amounts for the first and second halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information provided.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the fuel efficiency we just calculated:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people sent.
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

Therefore, Bailey started with \(\boxed{60}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. That's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (Top Level):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 3:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 2:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 1 (Bottom Level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ 7.5 \]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then determine how many bags that amount corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's define the amount of laundry each person does in terms of a variable.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.

According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is:
\[ 4D \]

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 4D = 400 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]

Now, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost with packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost with packages of 2: $9.00

The difference in cost, which represents the savings, is:
\[ 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is directly proportional to the duration).

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster, which is equivalent to running 90% of his original time (since 100% - 10% = 90%).

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can result in 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans were used by dividing the total amount of sauce by the amount of sauce per can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces of sauce}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total cars originally on the motorway**: 30 cars.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars.
3. **Cars that remained in the traffic jam**: \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars.

Since the total number of cars that remained in the traffic jam is 25, and 20 of them drove through in the last 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes} = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away:

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away:

The number of potted plants she will have left is the total number of potted plants she already has minus the number of potted plants she will give away:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday to the number of plants she will have left after giving some away:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

6 pages per day"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height.

The inner volume of one box is:
\[3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so \(x\) episodes would be \(0.5x\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total hours of TV watched:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7\]

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we add the number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice to find the total number of roll-ups eaten:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, we need to determine how far Julia needs to row to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance to the shore as follows:

\[
\text{Distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}

"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per teacher per day**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Whiteboard usage per lesson**: Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each of their lessons.
4. **Cleanings per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day for all teachers combined:
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Lessons per teacher per day} \]
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = \text{Total lessons per day} \times \text{Cleanings per lesson} \]
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Prices have increased by 50%.
   - New price per board = \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board = \( \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

3. **Total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Selling price of 2x4x10 boards + Selling price of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total selling price = \$150 + \$120 = \$270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

1. **Profit:**

   - Profit = \$270 - \$180 = \$90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10

3. Subtract the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining number.

Let's start with the first step:

1. A third of the 60 elves quit after children vomit on them:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.

2. Subtract the 20 elves who quit from the initial 60 elves:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 elves remain.

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the final number of elves left is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure for June.

1. Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.
2. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so we subtract $60 from $500 to find his June expenditure:
   \[
   500 - 60 = 440
   \]
   Therefore, Joseph's expenditure in June was $440.

3. To find the total expenditure for both months, we add the expenditures of May and June:
   \[
   500 + 440 = 940
   \]

Thus, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of \(2 + 2 = 4\) rides.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) rides.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred combined:

- Total rides = Pam's rides + Fred's rides = \(4 + 6 = 10\) rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:

- Total tickets = Total rides \(\times\) Tickets per ride = \(10 \times 6 = 60\) tickets.

Therefore, they used 60 tickets that day."
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

Step 1: Monthly cost of car washes
Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15.
So, the monthly cost is \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.

Step 2: Annual cost
There are 12 months in a year, so the annual cost is \(60 \times 12 = 720\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Brian now has 15 video games. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

40"
"First, we determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- Cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each: \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
- Cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)
- Cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee on the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[29.00\]"
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

**First Test:**
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions left incomplete in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

**Second Test:**
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions left incomplete in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

**Total Questions Left Incomplete:**
\[ \text{Total questions left incomplete} = \text{Questions left incomplete in the first test} + \text{Questions left incomplete in the second test} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for supplies per client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest:**
   - There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - John has 10 hectares.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is \(100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}\).

2. **Determine the number of harvests in a year:**
   - John can harvest every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \(12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - Each harvest yields 1000 pineapples.
   - There are 4 harvests in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is \(1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples}\).

**Final Answer:**
4000 pineapples"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the previous 12 hours (30 + 60) minus the bees that returned in the first 12 hours (15) plus the bees that left in the last 6 hours (60).

   - Total bees that left in the first 12 hours: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees
   - Bees that returned in the first 12 hours: 15 bees
   - Bees that left in the last 6 hours: 60 bees

   - Bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 90 - 15 + 60 = 135 \) bees

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **135**."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Time difference: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for 4 minutes.

The final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people had both tires inflated, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people had all their tires inflated, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For a unicycle, there is 1 tire. Since 1 person had their tire inflated, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
- Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains 6 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with $10.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).
5. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Adding 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
Adding 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

1. **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
   - Each day, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
   - Total hours per day = 3 classes * 1 hour/class = 3 hours.
   - Since there are 3 days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), the total for these days = 3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours.

2. **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
   - Each day, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
   - Total hours per day = 2 classes * 2 hours/class = 4 hours.
   - Since there are 2 days (Tuesdays and Thursdays), the total for these days = 2 days * 4 hours/day = 8 hours.

3. **Total weekly hours:**
   - Adding the hours from all days, we get 9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TT) = 17 hours per week.

4. **Total semester hours:**
   - There are 16 weeks in the semester.
   - Total hours in the semester = 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

1. **Rolls**: Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
   \[
   300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
   \[
   120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Baguettes**: Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is 24 inches long.
   \[
   60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we sum the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
\frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\).

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\).

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\).

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[
200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:
\[
3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

11 (initially visible) + 6 (coming out) = 17 tadpoles.

However, then 2 of them hide under a rock, which means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is 15."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price = $20
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase every two months:**
   - Increase every two months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months = 36 / 2 = 18

4. **Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months:**
   - Total increase = Increase every two months * Number of two-month periods
   - Total increase = $4 * 18 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months:**
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92."
"Given:
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- An action figure costs $5.

First, let's determine the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The cost of 3 action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The cost of the doll is 15 dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 per hour for 3 hours.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference in money:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she saves the $105 in lost income.
   - However, she has to pay the accountant $90.
   - Net difference = $105 (saved income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

1. The cost of the computer is €1090.
2. The cost of the screen is €157.
3. The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
4. The cost of the CD burner is €74.
5. The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 74 = 1395 \]
\[ 1395 + 102 = 1497 \]

So, the total cost of the items is €1497.

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into this equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
For 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We add the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
2. The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = \$6000 \]

Now, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = \$6000 - \$1200 = \$4800 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one dozen cups. Since twenty dozen cups cost $4800, the cost of one dozen cups is:
\[ \text{Cost of one dozen cups} = \frac{\$4800}{20} = \$240 \]

Finally, to find the cost of one cup, we divide the cost of one dozen cups by 12:
\[ \text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{\$240}{12} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she mows the lawn is \(10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\) dollars.

To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to set up the equation where the total amount of money she has is equal to the total cost of the items:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[4x = 70 - 30\]
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4}\]
\[x = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her hourly wage is $8.00. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles: 30 minutes.

The final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. A third of $15000 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \( \boxed{180} \)."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **Travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel by car from Rochester to New Jersey:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Total travel time:**
   - Add the travel time by bus and by car.
   - Total travel time = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add up all these costs:

\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:

\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

30% of 120 watermelons are ready for harvest:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were taken home, leaving:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

After harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the subtotal.

\[ \text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the subtotal to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump in the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. **Penguins jumping in the ocean:**
   - One-third of the 36 penguins jump in the ocean.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins.

2. **Penguins going into the cave:**
   - Another one-third of the 36 penguins go into the cave.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins.

3. **Penguins still sunbathing:**
   - We subtract the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and those that went into the cave from the total number of penguins.
   - Calculation: \( 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \) penguins.

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat together per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week is:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

We know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, the number of pizzas required is:

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has enough empty pens.

Let's calculate the total number of pens step by step:

- **First Cycle**: 
  - He uses 25 pens, which results in 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens by mixing the ink from 25 empty pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens left (25 - 5 = 20).

- **Second Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which results in 5 more empty pens.
  - He now has 25 empty pens (20 from the first cycle + 5 from the second cycle).
  - He can make 5 new pens by mixing the ink from 25 empty pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 0 empty pens left (25 - 5 = 0).

- **Third Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which results in 5 more empty pens.
  - He now has 5 empty pens.
  - He can make 1 new pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens (since 5 / 5 = 1).
  - Now he has 1 new pen and 0 empty pens left (5 - 5 = 0).

- **Fourth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 1 new pen, which results in 1 more empty pen.
  - He now has 1 empty pen.
  - He cannot make any new pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen.

Summarizing the total number of pens:
- Initial pens: 25
- Pens made in the first cycle: 5
- Pens made in the second cycle: 5
- Pens made in the third cycle: 1

Total pens = 25 (initial) + 5 (first cycle) + 5 (second cycle) + 1 (third cycle) = 36

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is **36**."
"Johnny initially took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount of money he had was:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

He then invested this $30, and it tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount of money he had after a year was:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, the final amount of money Johnny had after a year is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining each of their ages based on the information provided.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68

"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. The number of students remaining after this is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. The number of students remaining after this is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[ R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both, without double-counting any book.

1. Dolly reads her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book = 3 books.
2. Pandora reads her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books = 3 books.

Adding these together, the total number of books read by both is 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from his pen pals each week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in response. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes each week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages (responses)} + 30 \text{ pages (replies)} = 60 \text{ pages} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing each week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

\[ 60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes included in the plan:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\)
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\)
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after Ginger gave: \(9 + x\)
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\)
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:**
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\)

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final answer:**
20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the following equation based on the information provided:

The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and in the second aquarium, it is 32. The difference between these numbers is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (F + F) \]
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since the makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done, we need to calculate the discount amount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

So, Jean paid:

\[ \$27,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies:

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid $32. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Total calories:**
- Sue's sister: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

   - Cougars: 15

2. **Determine the number of animals killed today:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cougars killed today.
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three fewer cougars today than he did last night. Therefore, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Wolves: 36
   - Cougars: 12
   - Total animals killed today: \( 36 + 12 = 48 \)

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and now each stall gets 2 more cows, so each stall will have:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows} \]

Since we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{176} \]"

"First, calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, determine the weight of the entire redwood before the termites ate any part of it:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight to find the remaining weight of the redwood:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Therefore, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.
   - The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total additional costs Mrs. Cruz will incur on top of the selling price of the house.

1. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $350,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of $350,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Next, we add these additional costs to the selling price to find the total price of the house.

\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, we determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Selling Price**: $400,000

2. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000

"First, let's break down the time taken for each step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** This takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Susan earns \(\boxed{75}\) dollars for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's break down the activities Darren did on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:

220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

**Total count of activities he's done in the two days:**
370"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members eating rice at each meal, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's sum up the crates sold:

- Weekend sales: 20 crates
- Tuesday sales: 15 crates
- Wednesday sales: 12 crates
- Thursday sales: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

55 crates"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Bid**: Carmen bids after the third other bidder and wins the auction. Her bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- Opening bid: $200
- First bid: $250
- Second bid: $300
- Third bid: $350
- Winning bid: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1500 \]

Thus, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is \(\boxed{1500}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, which is 60 miles each day.
   - He works 5 days a week and the service operates for 50 weeks a year.
   - Therefore, the total miles driven in a year is \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

2. **Calculate the total mileage cost:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile.
   - Therefore, the total mileage cost is \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30000\).

3. **Calculate the total bonus cost:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total bonus cost is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1800\).

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total annual cost is the sum of the mileage cost and the bonus cost.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is \(\$30000 + \$1800 = \$31800\).

**Final Answer:**
\(\$31800\)"
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can accommodate two pages: one on the left front and one on the left back, and similarly, one on the right front and one on the right back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires pages to be printed in pairs on a single piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can hold 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back).
2. To find out how many pieces of paper are needed for 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid."
"Annika initially brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which amounts to:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

She then spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the amount left after spending on rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (the third year).
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - The number of unsold books is 50.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).
   - The number of books sold in the second year is the total sold minus the books sold in the first and third years: \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 65.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:

- Watson works 5 days a week.

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Now, let's add the weekly bonus:

- Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.

So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Finally, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April typically has 4 weeks.

So, his total earnings for April are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning sales.

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can use the following calculation:

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from both items to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

**Final numerical answer:**
$6"
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Adding the extra arms and legs together:
- Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since each business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The remaining amount for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over the course of a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know Quinn's age is 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age is:
   \[
   30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age is:
   \[
   27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. We know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we need to find the population of Chile six years ago. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Then, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is the sum of those who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

\[
8 + 2 = 10
\]

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. This is the sum of the marbles he originally had, the marbles he bought, and the marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]
5. Each marble weighs 2kgs. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
   \[
   78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
   \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kgs."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of People:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **People Who Left:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 10 people left.

3. **People Who Stayed:**
   - Total people who stayed = 40 - 10 = 30

4. **Men Who Stayed:**
   - It is given that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Women Who Stayed:**
   - Since 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed can be calculated as:
   - Women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Men who stayed
   - Women who stayed = 30 - 22 = 8

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Given that the number of loose pencils is 2, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since Jam has three boxes and the total number of pencils in these boxes is 24, we can determine the number of pencils per box by dividing the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Number of pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, let's consider the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes are used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling per ice cube:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Effect of Ice Cubes on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times \text{Number of new records} \]
\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\):
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon took:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[
\text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the $43 purchase to find out how much the customer paid:

\[
\text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles in Scotland. Given that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we can find this number by calculating 40% of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We are told that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore, we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Thus, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

**Furniture United's Offer:**

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

**Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 months * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

**Cost Difference:**
- Difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's calculate the total number of paintball guns they have combined:

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard (RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard (the other one) has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 individuals. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of suckers.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, he needs \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, he needs 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. Therefore, the new price per share after the first year is:

New price per share = $8 * (1 + 50%) = $8 * 1.5 = $12

The value of all 8 shares after the first year is:

Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the second year is:

New price per share = $12 * (1 - 25%) = $12 * 0.75 = $9

The value of all 8 shares after the second year is:

Final value of shares = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in the three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks away, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls to his initial 3 balls.

So, the total number of balls Josh can juggle by the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds (given)
2. **Blue Beetle**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. **Red Bird**: 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
- **Blue Beetle**: 50 pounds
- **Green Toad**: 50 pounds
- **Yellow Snake**: 60 pounds
- **Red Bird**: 30 pounds
- **Container**: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \]

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits that her friend gave her. So, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, let's add up all the baby outfits Laurel has:

- From her friend: 24 outfits
- From her baby shower: 48 outfits
- From her mom: 15 outfits

Total number of baby outfits = \(24 + 48 + 15\)

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats \(\boxed{9}\) cookies."

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos. The formula to calculate the percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she earns from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."

3. Find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Step 1: The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Since the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Step 2: The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought.

- The cost of 6 toy cars: \(6 \times \$2 = \$12\)
- The cost of 5 teddy bears: \(5 \times \$1 = \$5\)

Adding these together gives the total cost of the items:
\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the items, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends (including arcade tokens):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and her friends} = \text{Total cost for one person} + \text{Arcade tokens}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and her friends} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

5. **Total budget:**
   \[
   \text{Total budget} = \$90
   \]

6. **Money left for friends:**
   \[
   \text{Money left for friends} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total cost for Morgan}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left for friends} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

7. **Cost per friend (excluding Morgan):**
   \[
   \text{Cost per friend} = \$25
   \]

8. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Money left for friends}}{\text{Cost per friend}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan can only invite whole friends, she can invite 2 friends.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets in total over 5 days from her parents:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops she buys each day:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops over 5 days:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the lollipops from the total amount of money Marisa gets over 5 days to find out how much she saves:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy had left after buying the gumballs is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying the gumballs is:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 16/2 = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:

\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{4}{3}} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both segments to get the total time:
- Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Therefore, the total time John spent on his trip is 6 hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to ensure that the total points from all three tests sum to at least 42 points.

First, we add the points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 \text{ points} + 18 \text{ points} = 33 \text{ points} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach at least 42 points:
\[ 42 \text{ points} - 33 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the number of people kicked out for each of the three specific reasons:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

To find the total number of people kicked out for these three reasons, we add these numbers together:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The problem states that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total number of people kicked out:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames and the etching for all 44 seniors.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   \[
   44 \text{ seniors} \times \$20 \text{ per frame} = \$880
   \]

2. **Cost of etching:**
   The etching cost is 20% of the cost of each picture frame.
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4 \text{ per frame}
   \]
   \[
   44 \text{ seniors} \times \$4 \text{ per frame} = \$176
   \]

3. **Total cost for picture frames and etching:**
   \[
   \$880 + \$176 = \$1056
   \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pins and cords.

4. **Cost of pins:**
   2 seniors will receive pins.
   \[
   2 \text{ seniors} \times \$5 \text{ per pin} = \$10
   \]

5. **Cost of cords:**
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 44 = 11 \text{ officers}
   \]
   \[
   11 \text{ officers} \times \$12 \text{ per cord} = \$132
   \]

6. **Total cost for pins and cords:**

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is \(\boxed{1198}\)."
"To determine the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY approach and subtract that from the original market price.

1. Calculate the savings from the DIY approach:
   - The savings is 20% of the original market price.
   - Original market price = $400.
   - Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.

2. Subtract the savings from the original market price to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Original market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"Let's break down the sales day by day:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

The total number of pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is \(50 \times 2 = 100\) shoes.

**Final Answer:**

1. On Tuesdays, Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as on Tuesdays, which means it was \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we sum these hours:
\[ 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice each week.

"First, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment is faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

"Mary has 30 sheep, half of which produce 1 kg of milk and the other half produce 2 kg of milk every day.

First, calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk produced by both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman initially made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, 12 - 6 = 6 rolls remained.

48 pieces"
"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves us with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 20 pupils like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, 5 pupils like green. The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[ 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year), the interest rate is:
\[ 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{5}{6}\% \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{5}{6}\% = 3650 \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{100} = 3650 \times \frac{5}{600} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = \frac{3650}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we need to determine how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Given that she sells 4 cups per hour, the time to sell 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
   \]
4. To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 6 erasers:
   - Each eraser costs $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 8 pencils:
   - Each pencil costs $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

3. Add the costs together to find the total cost:

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's cost with tickets: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together, the total number of gifts is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount:

- The discount amount is 20% of $30:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

- The final cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month:

- The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the bundled streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of spaces. So, we calculate double the number of spaces and then add 20:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry \(\boxed{92}\) books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she passed out is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards Erica has:

- She started with 50 cards.
- She passed out 29 cards.
- She received 17 cards.

The net change is \(50 - 29 + 17\).

Calculating this, we get:
\[50 - 29 = 21\]
\[21 + 17 = 38\]

So, Erica now has \(\boxed{38}\) Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since she saw 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs:

\[ 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

"First, let's calculate the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we determine how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- Each bag contains 2 cups.
- Number of bags needed: \(\frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags}\)

For milk:
- Each bottle contains 2 cups.
- Number of bottles needed: \(\frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   36 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. Another zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the stripes:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 4 zebras in total. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

1. **Number of employees in May**: 40
2. **Hourly wage**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

The weekly pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

For 40 employees, the total pay in May is:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

1. **Number of employees at the start of June**: 40
2. **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired**: 
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 30 employees, the total pay in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 30 \text{ employees} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%
- We need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that might explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can assume that the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be the product of the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog and the percentage of candles that might explode.

However, since the problem does not specify the overlap, and assuming the defects are independent, we can calculate the expected number of candles that both have the wet dog smell and might explode as follows:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode} = \left(\frac{5}{100} \times 50,000\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{100} \times 50,000\right) \]

But since we are looking for the number of candles that both have the wet dog smell and might explode, we can simplify this to:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode} = \frac{5}{100} \times \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 \times 50,000 = \frac{5 \times 1}{100 \times 100} \times 50,000 = \frac{5}{10,000} \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode is:

"First, calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse.

\[ \text{Sale price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so multiply the sale price by 4 to find the total cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Next, we know that Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 + 0 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."

2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Peter's locker size**: We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. **Zack's locker size**: Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. **Timothy's locker size**: Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 20 cats that were carried away from the initial 50 cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\$256
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is given as $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the sale price, so:
\[ J = 22 + 6 = 28 \]

However, the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since both the original prices are the same ($28), the difference is:
\[ 28 - 28 = 0 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost the same as the tattered jeans, and the difference is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. We know that each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders. Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. The total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she built is \(3 \times 30 = 90\). The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(90 + 60 = 150\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

The cost of the soup is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cost of the cake is half the price of the bagel:
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have two hotdogs each.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

2. **Additional Guests:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than the initial 36 guests.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the initial 36 guests.
   - Since 40 guests showed up, and 36 hotdogs were already prepared, there are \(40 - 36 = 4\) additional guests.

3. **Hotdogs Needed for Second Hotdog:**
   - The initial 36 guests were supposed to have one hotdog each, and half of them (18 guests) were to have a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the caterer needed to prepare an additional \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs for the second hotdog for these 18 guests.
   - However, the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs initially, which means he did not have enough for the second hotdog for all 18 guests.

4. **Hotdogs Available for Second Hotdog:**
   - The caterer had 36 hotdogs initially.
   - After serving the first hotdog to all 36 guests, 36 hotdogs were used.
   - Therefore, there are no hotdogs left for the second hotdog for the initial 36 guests.
   - Since 4 additional guests showed up, and the caterer did not have any hotdogs left for the second hotdog, these 4 additional guests also did not get a second hotdog.

5. **Total Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - The 18 guests who were supposed to have a second hotdog did not get it.
   - The 4 additional guests who showed up did not get a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the total number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(18 + 4 = 22\).

**Final Answer:**
22 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 more letters to this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. This means he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his four friends equally.

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces have been eaten. Since the cake was divided equally, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts his drive. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads (Margareth)} - 60 \text{ beads (Elizabeth)} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   The total cooling effect is:
   \[
   3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

So, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs that were loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. Therefore, the revenue from the flash sale is:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

The salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's break down the costs and savings step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of popcorn and soda minus the cost of the super ticket equals $2.
   - Mathematically, this is: \((15 + P) - 21 = 2\)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   15 + P - 21 = 2
   \]
   \[
   P - 6 = 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 8

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 65 \times 170
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
65 \times 170 = 65 \times (100 + 70) = (65 \times 100) + (65 \times 70) = 6500 + 4550 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the distance for the first part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Calculate the distance for the second part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total Distance = Distance of first part + Distance of second part = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total Time = Time of first part + Time of second part = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join the group. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 more fairies joined the 50 that were already there. This brings the total to:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Subtracting these 30 fairies from the total of 75 gives:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from aluminum cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from plastic bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he now has \(200 + 10 = 210\) shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes. Now he has \(210 + 30 = 240\) shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes. Now he has \(240 + 60 = 300\) shoes.

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to determine the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we calculate the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book:
\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books each of her 4 kids received. We divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Since there are 32 kids in total in the class, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. According to the problem, the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we need to find the combined weight of both pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}
\]
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

Thus, the combined weight of the two pennies is:
\[
\boxed{84}

"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. According to the problem, the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, we calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

Next, we determine how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has \(\boxed{6}\) girl Pomeranians."

The average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \]"
"First, calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"First, let's determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she gets the second pack free. Thus, she only pays for 1 pack:

- Cost for 1 pack = \$4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the reduced price:

- Reduced price after coupon = \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00.

Heather is buying 2 packs, which is 8 razors, for \$2.00. To find the cost per razor:

- Cost per razor = \(\frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}\).

Converting this to cents:

- \$0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is 25 cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid would be the height of the shortest cheerleader since they are at the top and their height will be the limiting factor.

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Angela is 38 years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for the morning rides.
2. Calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the morning rides.**
- Paul drives in the morning 14 days.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides = 14 days * $6/day = $84.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides.**
- Paul drives in the afternoon 14 days.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides = 14 days * $2/day = $28.

**Step 3: Add the two amounts together.**
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by three to find out how many pies they can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food. Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. So, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43\]

The number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total amount of yarn they used altogether is:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 popsicle sticks, and each costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

"First, calculate the total number of legs for Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Given that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40/\text{day} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's consider the cost with the weekly bus pass. The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

To find out how much Janet would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the combined total number of animals in the farm and the zoo is:

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, we calculate the number of onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \times 4 = 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \times 4 = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

After buying clothes, the remaining amount of money is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

After buying CDs, the remaining amount of money is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie had left is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for all the bags is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

"First, let's determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. The amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this, we get \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"First, let's calculate the number of skeins of wool needed for one set of winter wear for one grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Adding these together for one grandchild:
\[ 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 \text{ skeins} \]

Since Martha is making these items for 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:
\[ 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ skeins} \]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each individual:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Next, we sum the rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Therefore, her new daily consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is still $1.50, so her new weekly cost is:
     \[
     98 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147/\text{week}
     \]

Finally, let's find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \$147/\text{week} - \$126/\text{week} = \$21/\text{week}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

The rate of one person painting a house is therefore \( \frac{1}{10} \) of a house per day.

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of a house per day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can calculate the number of CDs he could buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one CD:

Number of CDs = Total money available / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs = $48 / $4
Number of CDs = 12

Since Tom already bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

12 - 1 = 11

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
   \[
   1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[
40

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]
So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Since Jame is currently 22 and his cousin is currently 47, the age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as \( G \).

Given that the boys brought 60 seashells each, the girls brought:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

Calculating the expression:
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

Final numerical answer:
300"
"First, determine how many candies George originally had. Since George now has 3 candies left after eating 5, we can calculate the original number of candies George had as follows:

\[ \text{Original candies George had} = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Nick had twice as many candies as George originally. Therefore, the number of candies Nick had is:

\[ \text{Candies Nick had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Nick has \(\boxed{16}\) candies."
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks.

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma has made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18"
"First, let's calculate the total bill including the tip.

1. The base bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of $50, which is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \).

So, the total bill including the tip is \( 50 + 10 = 60 \).

Since the check is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.

Each person pays \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

Therefore, you ended up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left. Therefore, the amount he has now is:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{39}

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to understand the structure of the month and the saving pattern.

April has 30 days, which can be divided into two halves:
- First half: 15 days
- Second half: 15 days

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

In the second half of the month, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, his daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of the month would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the entire month is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

- The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."

For Jenny:
- Pay per task: $0.5
- Number of tasks: 20
- Total earnings: \( 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \) dollars

Next, find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference: \( 16 - 10 = 6 \) dollars

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles.

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of toys in James's play set:**
   James's play set has 80 toys.

2. **Calculate the number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set:**
   Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger than James's play set.
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs:**
   Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys.
   Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered:

1. The cost of the hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20\)
2. The cost of the packs of potato fries: \(10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$3\)
3. The cost of the cans of fruit drinks: \(5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:
\[
\$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find the change she receives:
\[
\$50 - \$33 = \$17
\]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of water bottles required for the 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles available} = 92 \text{ additional bottles needed} \]

Therefore, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ \text{Time in warm water for 1 mile} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We start by calculating the total time for 3 miles in each condition.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes \(\boxed{54}\) minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

   - Total holes from these buttons = \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

2. **Buttons with four holes:**
   - The total number of buttons is 21.
   - The number of buttons with four holes = \(21 - 7 = 14\).
   - Total holes from these buttons = \(14 \times 4 = 56\).

3. **Total holes in all buttons:**
   - Total holes = Holes from buttons with two holes + Holes from buttons with four holes.
   - Total holes = \(14 + 56 = 70\).

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is \(\boxed{180}\) pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time of Movement**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of the Sun**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Movement} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground is the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   \text{Final Angle} = \text{Initial Angle} + \text{Total Movement} = 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

"First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. 

Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).

Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each of the three teenagers: Richie, Mark, and Anna.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:

"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. Since he started with $70 and spent $40 from Sunday to Wednesday, the remaining amount is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he can buy with $40 is:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
     - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we'll calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we'll calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we'll add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5. So, \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
4. Next, this value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is. There are 90 pairs in 180 contacts.

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Next, calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned.

- Water needed = 100 ml/calorie * 1600 calories = 160,000 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 160,000 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speeds, we first need to determine the three speeds:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Weight change from eating Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\).

2. **Weight change from eating donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\).

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - The difference in weight change between eating donuts and Cheerios is \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\).

Therefore, at the end of 5 weeks, Martin will be 15 pounds heavier if he eats donuts for breakfast compared to eating Cheerios."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Total = \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{316}\) seats."
"Let's break down the weights step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(2 \times 10 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(44 \times 5 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:
- Cost of boots: $16

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of 2 implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Total cost for 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The porcelain crown for one implant costs an extra $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown: \( 500 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of dental work:**

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
- \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees
- \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's convert all the coins Colby has into nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add up all the nickels (in cents) Colby has:
\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of one gumball:
\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

Therefore, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine how many years the tire can last:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - Therefore, the number of years the tire can last is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"First, let's determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert the cost per washing to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ cents per washing}}{60 \text{ washings per pump}} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ cents per pump} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents per pump} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"

   - Discount amount: \( 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \)

2. **Discount on the shorts:**
   - Original price of the shorts: $35
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \)

3. **Total cost after discounts:**
   - Total cost: \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \)

4. **Money left after the purchase:**
   - Joe's initial amount: $50
   - Total cost after discounts: $42.00
   - Money left: \( 50 - 42 = 8.00 \)

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Cost per meter = $194
- Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
- Total cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
- Total cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
- Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Research Duration:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.

3. **Funding for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining 45 months, the cost per month increases by 50% each month.

Let's calculate the cost for each of the remaining 45 months:

- **Month 6:** \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\)
- **Month 7:** \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\)
- **Month 8:** \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\)
- **Month 9:** \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\)
- **Month 10:** \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\)

We can see that the cost for each month forms a geometric sequence with the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \(a = 150,000\), \(r = 1.5\), and \(n = 45\).

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]

First, calculate \(1.5^{45}\):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467 \]

Now, substitute back into the formula:
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1,162,261.467 - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1,162,260.467}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \times 2,324,520.934 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 348,678,140.1 \]

Finally, add the initial $100,000 to the total cost of the remaining 45 months:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 348,678,140.1 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} \approx 348,778,140.1 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately $348,778,140.10."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \]"
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, multiply the daily total by the number of days in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is:

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of loads per week:**
   Gary does laundry twice a week.

2. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the number of loads per year is:
   \[
   2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total gallons of water used per year:**
   Each load uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total gallons of water used per year is:
   \[
   104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the water used per year:**
   The cost of one gallon of water is $0.15. Therefore, the total cost of the water used per year is:
   \[
   2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year}
   \]

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it grew to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the parents. To find out how many seats were occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert Ashley's speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck during the week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Adam needs to grow to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost to the company for acquiring these cars. The company paid 30% of the price for each car:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

The total cost for the company to acquire 10 cars is:

\[ 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. Therefore, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, the final amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, the price of a silver jewel is:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes to close the gap:**
   - Initial distance between Bob and Tom: 75 miles
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's determine the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes, so the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can miss some classes without his parents refusing to sign him up again. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Rearrange the terms to isolate \( x \):

\[ 10x \leq 40 \]

\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers weekly.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers weekly.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for the two:

\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

**Total weekly production for Julie and Jewel: 1050 customers.**"

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \(\frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30\) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \(\frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10\) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, the cost for 5 apples is \(5 \times 1.30 = 6.50\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, the cost for 5 oranges is \(5 \times 1.10 = 5.50\) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \(6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00\) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"

   - Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for dress pants = \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
   - Total cost = \( 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \) dollars.

"1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so he is \(64 / 2 = 32\) years old.
4. Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"First, determine the total amount of flour in one bag before it was divided into portions. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms/portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of flour in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, the total amount of flour in three bags is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms/bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked separately and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. Since he has to dig through 24 feet of soil, the time taken to dig through the soil is:

\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. He digs through clay at half the speed he digs through soil, which is:

\[ \text{Speed through clay} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]

Since he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, the time taken to dig through the clay is:

\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:

"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the type of cupcakes each person will get.

1. Howie will buy 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate) for each person.
2. The people who will receive cupcakes include Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. This totals to 27 people (1 + 1 + 25).

Since each person will get 2 cupcakes, we multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes per person:

\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.
2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after 3 weeks is:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. **Additional Likes Recently**: She received 20000 more new likes recently. So, the total number of likes now is:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila received a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month were:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he effectively pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first paid hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is $15 + $60 = $75.

Therefore, James paid $75."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount received to find out how much was withheld.

First, we find out how much money Sally received this week. Her bank account started with $200 and now has $420. The difference between these amounts is the total money received this week:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. Since she received $220, the difference between her expected wage and the amount she received is the amount that was withheld:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount of money withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental:**
   - The hanger rental costs $5,000 per month.

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\) dollars per month.

Next, we calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental} + \text{Fuel Cost} = 5,000 + 10,000 = 15,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = 15,000 \times 12 = 180,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Cost} + \text{Total Annual Cost} = 150,000 + 180,000 = 330,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{330000} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans.
   - Total cooking time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to cover the additional 8 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to cover the additional 12 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Therefore, Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is:

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Determine how many more signatures they need to reach 100.

First, let's find the total number of signatures they currently have:
- Carol has 20 signatures.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures.
- Together, they have \(20 + 44 = 64\) signatures.

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach 100:
- Their goal is 100 signatures.
- They currently have 64 signatures.
- Therefore, they need \(100 - 64 = 36\) more signatures.

So, the sisters need to collect \(\boxed{36}\) more signatures to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's determine how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, we can calculate how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack:

- Weight of one adult = 80 kg
- Number of adults = 8
- Weight of 8 adults = 80 kg/adult * 8 adults = 640 kg

- Weight of Jack = 80 kg

- Total weight of Jack and 8 adults = 640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

Next, subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight to find the excess:

- Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg
- Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is:
20 kg"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's sum up the cookies each person has:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

Final answer:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, they have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples**: Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Bananas**: Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo.
   \[
   \text{Cost of bananas} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Oranges**: Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.
   \[
   \text{Cost of oranges} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the apples, bananas, and oranges to find the total amount Catherine pays.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of 14 dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

After baking, the pair eats 10 of the cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that the twins are the same age, we have \( T_1 = T_2 \). Also, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]
or
\[ T_1 = P_2 + 7 \]
or
\[ T_1 = P_3 + 7 \]

The combined ages of all four individuals are 44, so we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
Since \( T_1 = T_2 \), this simplifies to:
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Without loss of generality, let's assume \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \). Then we can substitute \( P_1 = T_1 - 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2T_1 + (T_1 - 7) + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3T_1 - 7 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3T_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 51 \]

Since \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) are the ages of the other two triplets, and they are the same age as \( P_1 \) (because they are triplets), we have \( P_2 = P_1 \) and \( P_3 = P_1 \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ 3T_1 + 2P_1 = 51 \]
Substituting \( P_1 = T_1 - 7 \) again, we get:
\[ 3T_1 + 2(T_1 - 7) = 51 \]
\[ 3T_1 + 2T_1 - 14 = 51 \]
\[ 5T_1 - 14 = 51 \]
\[ 5T_1 = 65 \]
\[ T_1 = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong and Neil over these 120 months.

For Rong:
\[ \text{Total savings for Rong} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

For Neil:
\[ \text{Total savings for Neil} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Adding the total savings of Rong and Neil together gives us the final answer:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we calculate the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we have:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \text{ bucks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \text{ eight-point bucks} \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren), so the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies), so the total number of great-grandbabies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = \(3 \times 5 = 15\) fireworks.

Now, let's determine how many of the city's fireworks Hannah will see. Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks:

- 40% of 300 fireworks = \(0.40 \times 300 = 120\) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off in her backyard to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah will see = \(120 + 15 = 135\).

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together gives:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the following equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 4,800 \text{ pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Let \( x \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Then we have:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
     \[
     50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
     \[
     12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

4. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream:**
   - Adding the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add up the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops Erin buys, she gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50, so the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

With this deal, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream for $3.00. Now, let's see how many such deals Erin can afford with her $6.00:

\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00 \text{ per deal}} = 2 \text{ deals} \]

Since each deal gives her 3 scoops, 2 deals will give her:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 deals, which means she should buy 2 scoops to get 6 scoops in total.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

14"
"First, calculate the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet.

\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds.

The cost at the store would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Calories per egg = 75
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Calories per ounce of cheese = 120
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Calories per ounce of ham = 40
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Now, we add up the calories from all the ingredients:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

The omelet has a total of 770 calories."
"First, calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Cost of one pencil = $0.50
- Number of pencils = 6
- Total cost of pencils = $0.50 × 6 = $3.00

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
- Cost of one eraser = $0.25
- Number of erasers = 8
- Total cost of erasers = $0.25 × 8 = $2.00

Now, add the total cost of pencils and erasers to find the overall cost:
- Total cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers
- Total cost = $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
- Amount paid = $10.00
- Change = Amount paid - Total cost
- Change = $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the change you would get is $5.00."

\[8 - 4 = 4\]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \, \text{taps}\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \, \text{taps}\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the cost of the city council's fine and the cost of materials to the potential damage to his car.

1. **Potential Damage to Car**: $450
2. **City Council Fine for Unauthorized Road Maintenance**: $120
3. **Cost of 3 Buckets of Asphalt**: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Now, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{City Council Fine} + \text{Cost of Asphalt} = 120 + 75 = 195 \]

Next, we compare this total cost to the potential damage to his car:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Potential Damage} - \text{Total Cost} = 450 - 195 = 255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole himself."

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends) who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people in line:** 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00):** 
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]
   So, the number of people remaining after midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. **People who voted by 16:00 (4:00 PM):**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]
   So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- In total, they will need \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- The number of sleeves needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's sum up the weights:

- Math books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 math books)
- Science books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 science books)
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds

"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

Therefore, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play music**: Twice the number that like to play basketball, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - (\text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music})
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25

"First, let's determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same amount of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

This means there are 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"

   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8

"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide the total number of students by the new number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students.

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students if each group must have a whole number of students. Given that 6 groups are already formed, we need to find out how many more groups are required to make 12 groups in total:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form the required 12 groups.

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays in 4 weeks:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs rented on weekdays in 4 weeks is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekends in 4 weeks:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs rented on weekends in 4 weeks is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total chairs rented in 4 weeks:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in 4 weeks is the sum of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts to find out how many are left:

- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to get the total number of items Jeff has now:

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes:

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) large buttons.

3. **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Large buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60

Total buttons = 27 (small) + 60 (large) + 60 (small) = 147 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of Pomeranians:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( P \) represent the total number of puppies. We can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times P = 18
\]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[
P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."

Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of pears and bananas together:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits."

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels needed = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels left is \(\boxed{276}\)."

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on. According to the problem, \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects. According to the problem, \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"First, let's determine the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost 30 dollars. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money was spent on the other two pizzas. The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the cost for the other two pizzas is:

\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in those 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
Thus, the number of rides in those 2 days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days gives the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \) on one side, we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Finally, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule:

- Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
- Half an hour each day for 14 days is \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the second part of her schedule:

- Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule:

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

So, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

**Final Answer:**
20 miles"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

- Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

- Final amount = Total cost of materials + Premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade.

For the third graders:
- Number of students who passed: 340
- Total number of students: 500
- Pass rate = \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%

For the fourth graders:
- Number of students who passed: 40
- Total number of students: 100
- Pass rate = \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%

For the fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
- Fourth graders' pass rate = 0.40
- Fifth graders' pass rate = \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%
- Number of students who passed: \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \)

Now, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school.

- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)
- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)
- Overall pass rate = \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is then:
\[ 3 \times L = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation:
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[48 \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after the second order: \(100 + 100 = 200\)
2. Candies sold: 150

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

\[200 - 150 = 50\]

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **End of January**: The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
3. **End of February**: The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
4. **End of March**: The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
5. **End of April**: The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
6. **End of May**: The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find the additional number of students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the end of May: 320
- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10

The additional number of students that joined by the end of May is:

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these totals to find the initial number of petals:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose then drops 1 of each type of flower she picked. This means she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

1. Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters.
2. Each of the two friends who can play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters each.
3. The friend who can play for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters.

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68\]

So, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:

\[68 \times 0.25 = 17\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We can substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation for \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. \]

The total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10. \]
Substituting \( o = 4z \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 10z = 10. \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 1. \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4. \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost for goats: $1500
- Total cost for cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars he no longer has is the sum of the cars he sold and the cars he gave away:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound for the weight of the book and $0.08 per mile for the distance to the distribution center.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]

Adding these two costs together gives the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Money lost} = 3.00 - 24 = -21 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Milly will actually receive $21 more than she loses in shipping costs. However, the question asks for the amount of money Milly will lose, which in this context is the absolute value of the negative result.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gave her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has before her purchases is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. The total cost of her purchases is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the total amount of money she had:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find out how much is left for the fourth week.

1. **First Week Production:**

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate for the month. Since he produces 50,000 bars each month, the production for the fourth week is:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs additional items: 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. We need to calculate the cost for the additional items:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:

$129.00 (base installation) + $30.00 (additional mirrors) + $15.00 (additional chandelier) + $150.00 (additional pictures) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum them up.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Total Distance = Distance of First Segment + Distance of Second Segment
   - Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same distance. Since the speed is the same for all kangaroos, the time taken by one kangaroo would also be 18 hours.

Next, we need to find the speed of the turtles. The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours to travel the distance, a turtle, traveling at half the speed, would take twice as long to cover the same distance.

So, the time taken by one turtle to travel the distance is:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since the question asks how long it will take four turtles to travel the same distance, and since they are all traveling at the same speed, the time taken by four turtles will be the same as the time taken by one turtle. Therefore, the time taken by four turtles is:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's determine how many clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Therefore, Rory makes:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40 \text{ clay dishes}
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada makes:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ clay dishes}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora to find the total number of clay dishes they all make together:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop after all her contributions.

This means the total amount Erika has, including the $50 she still needs, is $400. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Amount in purse} + \$150 + \$80 + \$50 = \$400 \]

Now, let's solve for the amount in her purse:
\[ \text{Amount in purse} + \$280 + \$50 = \$400 \]
\[ \text{Amount in purse} + \$330 = \$400 \]
\[ \text{Amount in purse} = \$400 - \$330 \]
\[ \text{Amount in purse} = \$70 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10\) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) millimeters

Now, we sum the lengths of the unused glue from all three glue sticks:
\[10 + 4 + 6 = 20\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{20}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:
- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800
Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:
- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200
Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Amount needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars. The hat cost $70. Therefore, the change Thea received is \(80 - 70 = 10\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \) (Jack has 30 socks).
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

**Final Answer: 180**"
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 + 8 = 13 students are either good at math only or English only, the remaining students are good at both subjects:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Next, we add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English to find the total number of students good at math:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. This is given as:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes (getting on stage)} + 6 \text{ minutes (performing)} + 2 \text{ minutes (exiting)} = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes. So, the total time for one group plus the intermission is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute segments fit into the 120-minute concert time. This is calculated by dividing the total concert time by the time required for one group plus the intermission:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   However, this interpretation seems incorrect because an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical. Instead, we should interpret it as a fraction of the principal amount, which is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 1 = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for one year:**
   \[
   I = P \times r = 300 \times 0.75 = 225
   \]

4. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = I \times \text{number of years} = 225 \times 3 = 675
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{975}

"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- This means the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the number of goats sold from each farm:

- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

Next, we'll determine the number of goats left in each farm after the sales:

- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

Finally, we'll add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:

- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, calculate the total cost for the baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for the baskets of red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- Therefore, the total cost for red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the total costs for the green and red food to find the overall total:
- Total cost for green food: $75.
- Total cost for red food: $48.
- Therefore, the total amount to be paid is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person in question (you).

From the problem, we can establish the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother:
\[ A = B - 3 \]

2. You are two years older than your sister:
\[ S = A - 2 \]

3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

4. The sum of all their ages is 87:
\[ A + B + S + M = 87 \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum equation:

\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 16 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation for \( A \):

\[ A = B - 3 \]
\[ A = 16 - 3 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old.

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:

Next, we add the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars + Number of yellow cars

75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + Number of yellow cars

Now, let's calculate the number of yellow cars:

Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. To find out how much Madeline pays, we calculate:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining 40%:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month):
\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first day:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so the remaining pieces after the second day are:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces he ate over the three days:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle for soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost for David's purchase.

5. **Total cost:**
   - $9.00 (soda) + $4.00 (water) = $13.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide the total earnings by the number of hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving more from his friend:

Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from each type of question.

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - Total questions: 10
   - Correctly answered: 80% of 10 = \(0.80 \times 10 = 8\)
   - Points per question: 1
   - Total points from multiple-choice: \(8 \times 1 = 8\)

2. **True/false questions:**
   - Total questions: 20
   - Correctly answered: 90% of 20 = \(0.90 \times 20 = 18\)

Now, we sum up the points from all types of questions:
\[ 8 \text{ (multiple-choice)} + 18 \text{ (true/false)} + 15 \text{ (long-answer)} = 41 \]

Therefore, Amy scores a total of 41 points."
"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens he bought plus the $2000 profit. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he bought is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of chickens}} = \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for is:

\[ \boxed{38.89} \]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[ \boxed{575} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she plans to sell it for $2 per meter. Therefore, the total amount of money she will earn is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters. Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the money she earned:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

3. To find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old, we subtract her current age from 24:
   \[
   24 - 8 = 16
   \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

**Final Answer:**
16"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away toys to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky, we can calculate the remaining number of toys as follows:

- Toys given to Alyssa: 40
- Toys given to Bonnie: 80
- Toys given to Nicky: 30

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[ 6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Lani initially baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, leaving her with \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

So, the number of cookies in each jar is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

15"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}
\]"
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( x \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11x \) meters per second. According to the problem, \( 11x = 121 \) meters per second. Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Now, we know the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[
5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the salad**: $6
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. **Total cost of the salad and yogurt**: $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.

Given that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods, we can find the total cost of the carrots by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost:
4. **Total cost of carrots**: $11 (total) - $9 (salad and yogurt) = $2.

Since Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, the cost of one carrot is:
5. **Cost of one carrot**: $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Information Given:**
   - The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, \( K = 3J \).
   - The following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, \( A = 5J \).

3. **Calculate the Total Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. So, Tasha earned \( 6J \) from Joe.
   - Kamala paid Tasha the same rate, so she earned \( 6K = 6(3J) = 18J \) from Kamala.
   - Alba also paid Tasha the same rate, so she earned \( 6A = 6(5J) = 30J \) from Alba.
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \).

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Tasha's total earnings from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month were $80. So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     54J + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80
     \]
   - Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade. Then:
     \[
     54J + L = 80
     \]

5. **Determine the Value of \( J \):**
   - Since \( J \) must be a whole number and the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6, we need to find a value of \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a feasible part of the total $80.
   - The only feasible value for \( J \) is 1 (since \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) which is more than 80).
   - So, \( J = 1 \).

6. **Calculate the Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( K = 3 \) and \( A = 5 \).
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \).

7. **Calculate the Earnings from Lemonade:**
   - The earnings from lemonade is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \).

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. Therefore, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car each month is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

Therefore, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family during the meal. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the adults. The two children will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the children. In total, they will consume 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls of soup.

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and they will consume 4 bowls, there will be no soup left over after the meal. Therefore, the number of times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is 0.

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20:
     \[
     \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8:
     \[
     \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total material needed:**
   - To find the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies:
- There are 9 movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

\[
\text{Total number of times} = 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times}
\]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[
\text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27 \text{ tickets}} = \$8
\]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes out of the 7 he has. Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:

\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:

\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Finally, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles he gave away from his original number of marbles:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. This is calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing these 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Therefore, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
     \[
     58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, the number of yellow balloons is:
     \[
     \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\[5 + 10 + 8 = 23\]

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the expenses and then determine the total allowance given to Julia and Nadine.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount given to both of them is $28. Since they were given the same amount, we divide the total by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball.

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.

Next, let's add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two activities:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, let's consider the students playing soccer:
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we can now add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:
\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat in one day. Together, they can eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat together in one day. So, we perform the division \(24 \div 6 = 4\).

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, there are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months. Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

Final numerical answer:
\[
60

"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
\]

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \).

Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + x = 9
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[
2x = 9
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5

1. **Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

2. **Determine the total number of berries needed per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \( \boxed{12} \)."
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, then over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. Therefore, the remaining amount he has is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday. He wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and the box of candy, the remaining amount he has is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can buy one more movie ticket.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see this month is:
\[5 + 8 + 1 = 14\] movies.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by the bus.**
The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the car.**
The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in distance traveled.**
To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes worth of stuff.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney combined:
- Total distance = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants:
- Number of participants: 2
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Widgets produced by Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Widgets produced by WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259,200 \]

Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194,400 \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[ \$259,200 - \$194,400 = \$64,800 \]

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional hours after that. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. For the additional hours, Cameron will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The number of additional hours is:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for these additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay using the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs. The total is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then deposits $100 in the bank, so his remaining money is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters each has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

Each school has 7 rows, with 8 children in each row. Therefore, the number of children in one row is 8, and the number of rows per school is 7. So, the number of children per school is calculated as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows/school} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children is:

\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. **Yams:**
   - Quantity: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Quantity: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Quantity: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining 8 miles (since \(20 - 12 = 8\)) at half his original speed. His new speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70.

The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of loaves the bakery has} = 7 \times (\text{Number of loaves Sam had}) - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[ \text{Number of loaves the bakery has} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

First, we calculate \(7 \times 70\):

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{450} \]"

Therefore, at the end, Jasmine has \(\boxed{13}\) stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales:

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:

\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo’s age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus’s age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (since the total points scored by the team is 45)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was in bed and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Total time in bed:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference between 2:15 a.m. and 2:38 a.m. is \(38 - 15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Time Kim was actually sleeping:**
   - Total time in bed: 480 minutes.
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time actually sleeping: \(480 - 23 = 457\) minutes.

4. **Adjusting for the earlier wake-up time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she was in bed for 5 minutes less than the usual 8 hours.
   - The adjusted time in bed: \(480 - 5 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Final time Kim was actually sleeping:**
   - Adjusted time in bed: 475 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

1/5 of 1000 beds are occupied, so:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds occupied} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of beds that will be occupied after 2 weeks (14 days) with 50 new patients being admitted each day:

\[ 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ new patients} \]

Adding the new patients to the current number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ 200 \text{ current occupied beds} + 700 \text{ new patients} = 900 \text{ occupied beds} \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people as \(x\). According to Kelly, Courtney reported \(x + 0.20x = 1.20x\), and this number is 48.

So, we have the equation:
\[1.20x = 48\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40\]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

To verify, we can find \( X \) using the second equation:
\[ X = S + 5 \]
\[ X = 147 + 5 \]
\[ X = 152 \]

Finally, we check the total number of Pokemon caught:
\[ X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \]
The total is correct, so the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( \boxed{147} \)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}
\]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting for her.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made by Greta: 12
- Brownies received from the office party: 6
- Brownies received from the surprise party: 48

Total brownies before the surprise party: \(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\)

Next, we subtract the brownies eaten during the surprise party:

- Brownies eaten: 18

Total brownies left: \(66 - 18 = 48\)

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

\(\boxed{48}\)"
"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\) years. Therefore, the sister's age is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. **Synthetic Gut Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we sum the total times for each type of stringing:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (one for himself, one for his wife, and one for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is:
\[ \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$300 = \$600 \]

Adding the costs together, the total amount John paid for all 4 phones is:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1800 \]"
"First, determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

5"
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we know the total number of cherries shared by Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( G_S = 10 \)
2. \( A_S = A_U - 4 \)
3. \( G_U = G_S + 5 \)
4. \( A_U = 15 \)

Now, let's solve for the unknowns:
- From equation 3, since \( G_S = 10 \):
  \[
  G_U = 10 + 5 = 15
  \]
- From equation 4, we already know:
  \[
  A_U = 15
  \]
- From equation 2, substituting \( A_U = 15 \):
  \[
  A_S = 15 - 4 = 11
  \]

Now we have the number of boxes sold for each day:
- Saturday: \( G_S = 10 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_S = 11 \) boxes of apple pie
- Sunday: \( G_U = 15 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_U = 15 \) boxes of apple pie

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday:
  \[
  10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$60
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday:
  \[
  11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$165
  \]
- Total earnings on Saturday:
  \[
  \$60 + \$165 = \$225
  \]

- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday:
  \[
  15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$90
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday:
  \[
  15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$225
  \]
- Total earnings on Sunday:
  \[
  \$90 + \$225 = \$315
  \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to get the total earnings:
\[
\$225 + \$315 = \$540
\]

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{540}\) dollars for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, she uses \( 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:**
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.
   - Over 8 days, she will use \( 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \).

3. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount per bottle: \( \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \).

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had altogether 90 beads."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} + 6 \text{ (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
7

"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this number as follows:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ cheerleaders or band members} \]

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, calculate the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes together and dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the spacing are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length by the space each plant requires:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 = \$9.00\)
- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one hanging basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\$70.00\) filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations gives us \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, with 3 pounds of soil remaining, they can plant \(3 \div 1 = 3\) roses.

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck:

\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. Next, we determine how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since the peeling and sautering are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - If Bill's dad was \( D \) years old when he saw the comet, and 75 years have passed since then, Bill's age at the second sighting is \( D + 75 \).
   - We also know that Bill's age at the second sighting is \( 3D \).

5. **Solve for \( D \):**
   \[
   D + 75 = 3D
   \]
   \[
   75 = 3D - D
   \]
   \[
   75 = 2D
   \]
   \[
   D = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5
   \]

6. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet.
   - Since 75 years have passed between the two sightings, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is:
   \[
   37.5 - 75 = -37.5
   \]
   This result is not possible because age cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and the interpretation of the ages.

Given the problem's context, it's more likely that the ages are whole numbers. Let's re-evaluate with the assumption that the ages are whole numbers.

If Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times 30, which is 90 years old:
\[
90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are four quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all howls combined:

\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's new trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for his appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours (120 minutes)
3. **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

**2:00 pm**"

   - Number of chocolate bars per box = \(\frac{64}{8} = 8\)

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per session for the studio.**

The cost per session includes the rental cost of the studio and the cost per student per session.
- Rental cost per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10

Total cost per session = Rental cost per session + (Cost per student per session × Number of students)
\[ \text{Total cost per session} = 25 + (1.50 \times 10) = 25 + 15 = 40 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.**

The studio is rented 3 days a week.
\[ \text{Total cost per day} = \text{Total cost per session} \times 3 = 40 \times 3 = 120 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.**

Assuming the studio operates 4 weeks in a month.
\[ \text{Total cost per week} = \text{Total cost per day} \times 4 = 120 \times 4 = 480 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.**

\[ \text{Total cost per month} = \text{Total cost per week} \times 4 = 480 \times 4 = 1920 \]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1920."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\).

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by Matteo.**
- Speed of Matteo: 55 miles per hour
- Time traveled by Matteo: 4 hours

Using the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by Shandy.**
- Speed of Shandy: 45 miles per hour
- Time traveled by Shandy: 10 hours

Using the same formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.**
\[ \text{Difference in distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference in distance} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**

   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**

   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( C \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. Therefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times (0.91)^5 \]

After 5 hours, the power bank continues to lose 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after the next 3 hours can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \approx 0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5018 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.5018 \approx 0.28 \]

This approximation is close enough for the purpose of solving the problem. Now, we need to find the initial charge \( C \) when the power bank went to the park. Since the charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge after 8 hours, we can directly use the given information:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28C \]

Since the equation holds true, the initial charge \( C \) is the charge we are looking for. Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was:
\[ \boxed{100\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works per week:

- Hours worked per week: 40

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, we need to determine how much Janet wants to save for the down payment on the car. She wants to save 20% of the $10000 car:

- Down payment needed: 20% of $10000

Down payment = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, we calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, given her weekly earnings of $1000:

- Total savings needed: $2000
- Weekly earnings: $1000/week

Number of weeks needed = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed the sweets equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \( \boxed{139} \) dollars."

   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. **Additional Check-ins After Dinner**: 7 more people check in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

The hotel now has \(\boxed{98}\) guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of average and difficult questions combined: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions is the same as the number of difficult questions, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) each.

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  24 \times 0.75 = 18
  \]
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9
  \]
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9
  \]

Now, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[
18 + 9 + 9 = 36
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
- The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
- The price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

According to the problem:
- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( S = 2L \).
- She earned a total of $120 from the sales.

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \):
\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one day:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

- Earnings from cookies: \(80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80\)
- Earnings from cupcakes: \(60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240\)

Adding these together gives the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to subtract the amount given to her two sisters:
\[ \$320 - (2 \times \$10) = \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

This means that the number of eggs left to be found by their friends is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs found by the friends is:

"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

4. The amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month is:
   \[
   36 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
   \]
5. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   1080 \text{ pounds/dwarf} \times 40 \text{ dwarves} = 43200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

1. **First Package:**
   - 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars.

2. **Second Package:**
   - 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

3. **Third Package:**
   - 8 sandwiches.
   - Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars.

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As Sally neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons (15 red, 6 yellow):

\[ 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given a substitute teacher: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher gives an extension: 0%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher does not give an extension but Marcus gets a personal extension: 0%

4. **Normal Teacher without Extension and No Personal Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher does not give an extension and Marcus does not get a personal extension: 100% or 1

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.4 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting a personal extension and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension, Marcus not getting a personal extension, and having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 \times 1 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[0 + 0 + 0 + 0.24 = 0.24\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[0.24 \times 100 = 24\%\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is \(\boxed{24\%}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. After reserving 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the graduates. If we let \( n \) be the number of graduates, then each graduate would receive:

\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

Since the question does not specify the number of graduates, we can only express the answer in terms of \( n \). However, if we assume the question is asking for the number of tickets each graduate would receive if the tickets are split equally among all graduates, the final numerical answer in terms of \( n \) is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{4750}{n}} \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat \(\boxed{450}\) small jelly beans."
"First, calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To drop the candy in all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 moves (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds/move} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, determine how many packs of apples he can make by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

"First, calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- Cost of Parmesan cheese per pound = $11
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese
- Total cost of Parmesan cheese = 2 pounds * $11/pound = $22

Next, calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- Cost of Mozzarella cheese per pound = $6
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of Mozzarella cheese = 3 pounds * $6/pound = $18

Now, calculate the total cost of both types of cheese:
- Total cost of cheese = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40

Finally, calculate the remaining money after the purchase:
- Amor starts with $50
- Total cost of cheese = $40
- Remaining money = $50 - $40 = $10

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is $10."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college:

\[ \text{Total loans} = 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After earning his degree, his income tripled:

\[ \text{Income after college} = 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \text{ per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college for 4 years:

\[ \text{Income lost} = 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the income lost is:

\[ \text{Total amount to earn} = \$200,000 \text{ (loans)} + \$100,000 \text{ (income lost)} = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take Jim to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000 per year:

\[ \text{Time to earn} = \frac{\$300,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race = $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race = \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\).
   - Win in the second race = $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race = \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).
   - Loss in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
  \[
  \text{Total loss} = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5
  \]

- Total win = Win in the second race
  \[
  \text{Total win} = 11
  \]

- Net result = Total win - Total loss
  \[
  \text{Net result} = 11 - 21.5 = -10.5
  \]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17
\]

Therefore, the average loss per race is approximately $7.17."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the heights are initially given in inches and feet.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked per day:**
   - They worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked per day is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked over the 3 weeks:**
   - Each painter worked 9 hours per day.
   - They worked for 21 days.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n \) is 3 years.

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the value after the first year:
\[ \text{Value after 1 year} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

2. Calculate the value after the second year:
\[ \text{Value after 2 years} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

3. Calculate the value after the third year:
\[ \text{Value after 3 years} = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9831.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9831.78} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. 

The total distance driven so far is:
\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive:
\[ \boxed{655} \text{ kilometers} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Romeo boards a train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. The total number of people on the train now is:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100 people) board the train. The total number of people on the train now is:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. The total number of people on the train now is:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}
\]"
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank Top**: $10
2. **Running Shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis Shoes**: Originally $48, on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic Socks**: Package costs $8, but with a $2 coupon, the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank Top: $10
- Running Shorts: $15
- Tennis Shoes: $24
- Athletic Socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\$2400\)."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week, so 4 twin sheets per week.
- 1 king size bed every week, so 1 king sheet per week.

In a year (52 weeks), the total number of sheets used is:
- Twin sheets: \(4 \times 52 = 208\)
- King sheets: \(1 \times 52 = 52\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do based on the machine's capacity:
- The machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
- The machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \div 2 = 104\) loads

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \div 1 = 52\) loads

Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year:
- \(104 + 52 = 156\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, on Sunday, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies on Saturday and Sunday combined: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**

"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Stickers from two years ago**: Leo had 100 stickers.
2. **Stickers collected last year**: Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. **Stickers collected this year**: Leo collected twice the number of stickers as last year. Therefore, he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year to find the total number of stickers in his collection:

\[
100 \text{ (two years ago)} + 50 \text{ (last year)} + 100 \text{ (this year)} = 250
\]

Thus, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]

Given that Becky ate 10 slices:

\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]

Solving for Jake's slices:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs for each item:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The cost is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:

"First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a response, so James needs to respond to the remaining emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. Over a 5-day work week, the number of emails he responds to is:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we add the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. John's score for the first 3 tests: \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\)
2. John's score for the 4th test: \(80\)

Adding these together gives the total score:
\[300 + 80 = 380\]

Now, to find the average, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
\[\text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95\]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(95\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine the number of meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs from the initial order plus the additional meatballs from the new order.
   - \(12 \text{ meatballs} + 12 \text{ meatballs} = 24 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's break down the cost calculation:

1. **Cost without promotion:**
   - Without any promotion, 6 pounds of butter would cost \(6 \times \$4.00 = \$24.00\).

2. **Cost with promotion:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - Therefore, for every 1.5 pounds of butter, he pays for 1 pound at full price and 0.5 pounds at half price.
   - The cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is \(1 \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - To get 6 pounds of butter, he needs to buy 4.5 pounds (since 6 pounds is equivalent to 4.5 pounds at the promotion rate of 1.5 pounds per unit cost).
   - The cost for 4.5 pounds of butter is \(4.5 \times \$6.00 / 1.5 = 3 \times \$6.00 = \$18.00\).

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is \(\$18.00\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will attend the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. The number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 guests * $6/guest = $126

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's original money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's original money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's original money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's original money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's original money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's original money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Maggie has $60 left.
Riza has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), and he buys 315 bananas, we can find out how many bananas are consumed by all three monkeys each day by dividing the total number of bananas by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we know that the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day is 45. Since the first two monkeys together consume 24 bananas each day, the number of bananas consumed by the third monkey each day is:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed an additional 500 pieces.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so the total amount of money she has is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot make the purchase and will not receive any change.

Thus, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from her goal:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 \]
\[ = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 \]
\[ = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 \]
\[ = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount amount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is **72000**."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since his home is 4 miles from the store). He then walked back home, covering another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.

The total distance James walked is:
2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 6 miles

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."

"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time spent in classes from Monday to Friday. Now, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours.

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.

2. **Second Child:**
   - Height: 2 inches taller than the first child
   - Calculation: \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \)

3. **Third Child:**
   - Height: 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - Calculation: \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - Height: 3 inches taller than the third child
   - Calculation: \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags sold.**

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops initially had 1080 kilograms of meat.

"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Ellen started with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shook 3 of them.
- She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- Now, there are 2 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. After he takes the sodas, the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 2 - 2 = 0

So, there are now 2 shaken sodas left and no unshaken sodas. Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 of the remaining sodas. Since there are no unshaken sodas left, the only option is to take a shaken soda. Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 100%.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to determine how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off.

- 20% of 50 days is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\) days.

So, the number of days Billy works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

- \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Finally, the total number of people he helps over the 40 days is:

- \(6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, as these are the people who attended the ceremony.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, each day, Bobby spends:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:

   - Total revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg. If Pierre and Paul take 7 kg, the remaining amount for Jacques (and any other person, like James, who is not specified in the problem but implied to be the one left with the rest) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He then spent $5 on a comic book.
4. He spent another $19 on a puzzle.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Raymond had after saving from his allowance:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost \(\boxed{5}\)."

Next, add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the blinking rate per minute:
\[ \text{Blinking rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We use the blinking rate to set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

9 minutes"

- Total female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (new) = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (new) = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, let's calculate how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = 19 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance per month = 2 × Round trip distance
   - Total distance per month = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{\text{Distance Sofie walks in 7 days}}{2} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production of these four workers during their 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total production of these four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys during the 10-hour shift.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.
2. **Kris had 16 stickers, which is half of what Luis gave her.** Therefore, Luis gave Kris \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. **Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth and gave the rest to Kris.** This means the 32 stickers Luis gave to Kris were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth originally had **64 stickers**."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

- John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces:

- Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&M, 30 ounces will contain \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&M.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag:

- The total number of small bags is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \).

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags.

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. 

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Vince is currently 9 years old. 

Vince is currently 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the expression for \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \(S = 9\), we can find \(C\):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we can find the mother's earnings:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk at this speed:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved in the past 8 weeks. Since she saves $4 every week, we can multiply the weekly savings by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Jane needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week. We divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

2. **Calculate the number of blue birds in the next 2 trees:**
   - Each of these 2 trees has 4 blue birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue birds in these 2 trees is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Calculate the number of blue birds in the final tree:**
   - This tree has 3 blue birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue birds in this tree is \(3\).

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, the equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has is:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) is:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 days = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times 40 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of scoops per potato:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be broken down as:
     - 3 less than 6 potatoes: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
     - 1 less than 3 scoops: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops can be calculated as:
     - First, find the number of sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) sets.
     - Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, the total number of potatoes needed is: \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \) potatoes.

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees over a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Each tree yields 6 lemons per year. Therefore, for one tree, the number of lemons in one year is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \]

Step 2: Tim grows 5 trees. So, the total number of lemons from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 3: A decade is 10 years. Therefore, the total number of lemons collected over 10 years is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of men and women on the bus initially, and then account for the 20 women who alight at the next stop.

1. **Determine the total parts of the ratio:**
   The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means there are 5 parts men and 9 parts women, making a total of 14 parts.

2. **Calculate the value of one part:**
   The total number of passengers is 84. Since the total parts of the ratio are 14, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio.
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of men and women:**
   - Number of men = 5 parts \(\times\) 6 = 30
   - Number of women = 9 parts \(\times\) 6 = 54

4. **Account for the women who alight:**
   If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
   \[
   54 - 20 = 34
   \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
     \]
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291 \text{ sunflowers}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - The probability of both events happening (both tickets being winners) is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the combined probability is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the combined probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.
   - \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

Therefore, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots from Monday to Friday.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots on the weekend.

Adding the carrots from weekdays and the weekend, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots a week.

"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need to produce 5 bottles of juice (since \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \)).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:

- Total number of octuplets: 8
- Number dressed in purple: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
- Number dressed in blue: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Next, we calculate how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- Number of blue-wearers wearing bows: \(2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1)
- Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\)

Now, we find the total number of octuplets wearing bows:

- Total number of bow-wearers: \(1 + 2 = 3\)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of bow-wearers, multiplied by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\%

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold this 40 square meters for $50. 

Next, we need to determine how much land he has left after the first sale:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Then, he sold a quarter of the remaining 40 square meters:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold these 10 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land he has left after the second sale:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 36 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Next, we sum up the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350

\[ \text{Jack's total amount} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting this into the first relationship gives \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount of money Ronnie has left is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Day 1 (Tuesday): 
     - Remaining chalk = \( 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.2 \) inches.
   - Day 2 (Wednesday):
     - Remaining chalk = \( 2.2 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.2 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.
   - Day 3 (Thursday):
     - Remaining chalk = \( 1.76 \times (1 - 0.20) = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \) inches.
   - Day 4 (Friday):
     - Remaining chalk = \( 1.408 \times (1 - 0.20) = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \) inches.
   - Day 5 (Saturday):
     - Remaining chalk = \( 1.1264 \times (1 - 0.20) = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \) inches.

4. **Determine when the chalk needs to be recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - On Saturday, the remaining chalk is 0.90112 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, we can find the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

The total number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students} = 17 \text{ students} \]

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the refund for 1600 gallons is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7)
\]

Simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Distribute the 3 and 5:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[

"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

\[ \text{Number of sets of 100 books} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each set of 100 books is bought for $500, and he has enough money to buy 54 such sets, he can buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, since the $27000 is distributed equally among 3 schools, we need to find out how many books each school can buy. We divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one into the tree.

2. **First Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket, throwing the remaining one back at the tree.

3. **Second Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple back at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket, so he had 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the first throw, he picked up 5 apples and put 4 in his pocket, so he had 1 + 4 = 5 apples in his pocket.
- After the second throw, he picked up 6 apples and put all 6 in his pocket.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 5 (from the first throw) + 6 (from the second throw) = 11 apples.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, Kate needs to buy:
- \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\).

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes).

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In 1 hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which means \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt in 1 hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs but loses 8 snowballs due to melting.
   - Net rate of snowball accumulation = \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs per hour.

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to have 60 snowballs, we use the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour.
   - Time required = \( \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the exact year Digimon came out, we can assume that the current year is the 20th anniversary year. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) years old 20 years ago.

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since Jim was 4 years old, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 - 28 + 16 = x\)
- After the third day: \(x + 100 - 25 = x + 75\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages, so:
\[x + 75 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 75\]
\[x = 3\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, which had 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and Amy uses up half of them.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - After using up 3 colors from one set, the remaining colors from that set are:
     \[
     6 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - The total number of colors from the remaining two sets and the reduced set is:
     \[
     3 \text{ colors from the reduced set} + 12 \text{ colors from the other two sets} = 15 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Adding the remaining colors from the palettes:
     \[
     15 \text{ colors} + 4 \text{ colors from the remaining palettes} = 19 \text{ colors}
     \]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches high, the remaining height is the space from the first floor's ceiling to the roof, which is the height of the second floor.

Height of the second floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor's ceiling = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.

240"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram. 

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

\[ \text{Final Answer: } 64 \]"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, we determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's class is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the 2% interest on the $300 borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen owes is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is also:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, it is already over capacity with 270 people on board. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 0, as the bus is already at full capacity and over.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made to the museum over the 8 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she made:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

For the next 3 years, she continued to visit 3 times a year:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

So, the total number of visits over 8 years is:
\[ 15 \text{ visits} + 9 \text{ visits} = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
\[ 2 + (150\% \times 2) = 2 + (1.5 \times 2) = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all 24 visits at the new cost of $5 per visit:
\[ 24 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who get to try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide the total number of students by the group size:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, and each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time required is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - Each minute costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The call is 36 minutes in total, so the remaining minutes = 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes.
   - Each minute after 16 minutes costs $0.20.
   - Total cost for 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."

"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he drives continuously for 24 hours each day), the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes at the beginning by adding the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School.

\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs Bud incurs for making macaroni and cheese each week:

1. **Pasta cost**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cheddar cheese cost**: $3.00.
3. **Gruyere cheese cost**: Twice the amount spent on cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's calculate the total weekly cost:
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Pasta cost} + \text{Cheddar cheese cost} + \text{Gruyere cheese cost} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can determine the average time spent cleaning per day:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Finally, to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the following formula:

\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes/day}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer: 2**"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell from 60 eggs. This is calculated as:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Rose sells each set of 3 eggs for $1. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price of a bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions from both tests.

The first test has 70 questions, and she needs to get 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \text{ questions correct} \]

The second test has 40 questions. Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test as \( x \).

The total number of questions from both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of these 110 questions correct:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \text{ questions correct} \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct from the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ t = \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{speaking speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate is three times the initial rate.
   - \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels pop.

3. **Following 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate is four times the initial rate.
   - \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels pop.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds.
   - \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels pop.

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat.

   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - For 4 gallons, the total lemon juice needed is \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups}\).

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon:**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, so it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the extra gallon needs \(2 \text{ cups}\).

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon
   - Total lemon juice = \(4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Convert the total lemon juice needed into lemons:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of juice, the number of lemons needed is \(6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons}\).

**Final Answer:**
Tim will need 36 lemons."

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 since a pair consists of 2 legs.

First, calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
\[ 10 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ legs/animal} = 20 \text{ legs} \]

Next, calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
\[ 15 \text{ animals} \times 4 \text{ legs/animal} = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Now, add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 \text{ legs} + 60 \text{ legs} = 80 \text{ legs} \]

Finally, to find the number of pairs of legs, divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ legs}}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the tower is made up of 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."

Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars = $6 * 10 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent at the mall.

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount given by her parents:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has \(\boxed{13}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week:
- Cars serviced per day: 3
- Days open per week: 5
- Total cars serviced per week: \(3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week}\)

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, 6 toys will be sold at $5 each, and the other 6 toys will be sold at $7 each.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate fills each day. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, so the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

The final answer is:

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs. 

Adding the eggs from both baskets together: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half as far as Vanessa, Aaron ran:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, Aaron's speed is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the time she took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total required.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line required.
The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. With 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line. So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total cost for one night is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night, considering all reservations, is \(6 \times 15 = \$90\).

If the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(90 \times 2 = \$180\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\$180
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, calculate the discounted price of the radiator:
- The original price of the radiator is $400.
- He gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.
- 20% of $400 is calculated as \( 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \).

Next, calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic:
- The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours.
- The total cost for the mechanic is \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \).

Finally, add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
- Total cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of mechanic's work
- Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230.

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

To find out how many slices each person can have, divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
