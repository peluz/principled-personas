"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. 150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

Step 1: Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Step 2: The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. The price of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = \$3\).

Now, let's break down the 16 glasses into two categories: the first glass in each pair and the second glass in each pair.

- For the first glass in each pair, Kylar will pay $5 for each of the 8 pairs (since 16 glasses divided by 2 is 8).
- For the second glass in each pair, Kylar will pay $3 for each of the 8 pairs.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 5 + 8 \times 3 = 40 + 24 = \$64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. Let's start with the number of sheep in Seattle. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[ 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Sum of the times from the above steps: \( 40 \) minutes (first 40%) + \( 20 \) minutes (Windows update) + \( 60 \) minutes (remaining 60%) = \( 120 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in standstill - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first leg + Distance of return trip = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is the total distance he has traveled minus the initial 180 miles he drove away from home.
   - Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance = 315 miles - 180 miles = 135 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 135 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate her earnings:

- Earnings from regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Earnings from overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- Cost to plant the tree: $90 (one-time cost)
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3

Next, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Number of lemons grown per year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5

Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
- Number of years to break even = Initial cost / Net profit per year
- Number of years to break even = $90 / $7.5 = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. After selling to the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there.
5. After selling to the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, the equation representing the remaining vacuum cleaners is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:

\[
2x = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance enrollments:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's find the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Using the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time, we can rearrange it to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles) walking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour. Using the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:

\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - The remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
3. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. So, he stopped at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the mileages of these two stops:
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average.

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3:

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on each dog.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \] points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Total points scored by Mike:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total money from selling lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on video games plus the money he has left equals the total money he got from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since the total money from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, we can find out how much money he has left over from the lego sales by subtracting the amount spent on video games and the remaining money from the total:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \]

This $30 is the money he would have if he had not bought any video games, but since he still has 13 lego sets and has sold all of them, he has no lego sets left. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and this is half as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in the six-hour period. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking.

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \text{ miles} \]"
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin. Since 1200 feet is outside the dragon's reach, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram of chips is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, for 20 candles, he needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days: 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package she purchased.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Remaining Post-it notes: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + 23) - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 103 - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = -117 \]

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach should be:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package}) - 220 \]

Given that she had 23 remaining:

\[ 80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 23 + 220 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches
So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have also had kittens. 

Trixie has had 12 kittens. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Now, we add the kittens from the shelter and the house cats together:

- Shelter kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

Total number of kittens = \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is 40."

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the available weight for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how much Janet paid in total, we need to add the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the cost of insurance.

1. The cost of the material is $500.
2. The cost of construction is $800.
3. The cost of insurance is 10% of the total cost of material and construction.

First, we calculate the total cost of material and construction:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate 10% of $1300 for the insurance:
\[ 10\% \times 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of material and construction:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the standard pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension amount is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension will be:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the increased pension amount for the remaining 10 years of her service. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
\[ 52,500 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 52,500 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays the full monthly rate of $140 for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than the full monthly rate, which is $140 - (10% of $140).

Let's calculate each part:

1. First half of the year:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

2. Second half of the year:
\[ 140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles driven by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also has 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we add up all the gems:
\[175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595\]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students.

First, let's find the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- So, the total amount of money she makes is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

"To calculate the total money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
The interest rate is 2% per unit, and there are 5 units.
Total interest = 5 * $150 * 2% = $150 * 0.02 * 5 = $15

Step 3: Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
Final amount = Total cost before interest + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Final amount / 3 = $765 / 3 = $255

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Level 4: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average square footage} = 7.5 \]

The average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days of the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ bags} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**

"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way (either in packages of 3 or in packages of 2) with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.

The difference in cost, which represents the savings, is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the final cost after the discount, we first need to find out how much the 30% discount is on the $100 grooming cost.

30% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the final cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang over the three instances.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up the total number of times the alarm rang:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary after each of the next three years, given the 10% annual increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for 5 years.

The formula for the salary after \( n \) years with an annual increase of \( r \) is:
\[ \text{Salary after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + r)^n \]

Here, the initial salary is $600, the annual increase \( r \) is 0.10, and \( n \) is 5.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 966.306 \]

So, after 5 years, Sylvie's monthly salary is approximately $966.31.

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after each of the next three years.**

Now, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years, with a 10% increase each year.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 966.31 \times (1 + 0.10)^1 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 966.31 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 1062.941 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1062.941 \times (1 + 0.10)^1 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1062.941 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1169.2351 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1169.2351 \times (1 + 0.10)^1 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1169.2351 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1286.15861 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is approximately $1286.16 per month. To find the annual salary, we multiply by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 1286.16 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 15433.92 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $15,433.92."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of friends who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for 9 gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
2. A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat \(10 \div 2 = 5\) lbs of potato salad.

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children:

- For the 20 adults: \(20 \times 10 = 200\) lbs.
- For the 5 children: \(5 \times 5 = 25\) lbs.

Adding these together gives the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[200 + 25 = 225\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"To find out how old Jackson is, let's use the information given to set up equations and solve for Jackson's age.

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10% of his original time. We can calculate the reduction in time as:

\[ \text{Reduction in time} = 10\% \times \text{Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald's new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Reduction in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"Harry slept 9 hours.

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has before receiving the new ones is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. So, the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these numbers.

2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages to be read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but he has a soda with dinner instead of water. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26 glasses of water.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given to set up a proportion.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then solve for \(x\):

\[
3x = 42 \times 10
\]

\[
3x = 420
\]

\[
x = \frac{420}{3}
\]

\[
x = 140
\]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"First, let's calculate how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, 250 pieces are placed on the board by Poppy. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

So, her mom places 250 more pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 500 \]"
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, which is 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1 hour each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\) hours.

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 - 5.5 = 1.5\) hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5.

- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\).

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final answer**: 3"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the final cost after the cashback, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final amount.

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Final amount after cashback
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

The final amount for 10 gallons of gas, after the cashback rewards, is \$28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Next, we add the number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell to find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
45"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can calculate the rate at which she rows in feet per second:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet, we use the ratio:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Total cost of all boards:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board at the same price she bought it for, which is $10.
   - Total revenue for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board at the same price she bought it for, which is $16.
   - Total revenue for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Total revenue from all boards:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2x4x10 boards + Revenue from 4x4x10 boards
   - Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes John buys: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary was \( L \), then Adrien's salary four years ago was:
   \[ L \times (1 + 0.30) = 1.30L \]
   Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:
   \[ 1.30L = 40,000 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[ 30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94 \]

5. Now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
   \[ 56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper.

So, in a week, he uses:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a month as follows:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours

"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, the distance she covers in the first 3 hours is:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the distance she covers in the next 4 hours is:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of her run gives the total distance:

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Total amount of money he will spend: $880.**"
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit, so we subtract 20 from the initial 60:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40

$500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940

Therefore, his total expenditure for those two months was $940."
"Pam and Fred each rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

For the roller coaster:
- Pam rode 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Fred rode 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.

For the luge:
- Both Pam and Fred rode 2 times each, so together they used \(2 \times 6 + 2 \times 6 = 12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Adding the tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge:
- Total tickets used = \(12 + 24 + 24 = 60\).

Therefore, they used 60 tickets that day."
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

Step 1: Monthly cost of car washes
Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15.
So, the monthly cost is \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.

Step 2: Annual cost
There are 12 months in a year, so the annual cost is \(60 \times 12 = 720\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games before the comparison with Bobby.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has, which is 3 * 15 = 45.

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has: 45 - 5 = 40.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

Next, calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Add the tip:
\[ \$4.00 + \$5.00 = \$9.00 \]

Finally, add the delivery fee and the tip to the subtotal to get the final cost:
\[ \$20.00 + \$9.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \$29.00 \]"
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Next, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ \frac{4B}{2} + \frac{2B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Solving for B:
\[ 7B = 1400 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Now, using the relationship \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, since Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, we can calculate how much money he would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games:

$10/hour * 14 hours = $140

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:

- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:

Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:

10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:

- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

Total cost = 5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food with tax) = 16 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of everything is 16 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

Finally, we calculate the profit:

- Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
- Therefore, the profit is \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = (Pineapples per hectare per harvest) * (Number of hectares) * (Number of harvests in a year)
- Total pineapples = 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares * 4 harvests/year
- Total pineapples = 100 * 10 * 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return. That means 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees return.

So, in the last 6 hours, Debra sees 90 bees return to the hive.

90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost for 1 child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for both tickets is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8.

Let's denote the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier as \( x \).

So, we have:
\( x - $22 = $8 \)

To find \( x \), we add $22 to both sides of the equation:
\( x = $8 + $22 \)
\( x = $30 \)

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Now, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in their times is:

- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, we get 500 cents / 100 = $5.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5 that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (5 + 1).
3. **Before the raccoon took two-thirds**: The raccoon took two-thirds, so one-third was left. If one-third is 6, then the total before the raccoon took fries was \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
4. **Before the pigeons ate**: The pigeons each ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate twice what the seagull ate. If the seagull ate 14 fries (the same as Dave), then Dave ate \(14 \times 2 = 28\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were \(27 + 28 = 55\) fries.

So, the final numerical answer is:

55 fries."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days with three 1-hour classes:
- Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each have 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- So, for each of these days, he spends 3 hours in class.
- There are 3 such days in a week, so the total for these days is \(3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\).

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days with two 2-hour classes:
- Tuesday and Thursday each have 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- So, for each of these days, he spends \(2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes} = 4 \text{ hours/day}\).
- There are 2 such days in a week, so the total for these days is \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\).

Now, let's add the hours for the entire week:
- Total hours per week = \(9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\).

Finally, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- So, the total hours in one semester is \(17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Total length of baguettes in feet: \(60 \times 2 = 120\) feet.

Now, we need to convert the lengths of rolls and croissants to feet to add them to the length of the baguettes. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Total length of rolls in feet: \(\frac{1200}{12} = 100\) feet.
- Total length of croissants in feet: \(\frac{720}{12} = 60\) feet.

Adding all the lengths together:
- Total length in feet: \(100 + 60 + 120 = 280\) feet.

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
2. Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
3. Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed for one month:

\[ \text{Total bananas per month} = 200 \, (\text{monkeys}) + 400 \, (\text{gorillas}) + 100 \, (\text{baboons}) = 700 \, \text{bananas} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to double the monthly requirement:

\[ \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 700 \, \text{bananas/month} \times 2 \, \text{months} = 1400 \, \text{bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so:

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of each item he bought and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
2. The cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
3. The cost of the rim of bond paper: $20

Now, we add up all these costs:

$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, which means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, he can see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, he can see 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish.
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.

So, the total number of fish caught by Anakin is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

So, the total number of fish caught by Locsin is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, to find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add the totals together:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So, the price will increase 18 times.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the final price after 18 increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{\text{Number of Increases}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $787.32."
"Given the information:

1. One red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. An action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- 1 doll, costing $15.

Adding these up, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:

   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Lost income from doing taxes herself: $105
   - Cost of hiring the accountant: $90

4. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of hiring the accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs needed by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ 45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs/babysitting} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Final answer: 16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:

   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders = 80 * 8 = 640 legs.

2. For the insects:
   - There are 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects = 90 * 6 = 540 legs.

3. For the rare mutant invertebrates:
   - There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = 640 (spiders) + 540 (insects) + 30 (rare mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- The age of the fourth bird (Caboose) is not given, so we assume it's the same as Sally Thirtytwo, which is 8 years.

Adding these ages together:

\[19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\]

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to determine the total minimum monthly payment and then calculate 50% more than that amount. Finally, we'll multiply the increased monthly payment by 12 to find the annual payment.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   - Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   - Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the annual payment:
   - Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the peeling time is \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the cutting time is \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds is \( \frac{60 \times 5}{60} \) minutes.

Let's do the math:

Peeling time: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes

Cutting time: \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) seconds, which is \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes

Total time: \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon of lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Determine the profit per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons they sold:**
   - They made a total profit of $25
   - Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Determine the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons: Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars.
2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much is left after these expenses.

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: \( 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \) dollars.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

Donation to charity: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much is left after the donation.

Remaining amount after donation: \( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \) dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700 for their expenses.

Total given to daughter and wife: \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations.

Final amount: \( 1250 - 900 = 350 \) dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will still have $350 after all these expenses and donations."
"Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.

"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Jean is two years older than Mark, so if we let Mark's age be \( M \), then Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's find out how old Jan was two years ago:
- Jan's current age is 30, so two years ago, Jan was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \) years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago is:
- \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than this value:
- So, Mark's age two years ago was \( 14 + 5 = 19 \).

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
- Mark's current age is \( 19 + 2 = 21 \).

Since Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age is \( 21 + 2 = 23 \).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team completes the race in 220 seconds, while the less well-rounded team takes 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer: 200%**"

They both picked 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

4. **Straw used for rats:**
   - Total straw - Straw for hamsters - Straw for rabbits = Straw for rats
   - 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw for rats.

5. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 90 / 6 = 15 rats.
   - Since these 15 rats are in 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

1. **First Month:**
   - Interest = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
   - Total after 1st month = $100 + $2 = $102

2. **Second Month:**
   - Interest = $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
   - Total after 2nd month = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

3. **Third Month:**
   - Interest = $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
   - Total after 3rd month = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags the trader sold. Let's denote the number of bags as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The cost per bag is $20, so the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the bags**: The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost**: The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying the bags and the transportation cost, which is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of years**: 10 years.
4. **Total increase in trees over 10 years**: \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.
5. **Total number of trees after 10 years before any die**: \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
6. **Percentage of trees that die**: 30%.
7. **Number of trees that die**: \(30\% \times 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's sum up all the cards she has:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month

She then bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:

6 (bags) * 9 (pens per bag) = 54 blue pens

Additionally, she bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

2 (bags) * 6 (pens per bag) = 12 red pens

Now, to find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial pens to the blue and red pens:

32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

So, Janet has 98 pens now."
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 5 tests (since the lowest score will be dropped).
2. Determine the sum of the scores she has already achieved.
3. Calculate the score she needs on the sixth test to reach the required sum after dropping the lowest score.

First, let's calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 5 tests. The formula for the average is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over 5 tests, the sum of the scores should be:

\[ 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

Next, we calculate the sum of the scores Brinley has already achieved:

\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

To find out the score she needs on the sixth test, we need to consider that the lowest score will be dropped. The lowest score among the first five tests is 71. So, we subtract 71 from the required sum of 465 and then add the sum of the remaining four scores:

\[ 465 - 71 + 438 - 438 = 465 - 71 = 394 \]

Now, we need to find the score \( x \) on the sixth test such that the sum of the four highest scores plus \( x \) equals 465. The sum of the four highest scores is:

\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

So, we need:

\[ 367 + x = 465 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 465 - 367 = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the following equation:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 70 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by each of the other students and then subtract their total from the overall score.

1. **Naomi's Score:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Score:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this gives Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \).

3. **Brianna's Score:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \).

4. **Total Points Scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   Adding up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \).

5. **Jojo's Score:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. Subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total gives Jojo's score: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \).

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent on these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Time to finish one crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles solved = 3
- Total time for crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Time to finish one Sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of Sudoku puzzles solved = 8
- Total time for Sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on both activities:
- Total time spent = Time for crossword puzzles + Time for Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months:**
   - 30% of 120 watermelons are ready for harvest.
   - \( 30\% \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons.

2. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the ready ones:**
   - Total watermelons - watermelons taken by Ashlyn = remaining watermelons.
   - \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons.

3. **Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks:**
   - 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.

4. **Calculate the number of watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks:**
   - Remaining watermelons - watermelons taken by Ashlyn after two weeks = watermelons not ready.
   - \( 84 - 63 = 21 \) watermelons.

So, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has at least 5 empty pens.

3. **Calculating the Number of New Pens**: 
   - From the first 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
   - Now, he has 5 new pens and 20 pens that are still empty (since 25 - 5 = 20).

4. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: 
   - He can now mix the ink from these 20 empty pens with the 5 new pens to make more new pens. He can make 20 / 5 = 4 new pens.
   - Now, he has 4 new pens and 5 pens that are still empty (since 20 - 20 = 0, but he has 5 new pens from the previous cycle).

5. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: 
   - He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens with the 4 new pens to make 1 more new pen.
   - Now, he has 1 new pen and 4 pens that are still empty (since 5 - 5 = 0, but he has 1 new pen from the previous cycle).

6. **Final Count**: 
   - Adding up all the pens, he has the original 25 pens, plus 5 from the first cycle, plus 4 from the second cycle, plus 1 from the third cycle.
   - Total pens = 25 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 35.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 35."
"Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10, so he had:

1. **Number of students who went out through exit A:**
   30% of 1000 students went out through exit A.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. **Number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remained.

3. **Number of students who went out through exit B:**
   3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. **Number of students who went out through exit C:**
   The rest of the students went out through exit C.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]
   So, 280 students went out through exit C.

**Final numerical answer:**
280"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read:
- Her own 2 books
- Pandora's 1 book

Pandora will read:
- Her own 1 book
- Dolly's 2 books

So, the total number of books read by Dolly is 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
The total number of books read by Pandora is 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, he receives 30 pages a week (3 people * 10 pages).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.

To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total time spent writing 30 pages.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into three equal parts. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - There are 3 classes, each with 20 students.
   - Total students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students.

2. **Total number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.
   - Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Total girls in the school = 30 girls.
   - Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes = 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - Boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61:

61 - 9 = 52

Then he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52:

52 + 18 = 70

Therefore, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. 

To find the floor he ends up on, we calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6:

4 * 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"First, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply Anne's count by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\(22 \times 8 = 176\)

Therefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: 100 pennies are worth 100 * $0.01 = $1.00
2. **Nickels**: 40 nickels are worth 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
3. **Dimes**: 20 dimes are worth 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
4. **Dollar bills**: 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, we add up all these values:

$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so they ate:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea's total fruits: \(52 \text{ apples} + 24 \text{ bananas} = 76\)
- Jamal's total fruits: \(44 \text{ apples} + 48 \text{ bananas} = 92\)

The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted from the selling price:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

2. Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
   - There are 4 additional windows in each house.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

3. Add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
   - Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
   - Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

3. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can now calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

4. Subtract the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

5. Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

**Final numerical answer:**
138"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carly had 80 cards in total.
2. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. So, the number of cards with the letter A is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
   \]
3. The remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter A are:
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48
   \]
4. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, the number of cards with the letter B is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]
5. The remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter B are:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]
6. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. So, the number of cards with the letter C is:
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
   \]
7. The remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter C are the ones with the letter D. So, the number of cards with the letter D is:
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9
   \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9."
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to multiply the number of holes by the time it takes to dig each type of hole and then sum the results.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for small holes and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so the total increase in their combined age will be 10 + 10 = 20 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be the current sum of their ages (20) plus 20, which equals 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \text{Sam is 6 years old.} \]"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length available for the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads can fit into the 17 inches of space, we divide the available length by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is currently twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, we subtract the 36 stars from the other rows to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   - Total stars: 76
   - Stars in other rows: 36
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of medals given out:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate how much money Susan earns, we need to determine the total time she works and then multiply that by her rate of earning.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
3. Converting 2.5 hours into minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. So, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes: 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.
5. Therefore, the total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. A player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's sum up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

Final numerical answer:

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these totals together gives us the overall total count of activities:

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of rice for the household.
2. Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily consumption of rice for the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other three people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen made, including the initial bid and her subsequent bids:
   - Initial bid: $200
   - First bid: $300
   - Second bid: $350
   - Third bid: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1250 \]

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $1250."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Total distance per day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Days per week: 5
   - Weeks per year: 50
   - Total annual mileage: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total annual mileage cost: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Months per year: 12
   - Total annual bonus: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Total annual cost = Total annual mileage cost + Total annual bonus
   - Total annual cost = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding process and how the pages are arranged.

1. When you fold a piece of paper in half, you create two pages on the front and two pages on the back. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages in a tabloid format (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

2. For a 32-page tabloid, we need to find out how many sets of 4 pages can be printed from one piece of paper.

3. We divide the total number of pages by the number of pages that can be printed from one piece of paper:
   \[
   \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.

So, the amount left is $15."
"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

First, we know that Elise started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total over the three years.

We are also given that she sold 45 books in the current (third) year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[200 - 90 - 45 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is $1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings with the bonus.
4. Determine the number of weeks in April.
5. Calculate his total earnings for April.

Step 1: Watson's daily earnings
Watson earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day.
Daily earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day

Step 2: Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus
Watson works 5 days a week.
Weekly earnings without bonus = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Step 3: Watson's weekly earnings with the bonus
Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Step 4: Number of weeks in April
April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 5: Total earnings for April
Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

He lost to 4 people."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves remaining. Half of what is left is sold in the afternoon and evening. So, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up the following proportion based on the rate at which Sandy loses weight:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \frac{1 \text{ pound}}{2 \text{ weeks}} \]

So, to lose 8 pounds:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ weeks per pound} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

16 weeks"

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. So, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people eating three eggs each day:**
   - There are 3 people eating 3 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs these 3 people eat in a day:**
   - \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\)

3. **Identify the number of people eating two eggs each day:**
   - The family has 5 people in total, and 3 of them are already accounted for, so \(5 - 3 = 2 \text{ people}\) are eating 2 eggs each day.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs these 2 people eat in a day:**
   - \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\)

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs the entire family eats in a day:**
   - \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\)

6. **Calculate the total number of eggs the family eats in a week (7 days):**
   - \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\)

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:
120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually show up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

14"
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. He initially had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs."
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume is calculated as:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, the number of women who stayed can be calculated as follows:

30 (total people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed) = 8 women who stayed.

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we consider Meg's pencils. The problem states that Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which hold 24 pencils each), we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream added.

First, let's calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can find out how many ice cubes were added by dividing 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, 5 ice cubes were added. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the cream added. The problem states that any added liquid also weakens the coffee. Since 15 milliliters of cream were added, this adds an additional 15 milliliters of weakening.

Adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream gives us the total weakening:

\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Given that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their monthly salary is:

\[ \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

The total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points.

Time required = 40 percentage points × 3 minutes per percentage point
Time required = 120 minutes

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time required in hours = 120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour
Time required in hours = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she has:

She has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon applied twice the amount of the rewards off the price. So, the discount from the coupon is:

\[ \text{Discount from coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount to be paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job has a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
2. Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of cows.
- \( H \) as the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then add the results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two results together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies each day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats in a week is:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies her son and husband eat from the total number of cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies, which is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

$60 - $24 = $36

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue between the current and past production.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
- They sold 10 tractors a day at $100 each.
- Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
- They now sell 5 silos a day at $220 each.
- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue.
- Difference in daily revenue = $1100/day (silos) - $1000/day (tractors) = $100/day.

Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.
- Percentage increase = (Difference in daily revenue / Original daily revenue) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = $100\).
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = $1200\).

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - The yearly cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = $240\).

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - The yearly cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = $1200\).

Now, we sum up the yearly costs for food, treats, and medicine:
\[1200 + 240 + 1200 = $2640\]

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking class on Tuesday**: 3 times the yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
4. **Museum tour on Thursday**: Half the duration of the cooking class, so \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

Now, we add up all the hours:

\[1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8\]

Therefore, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours."
"April is donating plant pots for the school's garden. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. 

First, we calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots required:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

1. Andrea had $36 initially.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of the items:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the items, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the final amount of money Dean has is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in tokens)**: $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from her total budget to find out how much is left for her friends.

4. **Morgan's budget**: $90
5. **Cost for Morgan**: $30
6. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to pay $30 for the same activities. To find out how many friends can be invited, we divide the remaining money by the cost per friend.

7. **Number of friends**: $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

The amount she saves each day is the difference between her pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

So, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - After buying gumballs, he spent $2.00.
   - Change before buying gumballs = $10 - $2.00 = $8.00.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before spending half on gumballs:**
   - Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the $8.00 is half of the money he had before buying gumballs.
   - Therefore, the total money he had before buying gumballs = $8.00 * 2 = $16.00.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on candy:**
   - Total money before buying gumballs = $16.00.
   - Money spent on gumballs = $2.00.
   - Money spent on candy = $16.00 - $2.00 = $14.00.

5. **Determine the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $14.00 / $1.50 per pound = 14 / 1.5 = 9.3333 pounds.

Since we typically measure candy in whole or half pounds, and the problem doesn't specify rounding, we can present the answer as a decimal.

**Final Answer:**
Billy bought 9.3333 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of stuffing.

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds of stuffing.

4. **Add the amounts together to find the total amount of stuffing needed:**
   - Total stuffing for chihuahua beds: 8 pounds
   - Total stuffing for collie beds: 15 pounds
   - Total stuffing needed: \(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Distance: 220 miles (200 miles to the friend's house + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 220 miles / 70 mph = 3.142857 hours

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both legs of the trip:
- Total time = 3.142857 hours + 3 hours = 6.142857 hours

Rounding to two decimal places, the total time is approximately 6.14 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**
6.14 hours"
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the total of 42 points.

Jane's scores so far are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
15 + 18 = 33 points

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points:
42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \]"

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching for all picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total cost for etching = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,208.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,208."
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 pupils like blue.

2. Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 pupils remain.

3. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate one-fourth of 20:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 pupils like green.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 736.08 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $736.08 per month."

- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so 26 girls are initially planning to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 26 * 0.5 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate 1/3 of 66:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- Savings = Cost for Dasha - Cost for David
- Savings = $36 - $30
- Savings = $6

David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles, which is given as 165. So, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. 

The time spent editing is given as 90 minutes. We need to convert this to hours to make the units consistent. Since 60 minutes make an hour, 90 minutes is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."

"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

The net change in the number of cards she has is the cards she received minus the cards she gave away, which is \(17 - 29 = -12\).

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is \(50 - 29 - 12 = 9\).

"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, Mark gets:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten or given away from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, for 2 pounds, Sally gets the first pound at $3 and the second pound at half price, which is $1.50.

The cost of the taffy is:
\[ \$3 + \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each, so for 4 magnets, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the seashells and magnets to the cost of the taffy:
\[ \$4.50 + \$1.50 + \$1.00 = \$7.00 \]

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$7.00 = \$3.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the information provided does not specify the percentage of candles that explode. We only know that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and that Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 

Given that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, it implies that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. But we don't have a specific percentage of candles that are considered ""more dangerous"" or that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

Assuming that the 5% of ""more dangerous"" candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that are expected to explode, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as follows:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are ""more dangerous"" and smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

2. Assuming that all of these 2500 candles are part of the 1% that are expected to explode, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The regular price is $20, and the blouses are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount is 30% of $20.

\[ \text{Discount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

Final numerical answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so:

\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so:

\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, to find the size of Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Climbing distance = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Climbing distance = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has \(\boxed{17000}\) in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final numerical answer:
12 cats"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96 \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$256 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans."
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy the ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket, which is $100. So, the money he gets from selling the cards is $150 (because \( 150 - 50 = 100 \)).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. This means 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hot dogs each, which totals 36 hot dogs for these guests.

2. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: Since 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hot dogs each, the caterer prepared 36 hot dogs for these guests. The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hot dog each, so that's another 18 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs prepared was 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 18 (for the remaining 18 guests) = 54 hot dogs.

3. **Actual Guests and Consumption**: 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that 20 guests (half of 40) would need a second hot dog, and the other 20 guests would only need one hot dog each. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 (for the second hot dog for 20 guests) + 20 (for the first hot dog for the other 20 guests) = 40 hot dogs.

4. **Shortage Calculation**: The caterer prepared 54 hot dogs, but only 40 were needed. Therefore, the number of hot dogs left over is 54 - 40 = 14 hot dogs.

5. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since 20 guests wanted a second hot dog and there were 14 hot dogs left over, 20 - 14 = 6 guests did not get a second hot dog.

Final numerical answer:
6 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:

$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (total money Dora has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since 1% of his money was left after this purchase, the 120 cents represents 99% of the money he originally had. Let's denote the total amount of money George had as \( x \) cents. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{0.99} \approx 121.21 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had approximately 121.21 cents left, the amount he actually spent is:

\[ 500 - 121.21 \approx 378.79 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we need to determine how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. Let's denote the number of candy bars he bought as \( y \). The total cost for the candy bars is:

\[ 75y \]

The total amount spent on chips and candy bars is:

\[ 120 + 75y \]

We know this total is approximately 378.79 cents, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 120 + 75y = 378.79 \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ 75y = 378.79 - 120 \]
\[ 75y = 258.79 \]
\[ y = \frac{258.79}{75} \approx 3.45 \]

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he must have bought 3 candy bars. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

Elizabeth's total beads:
1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear = 1 + 2 = 3 packs
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red = 3 + 4 = 7 packs
7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Therefore, one sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking = 3
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, we get:

48 (from the dozen) + 2 (additional) = 50 eggs

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.
The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case.
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) for $25 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 5: Calculate the profit.
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

The salesman's profit is 539 dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn and soda at regular price
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + (popcorn + soda)

3. **Given Information:**
   - Soda costs $3
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket
   - Therefore, the total cost with the regular ticket option is $2 less than the super ticket option.

4. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Total cost with super ticket: $21
   - Total cost with regular ticket: $12 + (popcorn + $3)
   - Since you saved $2, the regular ticket cost is $2 less than the super ticket cost:
     \[
     21 - 2 = 12 + (popcorn + 3)
     \]
     Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     19 = 12 + popcorn + 3
     \]
     \[
     19 = 15 + popcorn
     \]
     \[
     popcorn = 19 - 15
     \]
     \[
     popcorn = 4
     \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

First, we find the cost of filling one balloon on the first day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The price increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

The value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies:
$4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:
$6400

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies, join the fairies that were already there. So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Final numerical answer:
45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (last place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 102\). Again, since there are only 100 positions, we adjust this to 100.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(100 - 3 = 97\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(97 + 1 = 98\).

So, Finley finished in 98th place."

"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's final cost from Kelly's final cost:

"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he initially has 200 / 2 = 100 pairs.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 100 + 5 = 105 pairs.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 more pairs, making it 105 + 15 = 120 pairs.

On Friday, he gains another 30 pairs, so he has 120 + 30 = 150 pairs.

By Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Since he has 150 pairs, he can only get rid of 150 pairs, not 180, as he doesn't have enough shoes to remove 180. So, he will get rid of all 150 pairs, leaving him with 0 pairs.

Therefore, on Sunday, he will have 0 pairs of shoes, which is 0 shoes.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint together:
\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earnings by 3 pm: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total earnings from the goal to find out how much more they need:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on his player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of Jillian's shoes, which is $80.
2. Calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes: \(3 \times 80 = 240\).
3. Subtract $20 from the result to find the cost of her handbag: \(240 - 20 = 220\).

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse eats \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total pounds of oats by the pounds per bag: \(200 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we find out how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we first need to add the highest temperatures together and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Adding these together:
-48 + 21 - 3 = -30°F

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 4 * 2 = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, after all discounts, is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the pyramid. The pyramid has 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and the shortest cheerleader (60 inches tall) at the top.

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. We can assume the 10th cheerleader is the shortest one, so she will be at the top of the pyramid.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each level:

- Bottom level (4 cheerleaders): 4 * 64 inches
- Middle level (3 cheerleaders): 3 * 64 inches
- Top level (2 cheerleaders): 2 * 64 inches
- Top (shortest cheerleader): 60 inches

Now, let's calculate the total height in inches:

\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 60 = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old in four years.
4. If Angela will be 42 in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela's current age is 38."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \(D\), the number of insects Bodhi found as \(B\), and the number of insects Lily found as \(L\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with expressions in terms of \(D\):
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[4D = 36\]

Divide by 4:
\[D = 9\]

Now, we can find \(L\) using the second equation:
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Cherrie has 5 friends in total.
2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each. So, for these 2 friends, the total number of gifts is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, for these 3 friends, the total number of gifts is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
4. Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Gifts for the 2 friends: 10

- Additional random gifts: 10

Total number of gifts = \(10 + 6 + 10 = 26\).

Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet wide} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1 (since $2 / 2 = $1).
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \$144.00 \]"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost for her bus trips would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the farm's animal count.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, which means the farm has 10 sheep (since 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep).

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

Adding the animals from both the farm and the zoo:

40 (farm's animals) + 20 (zoo's sheep) = 60 animals.

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 60 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market."
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.**  
   Since 1 pound of fat is equivalent to approximately 3500 calories, for 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn:  
   \( 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \)

2. **Calculate the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.**  
   Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.  
   - From December 31st to July 19th, we have:  
     - 31 days in December (from December 31st to December 31st)  
     - 31 days in January  
     - 28 days in February (assuming it's not a leap year)  
     - 31 days in March  
     - 30 days in April  
     - 31 days in May  
     - 19 days in June (from June 1st to June 19th)  
   Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 19 = 191 days

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed.**  
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:  
   \( \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{191 \text{ days}} \approx 549.47 \text{ calories/day} \)

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 549.47 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money.
4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find the final amount left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100
   \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400
   \]

3. Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100
   \]

4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find the final amount left.
   \[
   \text{Final amount left} = 400 - 100 = 300
   \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
- Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
- Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
- Tara sold each bag for $8.
- Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
- So, the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is $160."

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving half to his sister, Ali has:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the amount required for one grandchild and then multiply by three since she is making the same items for all three grandchildren.

For one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since she is making these for 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total by 3:
19 skeins/grandchild × 3 grandchildren = 57 skeins

Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of problems Chris completes each day and how many are left.

1. Chris starts with 100 problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
4. After Monday and Tuesday, the number of problems left is \(100 - 12 - 36 = 52\).
5. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\) problems.
6. After Wednesday, the number of problems left is \(52 - 13 = 39\).

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tony's Picking Rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's Picking Rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart than Tony.
   - Therefore, Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's Picking Rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   - Therefore, Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's Picking Rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Therefore, Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts per hour
- Bobby: 5 quarts per hour
- Kathy: 10 quarts per hour
- Ricky: 8 quarts per hour

Total = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
4. Add the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Unsold loaves returned: 6

Now, let's calculate the remaining loaves:

200 (total baked) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) + 6 (returned) = 74

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$504."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take that person 10 days. 

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the same house. Since the work is divided among 5 people, the time required would be reduced by a factor of 5.

So, the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house would be:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours required for 5 people to paint a whole house would be:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

- Ophelia's sofas: 20
- Ophelia's chairs: 22
- Jenna's sofas: 64
- Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\)

Total number of chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\)

Total number of sofas and chairs: \(84 + 88 = 172\)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that one CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

This means he would have $4 left. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy with the remaining $4 is:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
1"
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he worked out for 5 hours each for 2 consecutive weeks. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Additionally, he worked out for 6 hours in one week. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

Now, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin is currently. Since this will happen in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55 to find the cousin's current age:

Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

Finally, to find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:

Total cost = Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor
$2,400 = $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Simplifying the equation:

$2,400 = $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:

$2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
$600 = 2 * Cost of one monitor

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of the total bill.
3. The tip amount is 20% of $50, which is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\).
4. Therefore, the total amount to be paid, including the tip, is $50 (the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $60.
5. Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total amount.
6. Each person's share is $60 / 2 = $30.

So, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount he has now is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half (15 days) and the second half (15 days) are equal.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

For the second half of the month, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily as in the first half, so the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). Therefore, the total savings for the second half of the month would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month of April would be the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half, which is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he saves twice as much, which is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave the seller $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.

So, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.

So, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
- Difference = Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"To calculate the total cost Daniel has to spend, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy without the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
2. Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
3. Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

Now, to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, we first calculate twice the time it takes him in cold water:

\[ 2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to this time:

\[ 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, on a hot day, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we first calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

On a cold day:
\[ 3 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a hot day:
\[ 3 \times 34 \text{ minutes} = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost of your lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub first, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of your lunch:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost of your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that, so:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so:

\[ \text{Juan's daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction needed is:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters

The pet shop also has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

To find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The pet shop has a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the pyramid and how this affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. The initial angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun upward in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground, and moves 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{82} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs a candle for each year of their age, James needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old son and 8 candles for the 8-year-old son. Therefore, the total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is 4 * $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of pages she can read in 1 minute by the total number of minutes she read:
\[ \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, we are given that she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week to the pages from the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Together, they ate:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

5 sandwiches are left."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

The relationship given in the problem can be expressed as:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can find the number of goals Anna scored:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Liam made $63.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we calculate his earnings as follows:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Now, to find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. Calculate how much Peter spends each day from Sunday to Wednesday.
2. Determine how much money he has left after Wednesday.
3. Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money from Thursday to Saturday.
4. Sum the total number of action figures he buys.

First, let's find out how much Peter spends each day from Sunday to Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day. From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

This means he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

left after Wednesday. Now, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. With $30, he can buy:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday. 

From Sunday to Wednesday, he bought:

\[ 4 \times \frac{10}{5} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

wooden action figures. 

So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 23."
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up the costs of the spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum up the total number of birds:
50 (Day 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4 and 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 300 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is $1.00. However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since the problem does not specify that a pair is different from a single contact, we assume a pair is two contacts. Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Final numerical answer:
$40"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

100 ml / 200 calories = x ml / 1600 calories

Solving for x:
x = (100 ml * 1600 calories) / 200 calories
x = 160000 ml * calories / 200 calories
x = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speeds at each of the three points in time.

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we add these three speeds together and divide by 3 to find the average.

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 52 \]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:
- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the cost of the shipping on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in the total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein. So, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \(3 \times 2 = 6\) grams of protein.

Step 2: If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he consumes 6 grams of protein each day. To find out how much protein he consumes in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week).

So, \(6 \times 7 = 42\) grams of protein per week.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, the cost is:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there is an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, we add up all the cents Colby has:
\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

Therefore, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets 15 games in total.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total number of games = 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Howard spends each day and then subtract the total from his original amount of $100.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, his total earnings were \(7.50 \times 4 = 30\) dollars.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
- Over two hours, his total earnings were \(6.00 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

Patrick earned a total of 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know that 1 pump gives 60 washings, and each washing costs 20 cents. Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{20 \text{ cents}}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. 

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the items is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a typo and he can only buy one item, we'll calculate the cost of the shirt first, as it is cheaper.

The cost of the shirt after discount is $17.50. If Joe buys only the shirt, the amount left from his $50 would be:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32.50 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

   - Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month's cost.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - The cost for the 8th month is \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\).
   - The cost for the 9th month is \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\).
   - The cost for the 10th month is \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\).

Now, we sum up the costs for the remaining 5 months:
\[150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125\]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months:
\[100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 20 + 16 = 36 ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 36 ounces."

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat from the bull.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."

Let's start with step 1:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is \(4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}\).

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so the number of seats occupied by the administrators is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}\).

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats is \(72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}\).

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so the number of seats occupied by the parents is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}\).

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have taken their seats, which is \(54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}\).

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to determine the total number of street lights at all intersections and then subtract the number of non-functioning street lights.

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection:
   - Each pole has 4 street lights.
   - There are 6 poles at each intersection.
   - Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections:
   - There are 4 intersections.
   - Therefore, the total number of street lights is \(24 \times 4 = 96\).

3. Calculate the number of functioning street lights:
   - There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
   - Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is \(96 - 20 = 76\).

"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

For the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 356 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

For the second DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 135 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times = 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour.

First, let's find the total number of hours:

- John went to physical therapy twice a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours per week is:
2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session = 4 hours/week

Now, for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:
4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost:
The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is:
24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."
"Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. To find out how old she is now, we subtract 12 years from 16 years:

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:

4 + 4 = 8

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we first need to calculate the total amount each coach spent.

For the baseball coach:

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. 

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:
\[ 200 \text{ flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total for these three days is:
   \[10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}\]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
   \[10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day}\]
   For the four days, the total is:
   \[6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}\]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed in the week:
   \[30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}\]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \text{James made} = 17,500 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \text{ men} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
4800
\]"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
- Snowflake stamps: 16
- Truck stamps: 19
- Rose stamps: 10

Total number of stamps = \(16 + 19 + 10 = 45\).

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes.

The total cost for 10 classes is $60. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can attend all 10 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is:
\[ 10 - 0 = 10 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 10 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes in a week and then sum these numbers.

First, let's find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers a day.

Next, we calculate the number of customers each processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers a week.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers a week.

Now, we add the weekly totals to find the combined weekly production:
\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so he digs 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount for 20 pomegranates was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, to find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract Clara's final payment from Sheila's:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Calculate the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100.

**Final numerical answer:**
$2100"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of each hour:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 during the week. This means she received an additional $220 in the week. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the additional money in her account.

To find the amount withheld, we subtract the additional money in her account from her expected weekly wage:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (additional money) = $80

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

Step 2: Determine the number of whole eggs required.
- 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
- Number of whole eggs needed = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

Step 3: Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
- Number of dozens needed = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

Final numerical answer:
2 dozens"
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

She has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days

Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline, as the assignment is due in 30 days."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly cost for the hanger is $5,000.
3. The monthly cost for fuel is twice the hanger cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
\[ \text{Total yearly cost for hanger and fuel} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost for hanger and fuel gives us the total cost for the first year:
\[ \text{Total cost for the first year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice**: It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Cooking Time for Beans**: The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total Cooking Time**: To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20, so:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70, so:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds. Therefore, the cost of the coffee for a week is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut together, we get:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \( \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:

\( \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

"First, we need to determine the number of math teachers on the basketball court. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, so the remaining 40% are math teachers.

To find the number of math teachers, we calculate 40% of 150:
\[ 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers on the basketball court.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together by adding their individual amounts:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{3} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they share the money equally, each would have $120."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, we calculate the number of employees who are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."

   - Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
   - Each candy of type B costs $0.75.
   - Total cost for type B candies = 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

3. Calculate the total cost of all candies:
   - Total cost = Cost of type A candies + Cost of type B candies
   - Total cost = $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

4. Calculate the change Adam received:
   - Adam paid $15.
   - Total cost of candies = $11.
   - Change = $15 - $11 = $4.

Therefore, Adam got $4 in change."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. 

First, let's calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
- Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Now, let's account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to her record.

So, the total number of good days now is:
- Original good days = 12
- Additional good days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 12 more toys, so he now has 4 + 12 = 16 toys for 12 dogs.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 16 = 8 more toys.
6. After buying these toys, he has 16 + 8 = 24 toys for 24 dogs.
7. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
8. Since he no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, he still has 24 toys but only needs them for 21 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 24."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total initial investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[

"To reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her earnings for 6 hours are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

1. The weight of one adult is 80 kg.
2. The total weight of 8 adults is \(80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg}\).
3. Adding Jack's weight to the total, we get \(640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg}\).

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. 

To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

\(720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg}\).

They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves of the lawn:

- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much time they have left, we need to subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 6 minutes (to the corner) - 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals 2 * $2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which totals 2 * $3 = $6

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they have \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the 3 hours he has before dinner.

First, let's convert the 3 hours into minutes:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add up the time John spends on his homework:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes (math)} + 40 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 20 \text{ minutes (history)} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Each candy costs $0.80. Now, let's calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Next, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies together:

\[ 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves in a month and then in a year. Rong saves 20 coins every month. 

In a year, Rong saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In a year, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many coins they have saved in ten years. 

For Rong:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

For Neil:
\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the savings of Rong and Neil together:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, ten years after they started their savings, Rong and Neil have a total of 5760 coins."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.60x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.40x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14

Therefore, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate 50% of 50:
\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 8 point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[ 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[ 65 - 30 = 35 \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[ 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[ 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:
\[ 400 - 255 = 145 \]

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will see 40% of these fireworks:

- Hannah's view = 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 fireworks (city) + 15 fireworks (her own) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - There are 6 females.
   - There are 8 males, including Larry.

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings.

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males
   - Total dumplings = 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings.

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, we subtract that amount from his initial share to find out how much he has left.

$60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( v \) feet per second. According to the information given, the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed, so we can write the equation:

\[ 15 = 5v \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet per second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance \( d \) traveled is given by the formula:

\[ d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ d = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: The non-industrial usage is the total city usage minus the industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to get the total production in 48 hours:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4/2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each of them has left after two weeks:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

So, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is:
\[ \text{Fine} + \text{Cost of asphalt} = \$120 + \$75 = \$195 \]

Now, we calculate the savings:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Cost to city} - \text{Cost for Ron} = \$450 - \$195 = \$255 \]

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the remaining normal chairs:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Remaining normal chairs: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the remaining baby chairs:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Remaining baby chairs: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- Total chairs left: 150 (normal) + 10 (baby) = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since there are 5 people and each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is 5.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since each of them has 1 pizza, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since each of them has 1 pizza, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all the friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 18 \]"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog eats the same nine sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time the dog takes is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the given relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths.
3. Solve the equation for the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional 4 inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.

Number of students' cars' windows smashed:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Number of teachers' cars' windows smashed:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and then calculate the number of blue spools.

1. Calculate the total number of spools:
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45
   - Light green: 40
   - Dark green: 50
   Total = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45
   Total blue = 15 + 45 = 60

3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

The final numerical answer is 40%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 5000 people in line to vote.

2. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by midday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people remaining in line by midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people remaining in line by 16:00 is:
   \[
   3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he will need for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we need to determine how many packs of gum he will need. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults want 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since 24 smores are needed and 24 smores can be made from one box, they will need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate her father's age as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate her mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 34 \]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each of them got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weight of each book together.

1. Cindy has 2 math books, each weighing 2 pounds. So, the total weight for the math books is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
2. She has 1 science book weighing 2 pounds. So, the total weight for the science book is \(2\) pounds.
3. Her French book weighs 4 pounds.
4. Her English book weighs 3 pounds.
5. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[4 \text{ (math books)} + 2 \text{ (science book)} + 4 \text{ (French book)} + 3 \text{ (English book)} + 6 \text{ (history book)} = 19 \text{ pounds}\]

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 19 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes for candidate A as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 20 \]

Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate the votes for candidate B as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris."
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
\[32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}\]

So, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money spent:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

Step 1: Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same amount of students, we divide 80 by 2.
\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Step 2: In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40.
\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Step 3: To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.
\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so she can trade the remaining 34 large stickers for 34 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 34 large buttons and 100 + 34 = 134 large buttons in total.

5. **Total Buttons:**

"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which means he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, let's add up all the matches Joey played throughout the week:

- Matches on Monday: 2
- Matches on Friday: 1
- Matches on Saturday: 4

Total matches played in one week = \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\)

Joey played 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

Therefore, Krissa ordered 75 shirts."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 bag, we first calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

You will pay $133 after the discount."

The 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 is one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
3. We are also told that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of Jana's total puppies, then the total number of puppies is \(\frac{18}{2/3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27\).

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, the total amount Jayden has now is:

$70 (initial amount) + $45 (from Ava) = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 (cost of the camera) - $115 (amount Jayden has) = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = 71.42857142857143 \]

Since the third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 71.42857142857143 = 142.85714285714286 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a case of shingles), the third house will need 143 cases of shingles.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many pears George has, we start by calculating 45% of the number of bananas he has. Since George has 200 bananas, we calculate 45% of 200:

\[ 45\% \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

This means George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears together:

\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on a ball. So, the remaining amount of money she had is:

$80 - $20 = $60

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, for 20 kilograms, the cost would be 20 times $3.

20 * $3 = $60

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Now, to find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed:

450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's total) = 600 books

They have read a total of 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type sold and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = Vanilla scents sold - Fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135, we subtract the money he has already made from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell to make the remaining $75. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \text{ dollars per ear of corn} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time for soccer and video games is:

Remaining time = Total time - Reading time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Video game time = 1/3 * Remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time she spends playing soccer is the remaining time after accounting for reading and video games:

Soccer time = Remaining time - Video game time = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Soccer time / Total time) * 100

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time back from the museum:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles, and the speed is the same, 75 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. **Total time gone:**
   - Total time = Time to the museum + Time at the museum + Time back from the museum
   - Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately, and then add them together.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels that will be left is 276."

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mike has a total of 600 movies.
2. A third of these movies are in series, so the number of series movies is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies.
3. The cost for series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies.
6. The cost for older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

9. The total cost to replace the movies is the sum of the costs for series movies, older movies, and normal movies:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace Mike's movie collection with digital versions is $4400."
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches**: 
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00\)

2. **Plums**: 
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \(8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00\)

3. **Apricots**: 
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00\)

\text{Total cost} = \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, Winston spent \(\$38.00\) on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by both driving and hiking. We know the time spent on each activity and their respective speeds.

1. **Driving:**
   - Time spent driving: 4.5 hours (since the total time is 6 hours and they spent 1.5 hours hiking)
   - Speed while driving: 50 miles per hour

   Distance covered while driving = Time × Speed
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \, \text{hours} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} = 225 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Hiking:**
   - Time spent hiking: 1.5 hours
   - Speed while hiking: Half the driving speed minus 5 miles per hour
   \[
   \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour}
   \]

   Distance covered while hiking = Time × Speed
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 20 \, \text{miles/hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles}

The total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \ be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding them to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish in the pond is \( 3 + O \), and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

- Price of gas: $3 per gallon
- Total cost: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on gas for his commute to work."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

Therefore, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants."
"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, which is:

\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the school will contribute $150. This means John needs to raise the other half, which is also $150. John currently has $50, so the amount he still needs to raise is:

\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing $100."
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, and the day temperature was 45 degrees, then the night temperature would be:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be raised is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of groups that brought seashells} = 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
3. Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"To calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bottle caps Damien finds in a day.
2. Calculate the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.

Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Damien makes \(\$75.00\) in a 30-day month."
"Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For the additional hours worked beyond her regular 8-hour day, she is paid at a rate of 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, calculate the special hourly rate for the additional hours:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \text{ per hour} \]

On Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. The first 8 hours are paid at her regular rate, and the remaining 3 hours are paid at the special rate.

Calculate the pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Add the two amounts to find the total pay for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\$250\) for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. 

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike will pay $30 for the jeans. 

Now, if Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the cost of the jeans from the $50 bill to find out how much money he will have left over:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Billy's starting hourly rate: $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, his hourly rate increased by $0.50, so his new rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, his hourly rate increased by $1.00, so his final rate is $11.50 per hour.
   - If Billy works 20 hours, his earnings are: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her starting rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - If Sally works 20 hours, her earnings are: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount, so:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, let's break down the problem into parts.

1. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
   - Half an hour each day for 14 days is \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.

2. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:

   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

3. Add the tea consumed by all students to the remaining tea:
   - Total tea consumed: \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.
   - Remaining tea: 10 quarts.
   - Initial amount of tea: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

4. Convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons (1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(48 \div 4 = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after his second order and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after the second order: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200 candies
2. Candies sold: 150

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

Let's denote the number of students at the beginning of the year as \( S_0 = 10 \).

At the end of each month, the number of students doubles. So, the number of students at the end of each month can be calculated as follows:

- End of January: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_0 = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
- End of February: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_1 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
- End of March: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
- End of April: \( S_4 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 80 = 160 \)
- End of May: \( S_5 = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 160 = 320 \)

Now, to find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[ \text{Additional students} = S_5 - S_0 = 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows for the S'mores.

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:
\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows left} \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \text{ marshmallows per person} \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long is \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters each of these two friends uses is \( \frac{120}{10} = 12 \) quarters.
   - The total game time for the better friend is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters the better friend uses is \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

3. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - Each of the two friends who play half as long uses 12 quarters, so together they use \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) quarters.
   - The better friend uses 8 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 \) quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 44 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

We are given that the total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it further:

\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

Since \( z = s \), we can substitute \( z \) with \( s \) in the equation:

\[ s + 2s = 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3s = 5 \]

Solving for \( s \):

\[ s = \frac{5}{3} \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces.

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. He initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16, so the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days: \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes: \( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
\[ \text{Smendrick's cards} = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Weekly writing time = 2 hours = 120 minutes.
   - Monthly writing time = 120 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

- Total monthly time = Recording time + Writing time + Makeup time
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - She needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - She needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost of Additional Items**:
   - Each additional item costs $15.00.
   - For 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - For 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)

5. **Total Cost**:
   - Base installation cost: $129.00
   - Additional items cost: $195.00
   - Total cost: \(129 + 195 = 324\)

The total cost for Angela will be **$324.00**."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Use Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert inches to feet**: Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
   \[
   \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, then the speed of the kangaroos can be represented as the distance divided by the time. Let's denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). The total speed of the three kangaroos combined is \(3S\).

The time taken by the three kangaroos is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ 18 = \frac{D}{3S} \]
\[ D = 54S \]

This means the distance \(D\) is 54 times the speed of one kangaroo.

Now, let's consider the four turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{S}{2} = 2S \]

To find the time it takes for the four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\), we use the formula for time again:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54S}{2S} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 27 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total number of dishes = \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\)

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she has in her purse.

Step 1: The reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Step 2: The total amount of money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse, is the sum of the money she has been paid for her part-time job and the money her mom gave her:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Step 3: Since Erika still needs $50 to buy the laptop, the amount of money she has in her purse is the difference between the reduced price of the laptop and the total amount of money she has (excluding her purse):
\[ 400 - 230 - 50 = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the unused portion of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused portion of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused portion of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add the unused portions of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$40 - $21 = $19

Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding both totals together:
- Total number of socks and dishes: \( 90 + 90 = 180 \)

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are not good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
20 (total students) - 13 (neither math only nor English only) = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes to perform and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:
2 * 60 = 120 minutes

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for the groups to perform is:
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:
110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11

11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form
- Time (T) = 3 years

Now, let's calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining white shirts have no collars. So, \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts have no collars.

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts have no buttons. So, \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts have no buttons.

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. So, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons.
- \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30
Number of trays = 30

Now, if he sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Total earnings = Number of trays × Price per tray
Total earnings = 30 × $2.5
Total earnings = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food, taking into account the $2 discount for each basket.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate one-half of the rooms.
\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms.
\[ \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ homes} \]

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes} \]

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year, which is:
\[ 48 \times 2 = 96 \text{ homes} \]

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \text{ homes} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( F \) be the age of Fatima (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Fatima is three years younger than her brother: \( F = B - 3 \).
2. Fatima is two years older than her sister: \( F = S + 2 \) or \( S = F - 2 \).
3. The mother's age is one less than three times the brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( F + B + S + M = 87 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( F \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation, we get:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Adding 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find Fatima's age:
\[ F = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, Fatima is 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine the number of packs required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initial infected people: 10

**Day 1:**

- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

After three days, the total number of people infected is 3430."
"Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ 1520 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
2 oranges/daughter × 3 daughters = 6 oranges

She also gave 3 oranges to her only son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
12 oranges (initially bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:

\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:

\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. 

In one hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. Therefore, in 5 hours, she bakes:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices she has is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$40.00 \]"
"Gretchen has 70 gold coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. 

To find the number of silver coins, we subtract 30 from the number of gold coins:
70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 520 burritos.
- Leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. **Blue Cars**: There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

So, the number of yellow cars is:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). Therefore, in \( x \) years, her age will be:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes."

"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."

55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the number of cookies by the number of jars:

50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies per jar.

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob, and then use that to find the speed of the whirligig.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.

First, we find the speed of the thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ m/s}}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ m/s} = 55 \text{ m/s} \]

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
- The cost of the salad is $6.
- The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day, and the total cost is $11.

So, the equation for the total cost per day is:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Mark's new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Therefore, his weekly earnings are 40 hours * $12/hour = $480.

Mark makes $480 a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
3. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
4. We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each time he hired her. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \).
5. The total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is \( 6 \times 3J + 6 \times 5J = 18J + 30J = 48J \).
6. The total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   6J + 48J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   54J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
7. To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to determine the value of \( J \). Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54J \), we can isolate the lemonade sales:
   \[
   \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80 - 54J
   \]
8. To find \( J \), we need to consider that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6. Since \( 54J \) is a multiple of 6, we can test values of \( J \) that make \( 54J \) a feasible part of the total earnings.

Let's test \( J = 1 \):
   \[
   54 \times 1 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80 - 54 = 26
   \]
This value of \( J \) works because it results in a feasible total earnings.

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the steps given in the problem:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is \(55 + 16 = 71\) kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is \(71 + 8 = 79\) kg.
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is \(79 - 5 = 74\) kg.

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out each month.
2. Calculate his total earnings from renting the car.
3. Subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented out each month
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Total earnings
He gets paid $25 an hour.
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Step 3: Calculate profit
Subtract the car payment from his total earnings.
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

110 miles"
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies to be divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left. Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup equally between them.

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost of the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets.
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa has seen each one 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Step 2: Calculate the average price per ticket.
- Deepa has spent $216 in total.
- The total number of tickets is 27.
- The average price per ticket is \(\frac{216}{27}\).

Now, let's perform the division:

\[
\frac{216}{27} = 8
\]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of 9 is:
9 * (1/3) = 3 red shoe boxes.

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 
1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6 marbles.

So, after giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles left.

Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.
So, after giving 10 marbles to Donald, Dean has:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles left.

Therefore, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation: \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \).

Now, substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Together, the two farms have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

700 acres"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku:**
   - A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so:
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( y \).

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total bologna pieces for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ y = \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours from each day:

5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours in these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost for 12 balloons as follows:
   - Cost for 2 balloons = $0.5
   - Cost for 1 dozen (12 balloons) = $0.5 * (12 / 2) = $0.5 * 6 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each = $7 * 2 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can find out how much each one received by dividing the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Total revenue
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Total cost
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

"To find out how many pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."

"Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea. However, since we can't have half a cup in practical terms, we should consider the problem in the context of whole numbers. Given the problem's setup, we can assume that the division is meant to be even in a practical sense, so each row has 4.5 cups of each type of tea, which in a real-world scenario would likely be rounded or adjusted, but for the purpose of this problem, we'll use the given numbers.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ 4.5 \]

Final numerical answer:
4.5"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, we find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in 2 trips:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
   \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip.

"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water.

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water remains.

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

2000"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - **Movies**: 5 (Fridays or Saturdays) + 8 (other days) = 13 movies
     - Cost per movie on Fridays or Saturdays: $10
     - Cost per movie on other days: $7
     - Total cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of that, which is \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.

Step 2: Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of that, which is \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Step 4: Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

Step 5: Adding the total calories from both types of pastries, we get \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday through Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is 50 years.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 (for herself) = 9 balloons.
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons.

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so the total number of tables needed to fit all the boxes is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these two totals.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants:
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine produces in a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets:

- Price per widget: $6

3. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

4. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ \text{Cost for 24-hour stay} = 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours (17 - 12) cost 70 pesos per hour.

So, the cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding this to the initial 12-hour cost:
\[ \text{Total cost for 17 hours} = 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
\[ \text{Savings} = 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Subtracting 3 pounds from 10 pounds gives us 7 pounds for each sheep.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds, so the total for the goats is:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds, so the total for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to the next whole hour because the charge is per hour or part thereof. So, 2.25 hours is rounded up to 3 hours. Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

- Visit Charge: $40
- Labor Charge: $105
- Parts Charge: $60

Total Charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, we need to account for the 5 CDs that James doesn't like and sells for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, we subtract the money he got from selling the 5 CDs from the total amount he spent:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110, not that he was out any money. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110.

Final numerical answer:
$110"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 each = $9
2. For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 each = $20
3. For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 each = $5

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is 10% of $5, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \]

So, the total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is:
\[ 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \]

So, the total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- Add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The total commission is:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00."
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. B + A + D = 45 (since the total points scored by the team is 45)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second and third equations to express A and D in terms of B:
- A = B - 20
- D = B - 10

Substituting these into the first equation, we get:
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we have:
3B - 30 = 45

Adding 30 to both sides:
3B = 75

Dividing both sides by 3:
B = 25

Now, we can find A by substituting B back into the equation A = B - 20:
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the information given about the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

To find the total number of pages, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before sleepwalking:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Total sleep time = Usual sleep time - Time awake before sleepwalking - Time sleepwalking
   - Total sleep time = \(480 - 55 - 23 = 402\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 402 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ (cups)} + 10 \text{ (spoons)} = 34
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert by finding the original number before the 20% increase.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to the information given, Courtney reported 48 people, which is 120% of the actual number (100% + 20% overstatement).

So, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Let's say Jeffrey carried \( J \) balls. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are told that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball, and Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) balls. This means that \( J = 1 \).

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls equation:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
225"
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
2. Add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The supplies cost $400, and the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. So, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost:

\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is $1000."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance south} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting for her.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made: 12
- Brownies received from office: 6
- Brownies received from surprise party: 48

Total brownies before the surprise party: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Now, subtract the brownies eaten during the surprise party:

- Brownies eaten: 18

Brownies left over: 66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes = 1/4 of the total boxes

To find the total number of boxes, we can set up the equation:
8 boxes = 1/4 * total boxes

Solving for the total number of boxes:
total boxes = 8 boxes * 4 = 32 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:
32 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 640 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 640 oranges = 160 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges she kept:
640 oranges - 160 oranges = 480 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 480 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means that Jerry must have \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both days.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday for each type of baked good.

For gingerbread on Sunday:
\[ \text{Gingerbread on Sunday} = \text{Gingerbread on Saturday} + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ boxes} \]

For apple pie on Sunday:
\[ \text{Apple pie on Sunday} = 15 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total Gingerbread:**
\[ \text{Total Gingerbread} = \text{Gingerbread on Saturday} + \text{Gingerbread on Sunday} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

**Total Apple Pie:**
\[ \text{Total Apple Pie} = \text{Apple pie on Saturday} + \text{Apple pie on Sunday} = (10 - 4) + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good.

**Earnings from Gingerbread:**
\[ \text{Earnings from Gingerbread} = \text{Total Gingerbread} \times \text{Price per box} = 25 \times 6 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Earnings from Apple Pie:**
\[ \text{Earnings from Apple Pie} = \text{Total Apple Pie} \times \text{Price per box} = 21 \times 15 = 315 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to get the total earnings for the two days.

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from Gingerbread} + \text{Earnings from Apple Pie} = 150 + 315 = 465 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $465 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- The vacation lasts for 8 days.

So, the total amount of sunscreen used is:
\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. If the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. First, find 40% of $100:
   \[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
   \[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days, we add the amounts from each day:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30 students:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this number by calculating 25% of 24:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet, we'll keep our calculations in feet.

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.

So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (for the space) = 2.5 feet

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up:
111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
44 - 17 = 27 more plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants for all 5 hanging baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00. So, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- Each basket will also have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. So, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- Since each basket costs $14, the total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

So, Katherine will spend a total of $70 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

70"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

Since $500.00 is half of $1,000.00, she can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes each month. However, since she cannot buy half a pair of shoes, we need to consider the total amount she can save in a year and then see how many whole pairs she can buy.

In a year, she saves:
$500.00 * 12 months = $6,000.00

Now, we divide the total amount saved in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Cooling effect: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
- Warming effect: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).

The net temperature change is:
\[18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\].

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14 degrees.**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \(D\).
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, which is \(3D\).
3. The time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years, so the difference in age between Bill and his dad when Bill saw the comet for the second time is 75 years.

Since Bill saw the comet a second time at age \(3D\) and his dad was \(D\) at the first sighting, the difference in their ages is \(3D - D = 2D\). This difference in age is also 75 years, so we can set up the equation:
\[2D = 75\]
\[D = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5\]

So, Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet the first time. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was \(3D = 3 \times 37.5 = 112.5\) years old, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

The time between the two sightings is 75 years, so Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is:
\[112.5 - 75 = 37.5\]

Therefore, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

37.5"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks for the electric bill per year.

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also totals \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month for the church. Over a year, this amounts to \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the first plane takes \(\boxed{11}\) flights to France in one day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Length of All Howls:**
   - Total howl duration = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
   - Total howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert Seconds to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his mother and father.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

The trousers cost $30, so the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the difference between the cost of the trousers and the money he received from his parents.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars from his savings.

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then donates $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from everyone else. So, the lawyer's donation will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first define the size of the slices. Let's say each kid's slice is represented by \( x \) units of the watermelon. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \) units.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) slices. The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices, which is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) units, and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \) units. Therefore, the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is \( \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \).

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. Convert the total time spent into hours:
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. Subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
   - 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
- 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. So, we can write the equation: \( 4P = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. So, we can write the equation: \( 7M = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( P \) and \( M \):

For Peter:
\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

For Martha:
\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.
\[ \text{Final number of porcupines} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. The amount she needs to save is:
\[ 20\% \times \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept two packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Anne has 10 friends and she gave the sweets equally, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the original price of $120 for each of the three years.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then figure out how many of those are selfies and portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally among 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8 to find out how many pictures are in each album:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits only. This means there are 3 albums with only selfies and 2 albums with only portraits. The remaining albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits = 3 albums) could contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but the problem does not specify this, so we assume the remaining albums are either selfies or portraits, but we only need to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Since 3 albums are selfies only, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

And since 2 albums are portraits only, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how long it takes James to read one page.
2. Calculate the total time spent reading 18 pages.

First, we know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages. We multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18:
\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests who checked out early: -24
- Guests who checked out late: -15
- Guests who checked in in the afternoon: +30
- Guests who checked in after dinner: +7

So, the calculation is:
100 - 24 - 15 + 30 + 7

Let's do the math:
100 - 24 = 76
76 - 15 = 61
61 + 30 = 91
91 + 7 = 98

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."

He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of average and difficult questions: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we have:
  - Number of average questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
  - Number of difficult questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions:
  - Number of easy questions Aries gets correct: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correctly:
  - Number of average questions Aries gets correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correctly:
  - Number of difficult questions Aries gets correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

Adding these up gives the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Total correct answers: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( L \):
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

So, Suzanne has \(\$300\) left from her earnings."
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \]

This means that out of the 100 eggs, 60 were found by the Smith twins. Therefore, the number of eggs left for their friends to find is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that 10 eggs were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the friends found:

\[ \boxed{30} \] eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Next, Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining $2000. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

This means she has 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, as she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her clutch of balloons. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's sum up the total number of balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 60% of 50%, which is \(0.5 \times 0.6 = 0.3\) or 30%.

3. **Normal Teacher with Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 80% of 60% of 50%, which is \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\) or 24%.

Now, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework:
\[0\% + 30\% + 24\% = 54\%\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is \(\boxed{54\%}\)."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests.
3. Divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for guests: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (allocated seats) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. We know that 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. Therefore, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium-sized jelly beans.
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. This means that 150 medium-sized jelly beans are equivalent to \(150 \times 3 = 450\) small jelly beans.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is 8 * 5 = 40 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds."
"Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, and each box contains forty apples. Therefore, the total number of apples he has is:

2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor buys and then subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the amount of money she has left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
10 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income with his college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / Annual income with college degree = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
3. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
- The painters worked for 3 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
- The painters worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.
- There are 24 hours in a day.
- Therefore, the number of hours worked per day by the team is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.
- Over 21 days, the total number of hours worked by the team is \(21 \times 9 = 189\) hours.

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours each painter worked.
- There are 4 painters.
- Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked is \(\frac{189}{4} = 47.25\) hours.

Final numerical answer:
Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

Let's calculate the value of the car for each year:

1. **2007**: The initial value is $20,000.
2. **2008**: The value after one year of depreciation is $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800.
3. **2009**: The value after another year of depreciation is $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,482.
4. **2010**: The value after another year of depreciation is $12,482 * 0.79 = $9,849.78.

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,849.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books.
2. Calculate the number of German books.
3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

Step 1: Calculate the number of English books.
Half of the 50 books are in English, so:
\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of German books.
10% of the 50 books are in German, so:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"Let's break down the costs:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet area and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
2. To cover 200 square feet, you will need \(200 \text{ SqFt} / 1 \text{ SqFt per tile} = 200\) tiles.
3. Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be **$2400**."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is the original cost plus the increase:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds in total each week.

Since he washes 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to do 2 loads for the twins and 1 load for the king, which totals 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they continue this pattern for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much cat food is consumed per feeding:
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food per feeding.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per feeding is:
- \( 60 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 180 \, \text{grams} \)

Imma feeds her cats twice a day, so the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
- \( 180 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 360 \, \text{grams} \)

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
- \( \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \)

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices eaten by each person:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

The total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 / 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. **Glee Club:**
   - Ordered 20 pizzas.
   - Ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. **Football Team:**
   - Ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
   - Ate 80% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. **Total Pizzas Eaten:**
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. **Total Pizzas Ordered:**
   - Total pizzas ordered = 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

5. **Pizzas Left:**
   - Pizzas left = Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten = 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

**Final Answer:**
14 pizzas are left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing both the small and big coupons.

First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon:
- Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons.
- He is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he sends out \(2 \times 700 = 1400\) big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon:
- The cost to mail one small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for 700 small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.
- The cost to mail one big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for 1400 big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost of mailing all the coupons:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons
- Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Meatballs in Initial Order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, in the initial order, there are \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. **Mark's Consumption:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

4. **Additional Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

5. **Meatballs in the Remaining Sub Sandwiches:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Final numerical answer:

"Mr Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day:
300 tons"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price. 

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. 

For the first pound, he pays $4.00. 
For the second pound, he pays half of $4.00, which is $2.00. 

So, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- He will need 3 sets of 2 pounds (since 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets).
- Each set of 2 pounds costs $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$18.00"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining three-quarters of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Maggie as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Next, we determine how much money Riza initially had. Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining two-thirds of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Riza as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, we calculate how much money each of them has left after spending.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

So, Maggie has:

\[
80 - 20 = 60
\]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

So, Riza has:

\[
90 - 30 = 60
\]

Finally, we add the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas are eaten by the first and second monkeys each day.
2. Then, we can calculate how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Since the total number of bananas bought is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), we can find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas are eaten by all three monkeys each day, we divide the total number of bananas by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we know that the first and second monkeys together eat 24 bananas each day. Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and she only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny needs 20 quarters to cover the additional $5. Therefore, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for 1/4 of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and then figure out how many more she needs to save.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Calculate the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs to save:
   - Total required = 200 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks:
   - Toothpicks needed = 80.
   - Toothpicks saved per week = 10.
   - Weeks needed = 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then express this difference as a percentage of the original price.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, 1 spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If 1 spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. In total, he walks 4 miles (2 miles to the halfway point and 2 miles back home).

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes for him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

The final numerical answer is:
1 hour"
"To determine how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying 40 individual bananas (since each bunch averages 4 bananas and she bought 10 bunches).

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 individual bananas:
- Each individual banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny needs 40 bananas.
- Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, we find the difference in cost between buying the bananas individually and in bunches:
- Cost for bunches = $30.00
- Cost for individual bananas = $32.00
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.50 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

Now, we calculate the earnings:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings:

Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour, and then determine the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
3. The net number of bales left in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Now, we calculate the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:

\[2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales}\]

So, after 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes each day is:
\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we need to find out what his total weekly minutes are:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes (weekdays)} \]

The extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time spent learning in a week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:
\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time John spends learning each week is:
\[ \boxed{28.33} \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

\(\frac{32}{3}\) feet"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right) \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives us the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy can help based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.
- Number of days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy can help.**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- Number of people Billy helps per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total number of people Billy helps = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**
Billy helps 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time for breaks and lunch per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby's total break and lunch time per day is 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the total time over 5 days:
- Total time over 5 days = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate how many miles Micah ran and then subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run.

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. The total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran:
\[52 - 8 - 28 = 16\]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts first. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

- Average height of heels: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike if she wants to finish on time.

First, we need to know the number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to cover each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she would cover in 30 days if she walks 250 miles each day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to cover 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and her planned distance is:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike to cover the additional 1800 miles, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each of the books cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna has spent in total.
2. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, we know Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchase. So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. Therefore, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each of the books cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

50 students + 10 students = 60 students

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, we calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, but to be sure, we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To calculate the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 140 miles (to parents) + 140 miles (back home) = 280 miles

3. **Determine the number of trips per month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.

4. **Calculate the total miles driven in a month:**
   - Total miles = Round trip distance × Number of trips
   - Total miles = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives a total of 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. So, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. So, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the first four workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, and Kris kept 9 for herself. So, Kris originally had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers.
2. These 16 stickers were the result of Luis giving half of what he received to Rob. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can find out how many small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \text{ mph} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of eggs painted by Arnold be \( A \).
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let the number of eggs painted by Camden be \( C \) and by Sarah be \( S \).
4. We know that \( C + S = 30 \) and \( C = S + 12 \).

From the second equation, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ C = S + 12 \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

The total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write this as:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles, given the information about her walking speeds and the time spent on the beach.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 / (2/3) = 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hours.
   - Convert this time to minutes: (1/6) * 60 minutes = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week. Over 8 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
The total amount she wants to save is $60. She has already saved $32, so she needs:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks needed to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, he had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. Since he originally has 36 marbles, if he loses 10, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The average temperature of the mixture can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add the initial numbers to the totals added:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer: 700**"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many 2-scoop portions are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) portions of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each 2-scoop portion requires 3 potatoes, for 9 portions, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

\[14x = 84\]

\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers were sold per day. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8, with each bouquet containing 12 sunflowers. Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day.

The number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day is:
\[ \frac{56}{8} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

The number of sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers per day is:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ 84 + 13 = 97 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers were sold in 3 days, we multiply the daily sales by 3:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Therefore, after 3 days, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, we calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and his revenue:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.

Given:
- The probability of winning the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

So, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day, so:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots from weekdays and weekends together:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20. He sells each for twice the original price, which means he sells each for $20 * 2 = $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price
Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so he bought a total of:
2 + 4 = 6 devices

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
Total profit = Profit per device * Number of devices
Total profit = $20 * 6 = $120

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8
2. **Number of octuplets dressed in purple**: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
3. **Number of octuplets dressed in blue**: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to determine how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows.

4. **Number of blue-wearers wearing bows**: \( 2 \times \frac{1}{1} = 2 \) (since all blue-wearers wear bows)
5. **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: \( 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \)

Now, we need to find the total number of octuplets wearing bows.

6. **Total number of octuplets wearing bows**: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

Finally, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

7. **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: 2
8. **Total number of octuplets wearing bows**: 4

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of octuplets wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

**Final numerical answer:**
50%"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, we add the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Abraham earns from selling his land in three separate transactions.

1. **First Sale:**
   - Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He sold this land for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he had \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sold a quarter of the remaining 40 square meters.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He sold this land for $30.

3. **Third Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he had \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from this sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, we add up all the money earned from the three sales:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by calculating half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:

2 changes/goat * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. A 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(x - 200\) fruits, where \(x = 1000\) (from the 10-year-old tree), so \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these up:

\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2450."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) using the first relationship:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**

3. **After giving money to their sister, the remaining amounts:**
   - Ronnie's remaining money: \(5 - x\)
   - Rissa's remaining money: \(15 - x\)

4. **According to the problem, after giving money to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money:**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + (20\% \times 100 \text{ pods}) = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per cycle}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   After paying, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has now is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.**

We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches. Let's denote the length of the chalk after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). The length of the chalk after each day can be described by the following recurrence relation:
\[ L_{n+1} = L_n - 0.20 \times L_n = 0.80 \times L_n \]

Starting with \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches, we can calculate the length of the chalk after each day until it is less than 2 inches.

- After 1 day: \( L_1 = 0.80 \times 2.75 = 2.20 \) inches
- After 2 days: \( L_2 = 0.80 \times 2.20 = 1.76 \) inches

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

Therefore, the number of days before the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped
   - Teeth fixed = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer: Colin is 20 years old."
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times \$18/\text{bag} = \$306 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's 6 friends will eat.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza, each pie is cut into 12 slices. To find out how many cheese pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pie:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} \]

For the pepperoni pizza, each pie is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pie:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together, we get the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total is:
3 miles/day × 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total is:
5 miles/day × 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days together:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay has after accounting for the melting is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs per hour.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net number of snowballs built per hour. So, \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer: 5 hours**"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( 2J \) be John's age at that time. Since John is 28 now, the number of years since Digimon came out is \( 28 - 2J \).

2. We know that John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - (28 - 2J) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 28 - 28 + 2J \]
\[ 2J = 2J \]

This equation is true for any \( J \), but we need to use the relationship between their ages at the time Digimon came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - (28 - 2J) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 28 - 28 + 2J \]
\[ 2J = 28 - 2J \]
\[ 4J = 28 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jim was 7 years old when Digimon came out. Since it has been \( 28 - 2 \times 7 = 14 \) years since then, Jim is now:
\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \]

Therefore, Jim is 21 years old now.

"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices each one ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[50 - 38 = 12\] bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[38 - 10 = 28\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[12 - 28 = -16\] bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages, so at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[50 - 28 = 22\] bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\] bandages. They used half a pack, which is:
   \[50 / 2 = 25\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had:
   \[22 + 100 - 25 = 97\] bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The discrepancy is:
\[97 - 78 = 19\] bandages.

This 19 bandages is the number of bandages they had at the end of the second day before ordering the two bulk packs on the third day. So, before ordering the two bulk packs, they had:
\[78 + 25 - 100 = 3\] bandages left at the end of the second day.

Therefore, at the start of the second day (end of the first day), they had:
\[3 + 28 = 31\] bandages.

And at the start of the first day, they had:
\[31 + 38 = 69\] bandages.

So, they started with 69 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so she had 2 inches of hair cut off.

The cost of the haircut is calculated as:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Adding the cost of the color to the cost of the haircut:
\[ \$40 + \$60 = \$100 \]

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. So, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he was paid for that task, and then sum up all the amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   - $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   - $3.00 * 1 = $3.00

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   - $1.50 * 1 = $1.50

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   - $0.75 * 2 = $1.50

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:

- $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) = $9.00

Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of blood in one shark.
2. Multiply that amount by ten to find the total for ten sharks.

Step 1: A whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:
\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:

- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Adding these together, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees.

"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining after each event:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person got 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Now, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 22."
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the first floor's ceiling height from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, we know the total number of dogs is 4, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Adding these weights together:

56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight of the tunas by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

2. For one dose, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
3. The amount of the second medicine is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.
4. Therefore, the total amount of medicine for one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.
5. To find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8.
6. So, 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final numerical answer is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Therefore, the total capacity of both schools combined is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
2. There are 2 children, so the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.
4. Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 and his wife changes 5, Jordan changes the remaining 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( R_{\text{est}} \) is:
\[ R_{\text{est}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]

3. At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station enter the bus. So, the number of people entering at the second station is:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]

4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]

5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3

So, the new cost of one visit is $2 (original cost) + $3 (increase) = $5.

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Therefore, the cost for one year of visits is:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 5 years, the total cost is:
5 years * $15/year = $75

For the next 3 years, the cost remains the same at $5 per visit. So, the cost for these 3 years is:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Adding the costs for the 5 years and the 3 years gives us the total amount Pauline spent:
$75 + $45 = $120

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $120 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ 225 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of wooden tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of 100 dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

- There are 5 windows.
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- So, the total width of the windows is \(5 \times 35 = 175\) inches.

Step 2: Multiply the total width by 2.
- Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.
- Therefore, the amount of fabric needed is \(175 \times 2 = 350\) inches.

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00

Therefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The problem also states that each of the five people in the class gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Since the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies, we have:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers (10 nails on each hand, so 20 nails in total).
3. Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted price for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted price for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers.
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails in total (10 on each hand).

Total cost for nail art: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

Step 3: Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.
- Total cost: \( 28 + 32 + 60 = 120 \)

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We know she has 3 magazines of the first type, 1 magazine of the second type, and 1 magazine of the third type, which totals:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \text{ magazines} \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December is $72. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase.

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we add up the capacity of all the shelves in one bookcase:
- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total capacity of one bookcase:
\[20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}\]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

2. There are 8 rooms in the house, and there is a flashlight for every room, so that's an additional 8 flashlights. In total, they have 4 (personal) + 8 (room) = 12 flashlights.
3. For the candles:
   - Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles = 16 small candles.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles = 20 medium candles.
   - In total, they have 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Adding the flashlights and candles together:
- Flashlights: 12
- Candles: 36

Final numerical answer:
12 flashlights + 36 candles = 48 candles and flashlights."
"Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. Therefore, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

His family has five members, and if they all get the same number of chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included in the total time as per the problem statement)

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70
\]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones in one day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in one day.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of workdays in a week.

Step 1: Convert the hours spent at work into minutes.
Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of calls he can handle in one day.
It takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call. Therefore, the number of calls he can handle in one day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls he handles in a 5-day work week.
\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with the new varnish - Total drying time with the old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering needs of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total plants: 20
   - Plants needing half a cup: 4
   - Plants needing 1 cup: 8
   - Plants needing a quarter of a cup: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Each plant needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

Now, we add up the total cups of water needed for all the plants:
- Total cups: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the phone plan:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:

"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

To find out how many days she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

1. Cost for blouses in one week: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
2. Cost for pants in one week: 2 pants * $8.00 per pair of pants = $16.00
3. Cost for skirts in one week: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for each breed and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
- 3 German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- 2 Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

Now, to find the weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

Final numerical answer:

"To find the number of red blocks in the tower, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

1. The tower has 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation as:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, we add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add the weight of both children together:

\[ 75 \, \text{pounds/child} \times 2 \, \text{children} = 150 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[ 1200 \, \text{pounds} + 250 \, \text{pounds} + 150 \, \text{pounds} = 1600 \, \text{pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the hot dogs. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so the revenue from cupcakes is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so the revenue from cookies is \(40 \times 1 = 40\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total revenue is \(40 + 40 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays:

- Frances buys five trays at $4 each, so the total cost is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

- The money left is \(80 - 20 = 60\) dollars.

Therefore, Frances has 60 dollars left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children following the truck.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children doubles.
   - 5 children + 5 more children = 10 children.
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - 10 children * (1 + 2) = 10 * 3 = 30 children.
4. **Children Leave**: The original 5 children leave the group.
   - 30 children - 5 children = 25 children.

So, the final number of children following the truck is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's do the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"James has 1 quarter, 2 nickels, and 7 dimes.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 2 nickels are worth 2 * 5 = 10 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 7 dimes are worth 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Adding these amounts together:

25 cents (from the quarter) + 10 cents (from the nickels) + 70 cents (from the dimes) = 105 cents.

"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes of meditation per day. Over 4 weeks, assuming she practices every day, she would meditate for:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 840 \text{ minutes} \]

For yoga, she practices 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. Over 4 weeks, she would practice yoga for:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on meditation and yoga gives:

\[ 840 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 2040 \text{ minutes} \]

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then sum these values.

1. Small t-shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet per shirt = 33 square feet
2. Medium t-shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet per shirt = 32 square feet
3. Large t-shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet per shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add these values together to get the total square footage of the quilt:

33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

The quilt is 101 square feet."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

To find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, we determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we calculate:

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Albert's height is given as 36 inches.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) inches.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is \(72 - 2 = 70\) inches.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before the summer, she was \(70 - 3 = 67\) inches tall.

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the produced bars.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 bars per day.

Step 2: There are 14 days in two weeks, so the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 3: The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue is:

Therefore, the company will receive \(\$140000\) for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
   - For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Shoes:**
   - The shoes are 40% off the original price.
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16.
   - Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Jake spends is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.
   - Total cost = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan and his friends spent on ice cream cones. Since each ice cream cone costs $1.25 and he bought 4 ice cream cones (one for himself and three friends), the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Since each movie ticket costs $6.50, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100, so the total for the bathrobes is $100 + $100 = $200.
So, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total to find out how much they spent in all:
- Ellen's total: $105
- Lani's total: $230

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).

The total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. So, we can write the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides:

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."

- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \), then Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \), to run 4 miles, she would take \( 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 32 when his son James was born, and James is currently 18, John is currently 32 + 18 = 50 years old.

The question asks for the age of John's youngest son in 3 years. Since the youngest son was born when John was 32, and we are not given any information about the youngest son's current age, we can assume the question is referring to James, as he is the only son mentioned in the context of John's age at birth.

So, in 3 years, James will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
