"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by 1.5 times the original value.

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:

\[ \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which includes the purchase price and the repair costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, the profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses are in each price category. Since every second glass is cheaper, out of 16 glasses, 8 will be the cheaper price and 8 will be the regular price.

Calculate the total cost for the 8 regular-priced glasses:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Calculate the total cost for the 8 cheaper-priced glasses:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston = \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \( 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \).

The final numerical answer is:
260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download the first 80 GB: 40 minutes.
   - Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes.
   - Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes.
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to calculate the distance John covers on his way back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is \(4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) hours, at a speed of 80 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance he covers on his way back home is:

\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries that Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the final total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual expenses:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

Next, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

Let \( n \) be the number of years. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
7.5n
\]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the total net profit is at least $90:
\[
7.5n \geq 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Speculated increase: 2.5%
   - Increase in value: \( 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \)
   - New value of jewelry: \( 5000 + 125 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Speculated increase: 1.2%
   - Increase in value: \( 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \)
   - New value of electronic gadgets: \( 8000 + 96 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the new values to determine the profit:

- Profit from jewelry: \( 5125 - 5000 = 125 \)
- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( 8096 - 8000 = 96 \)

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final Answer:**
The profit from the jewelry is $125."

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Since both trains follow the same route and travel the same distances, we can calculate the total distance for one train and then state the result for the other train.

**Total Distance for One Train:**
- Distance traveled westward: 80 miles
- Distance traveled northward: 150 miles

Adding these distances together:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230 \text{ miles}} \]"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

1. **Teaching Earnings:**
   - Hourly rate for teaching: $20
   - Hours worked per week: 35
   - Weeks worked per year: 50

   \[
   \text{Annual teaching earnings} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Annual teaching earnings} = 20 \times 35 \times 50 = 35000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Coaching Earnings:**
   - Hourly rate for coaching: $30
   - Hours worked per week: 15

"First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance and the total time required for the hike:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total time required = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   - Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Determine the remaining time needed to complete the hike:**
   - Remaining time = Total time required - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

**Final Answer:**
6 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total age of Darrell and Allen.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts. Let's denote Darrell's age by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To calculate the total hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. John has 10 dogs, so the daily care time for all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 1 point more than in the first 20 minutes, which is:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Mike, we add the points from both halves of the game:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is 9."
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $5 left, the calculation is correct. Now, we need to determine how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets initially and none were left after the transaction, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone:**
   - Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   - Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   - Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   - Since Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the throwing distance of the gold javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, her throwing distance is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from Polly's throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories remaining.

Next, we need to find out how many calories each serving of chips contains:
250 calories per serving.

Now, we calculate how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can find out how many grams are in one serving:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Finally, we calculate how many grams of chips can be eaten with 0.8 servings:
0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

\[
\text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies. The cost for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the total cost is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
\]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
\]

Finally, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Net profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
\]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchases and usage.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package.

First, let's establish the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had:
- Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.

Next, let's account for the Post-it notes she used at work:
- She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

After purchasing the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had would be:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes remaining would be:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

According to the problem, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( \boxed{163} \)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, we calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This is calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. This is done by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ 7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's revenue ($480), we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:

$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Adopted Kittens:**

2. **Kittens Born to House Cats:**
   - Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
     - Number of adopted kittens = 7
     - Number of kittens from Patchy = 3 * 7 = 21
   - Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Number of Kittens:**
   - Kittens from adopted cats = 7
   - Kittens from Patchy = 21
   - Kittens from Trixie = 12

   Adding these together:
   \[
   7 + 21 + 12 = 40

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, let's sum up the oranges that are not good:
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Total non-good oranges:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

The number of good oranges is the total number of oranges minus the non-good oranges:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider both the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% of the value of the pension she becomes entitled to starting after 20 years.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension**: Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.

2. **Additional Pension After 20 Years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the fixed annual pension is $50,000, 5% of this amount is:
   \[
   0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and apply the given conditions.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the amounts from both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information provided.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:
\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons of gas. Using the fuel efficiency we just calculated:
\[ \text{Miles per Tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive \(\boxed{300}\) miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
36

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people sent.
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (Top Level):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 3:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 2:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 1 (Bottom Level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then consider the rest of the year.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the year:**
   - There are 365 days in a year.
   - The first 180 days are already accounted for, so the remaining days in the first year are \( 365 - 180 = 185 \) days.
   - For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = dog food for the first 180 days + dog food for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total dog food for the first year = \( 180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups} \).

4. **Determine the number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use \(\boxed{5}\) bags of dog food in the first year."

"First, let's calculate how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we know that a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed so far is:

\[ \text{Total water distributed} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is directly proportional to the duration).

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends. To find out how many will show up, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina will need. She plans to give 0.75 gift bags per invited guest who shows up. Therefore, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Therefore, Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10% of his original time. Therefore, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

\[ 10\% \text{ of 40 seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Subtracting this from his original time gives us his new time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Cars that drove through the traffic jam**: After the 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that remained and had to drive through the traffic jam is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.

4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam.

5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Since 25 cars in total drove through the traffic jam and 20 of them did so in the last 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is \(25 - 20 = 5\) cars.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away:

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away:

The number of potted plants she will have left is the total number of potted plants she already has minus the number of potted plants she will give away:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday to the number of plants she will have left after giving some away:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

6 pages per day"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given about the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"

"First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which totals \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so \(x\) episodes would be \(0.5x\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total hours of TV watched:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).

According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we add the number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice to find the total number of roll-ups eaten:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per teacher per day**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Whiteboard usage per lesson**: Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each of their lessons.
4. **Cleanings per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day for all teachers combined:
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Lessons per teacher per day} \]
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = \text{Total lessons per day} \times \text{Cleanings per lesson} \]
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \).

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50x \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Prices have increased by 50%.
   - New price per board = \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board = \( \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

3. **Total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Selling price of 2x4x10 boards + Selling price of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total selling price = \$150 + \$120 = \$270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

1. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost
   - Profit = \$270 - \$180 = \$90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the total parts of the mixture is 20, each part of the mixture corresponds to \(\frac{120}{20} = 6\) teaspoons.

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

"First, we calculate the number of vehicles already at the port from the initial 2 containers:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's determine Lylah's initial salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Now, we need to determine Lylah's salary four years later. Since both salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

1. The cost for 4 watermelons:
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. The cost for 20 peppers:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since Nissa initially hired 60 elves, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.

2. Subtract the 20 elves who quit from the initial 60 elves to find the remaining number of elves:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 elves remain.

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Subtract these 10 elves from the 40 remaining elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the final number of elves left is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure for June.

1. Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.
2. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so we subtract $60 from $500 to find his June expenditure:
   \[
   500 - 60 = 440
   \]
   Therefore, Joseph's expenditure in June was $440.

3. To find the total expenditure for both months, we add the expenditures of May and June:
   \[
   500 + 440 = 940
   \]

Thus, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of \(2 + 2 = 4\) rides.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) rides.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred combined:

- Total rides = Pam's rides + Fred's rides = \(4 + 6 = 10\) rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:

- Total tickets = Total rides \(\times\) Tickets per ride = \(10 \times 6 = 60\) tickets.

Therefore, they used 60 tickets that day."
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

Step 1: Monthly cost of car washes
Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15.
So, the monthly cost is \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.

Step 2: Annual cost
There are 12 months in a year, so the annual cost is \(60 \times 12 = 720\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Brian now has 15 video games. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee on the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items gives:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip to the total:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[29.00\]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed in the first test:

- The test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

To find out how many questions he completed, we multiply his rate by the time he had:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions and he completed 40 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed in the second test:

- The test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

To find out how many questions he completed, we multiply his rate by the time he had:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions and he completed 30 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]
\[ B = 2Q \]

Now substitute these expressions into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest:**
   - There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - John has 10 hectares.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is \(100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}\).

2. **Determine the number of harvests in a year:**
   - John can harvest every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \(12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - Each harvest yields 1000 pineapples.
   - There are 4 harvests in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is \(1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples}\).

**Final Answer:**
4000 pineapples"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 60 bees have now returned.

To find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we need to account for the bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours.

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30 bees
- Bees that returned in the next 6 hours: 15 bees
- Bees that left in the following 6 hours: 60 bees

The total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees} \]

Out of these 90 bees, 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that did not return in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees} \]

These 75 bees are the ones that returned in the last 6 hours.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner and Tim is the loser, we need to find the difference in their times:
- Difference in time: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
4"
"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
- Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains 6 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with $10.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of french fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, each lasting 1 hour. So, for each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in classes.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours spent in classes on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes:

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, each lasting 2 hours. So, for each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in classes.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours spent in classes on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week is \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one semester is \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
272

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

1. **Rolls**: Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
   \[
   300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
   \[
   120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Baguettes**: Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is 24 inches long.
   \[
   60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we sum the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
\frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\).

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\).

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\).

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:
\[400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\].

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \text{ yards/run} \times 15 \text{ runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards/run} \times 34 \text{ runs} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which doesn't change the total number of tadpoles he sees because they were already part of the 11. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so those 2 are no longer visible to Finn. 

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we subtract the 2 hidden tadpoles from the initial count:

11 - 2 = 9

Finn can now see 9 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish.
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.

So, the total number of fish caught by Anakin is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

So, the total number of fish caught by Locsin is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin to find the overall total:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price = $20
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase every two months:**
   - Increase every two months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months = 36 / 2 = 18

4. **Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months:**
   - Total increase = Increase every two months * Number of two-month periods
   - Total increase = $4 * 18 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months:**
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92."

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Total lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference in money:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she spends $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in potential income.
   - The net difference in money = $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we add these costs together:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into this equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item in the uniform:

1. **Hat**: The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. **Jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) dollars.

For the second week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from the first week + Earnings from the second week
- Total earnings = \( 50 + 80 = 130 \) dollars.

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \( \boxed{130} \) dollars for the first two weeks."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and that this number is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:

"First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

So, two years ago, half of Jan's age was:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, two years ago, Mark was:
\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \]

This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is:
\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

We also know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is:
\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Thus, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed and the given conditions.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of rats is unknown, but we can denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of hamsters is unknown, but we can denote the number of hamsters in each cage as \( h \).

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits.
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total amount of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces.

We can set up the equation for the straw distributed to the rats and hamsters:

\[
3r \times 6 + 10h \times 5 = 160
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
18r + 50h = 160
\]

We need to find the values of \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. Since the problem states that the hamsters are kept alone in 10 cages, and the total straw for the hamsters is 50h, we can assume that the number of hamsters per cage is 1 (since the problem does not specify otherwise).

So, \( h = 1 \):

\[
18r + 50 \times 1 = 160
\]

Simplify further:

\[
18r + 50 = 160
\]

Subtract 50 from both sides:

\[
18r = 110
\]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[
r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6.11
\]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the context, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem setup or an assumption that needs to be rechecked. However, based on the given data and the requirement for a whole number of rats, the closest whole number solution would be:

\[
r = 6
\]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

First, calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- There are 10 ducks in the flock.
- Therefore, the total weekly requirement is \(3.5 \times 10 = 35\) pounds.

Next, calculate the daily requirement:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the daily requirement is \(35 \div 7 = 5\) pounds.

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

At noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

Therefore, Baldur gets \(\boxed{55}\) liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we calculate the new salary after the 5% raise. A 5% raise on his current salary means his new salary is:

\[ 104000 + (104000 \times 0.05) = 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year. He receives his regular salary plus the one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:

\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:
     \[

"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g}
\]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g}
\]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Her parents pay her $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sara earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months.

The total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned.

The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."

   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount of the remaining water. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

The final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. A third of $15000 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, the travel time by car is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. Therefore, the total travel time is the sum of the travel time by bus and the travel time by car:

\[ 6 \text{ days (by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add up all these costs:

\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:

\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

This means 36 watermelons were taken home, leaving:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons remaining at the farm. When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were harvested, leaving:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the subtotal.

\[ \text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the subtotal to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. Given that there were 50 ants, the number of bugs would be:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are left sunbathing after some of them have left to swim in the ocean or go inside the cave to eat.

1. **Total number of penguins initially sunbathing:** 36

2. **Number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. **Number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

4. **Total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing:**
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Number of penguins still left sunbathing:**
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat together per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week is:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

We know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, the number of pizzas required is:

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining each of their ages based on the information given.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68

"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. The number of students remaining after this is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. The number of students remaining after this is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 280 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[ R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both.

1. Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, which totals 3 books.
2. Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, which totals 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, and each book is read by at least one person, we simply add the number of books each person has:

- Dolly's books: 2
- Pandora's book: 1

Total books read = 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

Each book is read by at least one person, so the total number of books read collectively is 3.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from his pen pals each week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in response. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes each week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages (responses)} + 30 \text{ pages (replies)} = 60 \text{ pages} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing each week is:

\[ 60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes included in the plan:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\)

3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:**
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\)

4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries:**
   - Let the number of fries Ginger gave be \(x\)
   - Fries with Griffin after receiving from Ginger: \(9 + x\)

5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:**
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\)

6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:**
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\)

7. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   7 + x = 27 \\
   x = 27 - 7 \\
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final answer:**

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[
7

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since Jean gets a 10% discount for the amount of work done, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

Therefore, Jean paid:

\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies:

- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Total calories:**
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is \(3 \times 12 = 36\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of animals Rick killed over the two days:

- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, 8 stalls will have \(8 \times 22 = 176\) cows.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
176

"First, calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Next, determine the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, they left 70% of the redwood intact. Calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

"First, let's determine how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. Adding these together, we get:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee Calculation:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

2. **Transfer Fee Calculation:**
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

3. **Total Price Calculation:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

4. **Comparison with Budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz's budget = $400,000
   - Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
   - Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Selling Price**: $400,000

2. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Next, we calculate the total expenses:
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
\]

Finally, we calculate the net proceeds by subtracting the total expenses from the selling price:
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000

"First, let's break down the time taken for each step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

**Final answer:**
71 minutes"
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the overall total cost:
- The total cost for the newspaper ads is $250.
- The total cost for the television ads is $1125.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on all the ads is \( 250 + 1125 = 1375 \) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses combined:

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, each house has:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
\[ 2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows per house} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
\[ 2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows per house} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

To find the total number of windows between the houses, we add the windows in the bedrooms to the additional windows:
\[ 12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is:

"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches that the body of the sweater takes, we have:

\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stitches for the rosette. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette by adding the stitches for these parts together:

\[ \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The remaining stitches are used for the two sleeves. To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater:

\[ \text{Stitches for the two sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

\[ \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total amount spent = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \text{ cents} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of stars (76) to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows.
3. Divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows.

Let's start with step 1:
- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives:
\[24 + 12 = 36\] stars

Now, we subtract this from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[76 - 36 = 40\] stars

Finally, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine how many trucks are needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
83
\]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's break down the activities Darren does on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

**Total count of activities he's done in the two days:**
370"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members eating rice at each meal, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Next, add the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, subtract the total number of crates sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

55"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Bid**: Carmen bids after the third other bidder, so her bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- Opening bid: $200
- First bid: $250
- Second bid: $300
- Third bid: $350
- Winning bid: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1500 \]

Thus, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is \(\boxed{1500}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **$31,800**."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, will produce two pages on the front and two pages on the back, totaling four pages.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires pages to be printed in a specific order, we can deduce that each piece of paper will contribute 4 pages to the tabloid. Therefore, to find out how many pieces of paper are needed, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can produce:

\[
\frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much money is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount of money left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (the third year).
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - The number of unsold books is 50.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).
   - The number of books sold in the second year is the total sold minus the books sold in the first and third years: \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 65.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:

- Watson works 5 days a week.

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Now, let's add the weekly bonus:

- Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.

So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Finally, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April typically has 4 weeks.

So, his total earnings for April are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, we determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in one week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we use the following calculation:

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from each item and then sum them up.

1. **Savings from ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
   - For 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

2. **Savings from milk:**
   - Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
   - For 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

3. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings = Savings from ice cream + Savings from milk
   - Total savings = $4 + $2 = $6

Therefore, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6."

   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Adding the extra arms and legs together:
- Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since each business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[13 \times 7 = 91\]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age is:
   \[
   30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age is:
   \[
   27 + 5 = 32
   \]

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \(D\).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \(2D\).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \(\frac{1}{2}D\).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[3.5D = 105\]

To find \(D\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:
\[D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30\]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. Therefore, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Adding the 20 marbles Solomon bought and the 8 marbles his father gave him, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial total number of people at the party.
2. Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.
3. Determine the number of women who left.
4. Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.

**Step 1: Determine the initial total number of people at the party.**

The initial number of men is 25, and the initial number of women is 15. Therefore, the total number of people at the beginning is:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.**

It is given that 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of women who left.**

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of men initially was 25, the number of men who left is:
\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.**

The initial number of women was 15, and 7 of them left. Therefore, the number of women who stayed is:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = \text{Total number of pencils} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Number of loose pencils} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 \]

So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since Jam has 3 boxes and these boxes contain 24 pencils, the number of pencils per box is:
\[ \text{Number of pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, let's consider the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:
\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = \text{Pencils Jam has} + \text{Pencils Meg has} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, assuming each box can hold 8 pencils, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes are used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling per ice cube:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Effect of Ice Cubes on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\):
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:

"To fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, the phone needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon took:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[
\text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the $43 spent:

\[
\text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we find 40 percent of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."

DJ has 8 guns,
Nick has 10 guns,
RJ (assuming this is a typo and should be Richard) has 5 guns,
Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together: \(8 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 28\) guns in total.

Next, we need to divide the total number of guns equally among the four of them:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 7 guns.

Each of them would have 7 guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of suckers.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, he needs \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, he needs \( 70 \) ounces of sugar.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 + 70 = 310 \) ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. Therefore, the new price per share after the first year is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the second year is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in the three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).
2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write:
   \[
   H + C = 60
   \]
4. Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the equation \( H + C = 60 \):
   \[
   2C + C = 60
   \]
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   \[
   C = 20
   \]
5. Now, we can find the number of chickens:
   \[
   H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

6. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = (40 \times 2) + (20 \times 4) = 80 + 80 = 160
   \]

The total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks away, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls in total (1 ball per week for 4 weeks).

So, the number of balls Josh can juggle at the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial balls)} + 4 \text{ (balls added over 4 weeks)} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial balls)} - 3 \text{ (dropped balls)} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds (given)
2. **Blue Beetle**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. **Red Bird**: 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
- **Blue Beetle**: 50 pounds
- **Green Toad**: 50 pounds
- **Yellow Snake**: 60 pounds

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos. The formula to calculate the percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total amount of money Andrea had initially.
2. Subtract the amount she spent on the sweater.
3. Subtract the amount she gave to her brother.
4. The result will be the amount she saved.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater. So, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   36 - 11 = 25
   \]
3. She then gave her brother $4. So, the remaining amount after giving her brother money is:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her budget.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends:**
   - A round of mini-golf costs $5.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite.
   - Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is \( 5 \times (n + 1) \).

2. **Cost of arcade tokens:**
   - Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.

3. **Cost of go-karts:**
   - Each go-kart ride costs $10.
   - Morgan and her friends will ride the go-karts twice each.
   - Therefore, the total cost for go-karts is \( 10 \times 2 \times (n + 1) = 20 \times (n + 1) \).

4. **Total budget:**
   - Morgan's budget is $90.

Now, we set up the equation for the total cost and solve for \( n \):

\[
5 \times (n + 1) + 5 + 20 \times (n + 1) = 90
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5(n + 1) + 20(n + 1) + 5 = 90
\]

\[
25(n + 1) + 5 = 90
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
25(n + 1) = 85
\]

Divide both sides by 25:

\[
n + 1 = \frac{85}{25}
\]

\[
n + 1 = 3.4
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
n = 2.4
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't invite a fraction of a friend), we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{2}\) friends."
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets in total over 5 days from her parents. Since she gets $5 every day, over 5 days she will have:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, she spends $1 each day on lollipops. Over 5 days, the total amount spent on lollipops is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money she saves each day, we subtract the amount spent on lollipops from the amount she gets each day:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy had left after buying the gumballs is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying the gumballs is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 16/2 = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4}{3}} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

20"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we add the times for both segments to find the total time of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to ensure that the total points from all three tests sum to at least 42 points.

First, we add the points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 \text{ points} + 18 \text{ points} = 33 \text{ points} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach at least 42 points:
\[ 42 \text{ points} - 33 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. 

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Since 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence as follows:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Since Sara has 8 points, three times Sara's points would be:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin now has 24 points. The problem states that Erin scored 14 points to reach this total. Therefore, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current total of 24 points:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames for all 44 seniors. Each picture frame costs $20, and there is an additional 20% cost for etching the logo.

The cost of etching per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost per frame including etching is:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for 44 seniors to receive picture frames and etching is:
\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins for 2 seniors. Each pin costs $5, so the total cost for the pins is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. There are 1/4 of the seniors who are officers, so the number of officers is:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ officers} \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:
\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1208 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1208} \]"
"To determine the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY approach and subtract that from the original market price.

1. Calculate the savings from the DIY approach:
   - The savings is 20% of the original market price.
   - Original market price = $400.
   - Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.

2. Subtract the savings from the original market price to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Original market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."

   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
   - Number of shoes sold on Friday: \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Number of shoes sold on Saturday: \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the amount of shoes sold on Saturday.
   - Number of shoes sold on Sunday before returns: \( \frac{56}{2} = 28 \) shoes.
   - Six pairs were returned, so the number of shoes returned is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) shoes.
   - Number of shoes sold on Sunday after returns: \( 28 - 12 = 16 \) shoes.

4. **Total number of shoes sold:**
   - Sum of shoes sold on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \( 28 + 56 + 16 = 100 \) shoes.

"To determine the total number of hours Hallie spent on dance practice each week, we need to add up the hours from each day she practiced.

1. On Tuesdays, Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as on Tuesdays, which means it was \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from each day:
\[ 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice each week.

"First, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment is faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

"Mary has 30 sheep, half of which produce 1 kg of milk and the other half produce 2 kg of milk every day.

First, calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each will produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each will produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk produced by both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman initially made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, 12 - 6 = 6 rolls remained.

"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

pupils who do not like blue. Out of these remaining 20 pupils, one-fourth likes green. So, the number of pupils who like green is:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14 apples. Adding the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday, we get:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks (since 1 pair = 2 socks), and 15 loose socks.

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies and received 42 more from Janet. So, the total number of cookies she had before her brother ate any is:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year), the interest rate is:
\[ 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{10}{100} \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{5}{120} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.041667 \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{24} = 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 152.0833 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.0833 \approx 3802.0833 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.0833}{5} \approx 760.4167 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had be \( x \) hectares.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of these girls can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   - Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 8 pencils:
   - Each pencil costs $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

3. Add the cost of the erasers and the pencils to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
   - Total cost = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

The total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's cost with tickets: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up the time spent on each activity:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since she saw 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we calculate how many 2-cup bags of flour Mark needs:
- \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)

Then, we calculate how many 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs:
- \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items Sally bought:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of the more dangerous candles

First, we calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that might explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles also smell like wet dog. Since the problem does not specify a different percentage for the wet dog smell among the exploding candles, we assume that the 5% applies to the entire batch of candles, not just the exploding ones. Therefore, we calculate 5% of the 500 candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode} = 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

Final numerical answer:

Now, let's determine how many apples Joanne's sister gathers:

1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of apples:

\[30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) the size of Zack's locker.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) cubic inches.

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, we know that Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, we know that the first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 20 cats that were taken away from the initial 50 cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs based on the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\$284
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations. Let \( S_j \) be the savings from the jogger jeans and \( S_t \) be the savings from the tattered jeans. We know:
\[ S_j + S_t = 6 \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ P_j - 22 = 2 \]
Solving for \( P_j \):
\[ P_j = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_t \) be the original price of the tattered jeans. The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ P_t - 28 = 4 \]
Solving for \( P_t \):
\[ P_t = 28 + 4 = 32 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ P_t - P_j = 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost \(\boxed{8}\) dollars more than the tattered jeans."
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. We know that each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders. Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. The total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she built is \(3 \times 30 = 90\). The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(90 + 60 = 150\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

The additional cost for the soup is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the soup is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cost of the cake is half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has after buying the ticket is $50 (spending cash) + $100 (ticket) = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100 cards.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

2. **Additional Guests:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than the initial 36 guests.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the initial 36 guests.
   - Since 4 additional guests showed up, the caterer had to prepare an additional 4 hotdogs for these guests.

3. **Total Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - The total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 4 = 40\).

4. **Hotdogs Needed:**
   - All 40 guests wanted a second hotdog.
   - The initial 36 guests who were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each would need an additional 36 hotdogs.
   - The 4 additional guests would need 4 more hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for a second hotdog is \(36 + 4 = 40\).

5. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 40 hotdogs.
   - 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, and 40 hotdogs were available.

Since the number of hotdogs prepared (40) matches the number of hotdogs needed (40), all guests got a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
0 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. This means he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his friends. Since he has four friends and he shared the lollipops equally, each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces have been eaten. Since the cake was divided equally, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{servings} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"

Therefore, the house's final temperature is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse consumes. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay per mile. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will consume:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael will have after buying the hay is:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs that were loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, we calculate Joey's new score after his turn in Scrabble. Joey initially has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points. So, Joey's new score is:

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, we calculate Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points. So, Marcy's new score is:

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning. We do this by subtracting Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all sales is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

The salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's break down the costs and savings step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of popcorn and soda minus the cost of the super ticket equals $2.
   - Mathematically, this can be written as: \((15 + P) - 21 = 2\)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   15 + P - 21 = 2
   \]
   \[
   P - 6 = 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 8
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 65 \times 170
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
65 \times 170 = 65 \times (100 + 70) = (65 \times 100) + (65 \times 70) = 6500 + 4550 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. **Calculate the distance for the first part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Calculate the distance for the second part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first part + Distance of second part = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time of first part + Time of second part = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. Together, they eat \(4 + 4 = 8\) apples a day. Over 30 days, they would eat \(8 \times 30 = 240\) apples.

240"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ 32 \text{ cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \text{ beds} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds

2. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds

3. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds

4. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from aluminum cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from plastic bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 10th place (since there are 10 positions in a race).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(10 - 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 - 1 = 4\). So, she is now in 4th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 4th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final payment is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. First, we calculate 10 percent of $10.00:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total, Kelly's final payment is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he adds 10 shoes to his collection.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

- Initial shoes: 200
- Shoes added on Monday: 10
- Shoes added on Wednesday: 30
- Shoes added on Friday: 60
- Shoes removed on Saturday: 180

Total shoes by the end of Saturday:

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils at the start of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]
So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to determine the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \text{ inches/remora} \times 2 \text{ remoras} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class = 32

First, we calculate the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This is given by the formula for the union of two sets:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, we calculate how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. According to the problem, the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we need to find the combined weight of both pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}
\]
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

Thus, the combined weight of the two pennies is:
\[
\boxed{84}

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay needed to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and then subtract this from their goal.

1. Calculate the total amount earned by Keegan and Tashay by 3 pm:
   - Keegan earned $83.
   - Tashay earned $91.
   - Total earned = $83 + $91 = $174.

2. Subtract the total amount earned from their goal to find out how much more they need to earn:
   - Their goal is $200.
   - Amount still needed = $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. According to the problem, the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, we calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest temperatures for each country:
   - Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

2. Sum these temperatures:
   \[
   -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
   \]

3. Divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{-30}{3} = -10
   \]

The average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to place on the tray is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, the family-size pizza costs $24.

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts. Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs cost:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack:
\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many razors Heather gets for $2.00. Since each pack contains 4 razors and she buys 2 packs (but only pays for 1), she gets:
\[ 4 \text{ razors from the paid pack} \]
\[ 4 \text{ razors from the free pack} \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]

25"
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid would be the height of the shortest person at the top, as they are the limiting factor in determining the overall height of the structure.

The height of the human pyramid is therefore 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Angela is 38 years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for the morning rides.
2. Calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the morning rides.**
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning 14 days.
- Total cost for morning rides = $6/day * 14 days = $84.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides.**
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon 14 days.
- Total cost for afternoon rides = $2/day * 14 days = $28.

**Step 3: Add the two amounts together.**
- Total cost for morning rides = $84.
- Total cost for afternoon rides = $28.
- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by three to find out how many pies they can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43\]

The number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total amount of yarn they used altogether is:
\[ \boxed{273} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her friends based on their initial requests:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts based on initial requests is:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the initial total:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
26"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. 

First, let's calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood:
- From a 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can get 200 sticks.
- From a 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get 400 sticks.

Next, let's determine the cost of each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6.

Since Frederick has $24 to spend, we need to see how many of each type of wood he can buy and how many sticks he can get from them.

If he buys only 2 x 4 pieces:
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.
- Each piece gives 200 sticks, so 6 pieces give \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

If he buys only 2 x 8 pieces:
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.
- Each piece gives 400 sticks, so 4 pieces give \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks).

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

1600"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can calculate the number of pairs needed as follows:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the snowshoes. Given that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost of not having the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the farm and the zoo have a combined total of 120 animals."
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given about Rose's purchases. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of onions Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
\[ 12 = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
\[ 4 = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
To find the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought to find the total number of items she purchased:
\[ \text{Total number of items Sophia bought} = \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} + \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July (up to July 19th): 19 days

   Adding these up:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, calculate the total distance Hannah will run:

Each lap is 0.25 km, and she needs to run 8 laps, so the total distance is:
\[ 0.25 \, \text{km/lap} \times 8 \, \text{laps} = 2 \, \text{km} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:

Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she will run 2 km, the total amount of water she needs is:
\[ 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 2 \, \text{km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

After buying clothes, Julie had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

After buying CDs, Julie had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, at $4 per pack. So, the total number of canvas bags is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags} \]

The total cost for these 40 bags is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4/\text{pack} = \$32 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the 40 bags at $8 each:

\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$320 - \$32 = \$288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

Next, we calculate how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. The amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

Next, we need to calculate double the time Rob takes. Double of 120 minutes is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, we add 40 minutes to 240 minutes.

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Adding this to her current daily consumption:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Next, we need to find out the rate for 5 people working together. Since one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, 5 people working together would paint a whole house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

Now, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days would be \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48"
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can calculate the number of CDs he could buy as follows:

Total money available / Cost per CD = Number of CDs
$48 / $4 = 12

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
12"

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

16"
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma has made 54 vlogs so far. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18"
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the tip amount is $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount to be paid.

Total amount = Original bill + Tip
Total amount = $50 + $10 = $60

Since you want to pay the additional 20% tip, you end up paying the full total amount of the bill.

Therefore, you end up paying $60."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left. Therefore, the amount he has now is:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to understand the structure of the month and the saving pattern.

April has 30 days, which can be divided into two halves:
- First half: 15 days
- Second half: 15 days

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

In the second half of the month, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, his daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of the month would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the entire month is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's total savings for the month should be $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

- The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

   Jonathan wants his play set to be five times larger than James's play set.
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs:**
   Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys.
   Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered:

1. The cost of the hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20\)
2. The cost of the packs of potato fries: \(10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$3\)
3. The cost of the cans of fruit drinks: \(5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost:
\[
\$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33
\]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find the change she receives:
\[
\$50 - \$33 = \$17
\]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Additional commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Additional commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Additional commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill expects to give out. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes \(\boxed{54}\) minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

1. There are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14
   \]

2. The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
   \[
   21 - 7 = 14
   \]
   So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   14 \times 4 = 56
   \]

3. Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives:
   \[
   14 + 56 = 70
   \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[
70
\]"
"First, let's determine the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time Elapsed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of the Sun**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is calculated as:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground is the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the second son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs a number of candles equal to their age, we add the ages of both sons:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week.

Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).

Let's express the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each of the three teenagers: Richie, Mark, and Anna.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ 80 \text{ (Richie)} + 60 \text{ (Mark)} + 35 \text{ (Anna)} = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. Since he started with $70 and spent $40 from Sunday to Wednesday, the remaining amount is:

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he can buy with $40 is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops in a month. Assuming an average month has 4 weeks:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses} \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month:
\[ 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from her initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total costs, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00.
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is $37.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many crayon muffins she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kate can make \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5. So, \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
4. Next, this value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards. Together, they have \(5 + 2 = 7\) cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when she sets it to 450. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) such that when increased by 4%, it equals 520 degrees. This can be expressed as:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
   - So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and each box contains 90 contacts, we need to determine how many pairs are in 180 contacts:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

$40"
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Next, calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned.

- Water needed = 100 ml/calorie * 1600 calories = 160,000 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 160,000 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speeds, we first need to determine the three speeds:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Weight change from eating Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\).

2. **Weight change from eating donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\).

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - The difference in weight change between eating donuts and Cheerios is \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\).

Therefore, at the end of 5 weeks, Martin will be 15 pounds heavier if he eats donuts for breakfast compared to eating Cheerios."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Total = \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

Therefore, Alex will need **316 seats**."
"Let's break down the weights step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(2 \times 10 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(44 \times 5 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the protein content per day:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day.
   - Each 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 3 \text{ grams of protein} = 2 \times 3 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - John consumes 6 grams of protein each day.
   - Therefore, the protein content in a week is:
     \[

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of 2 implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Total cost for 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The porcelain crown for one implant costs an extra $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown: \( 500 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can determine how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

1. Dogs have 4 legs each.
2. Cats have 4 legs each.
3. Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Next, we add the number of legs from all the pets together:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced after \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert the cost per washing to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ cents per washing}}{60 \text{ washings per pump}} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ cents per pump} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents per pump} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

   - Price after discount: \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \)

2. **Discount on the shorts:**
   - Original price of the shorts: $35
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \)

3. **Total cost after discounts:**
   - Total cost: \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \)

4. **Money left after the purchase:**
   - Joe's initial amount: $50
   - Total cost after discounts: $42.00
   - Money left: \( 50 - 42 = 8.00 \)

\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost to repave is $194 per meter.

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 29100 \, \text{\$}
\]

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost to repave is $194 per meter.

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 95060 \, \text{\$}
\]

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{\$} - 29100 \, \text{\$} = 65960 \, \text{\$}

"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Initial Funding and Duration:**
   - John gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.

2. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - For the first 5 months, the funding is $100,000.
   - For the remaining \(50 - 5 = 45\) months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial funding.
   - 50% more than $100,000 is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(5 \times 100,000 = 500,000\).
   - Cost for the remaining 45 months: \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\).

4. **Total Research Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the remaining 45 months.
   - Total cost = \(500,000 + 6,750,000 = 7,250,000\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is:
30"
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of loads per week:**
   Gary does laundry twice a week.

2. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the number of loads per year is:
   \[
   2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total gallons of water used per year:**
   Each load uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total gallons of water used per year is:
   \[
   104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the water used per year:**
   The cost of one gallon of water is $0.15. Therefore, the total cost of the water used per year is:
   \[
   2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year}
   \]

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince will have to sell from the bull. The bull weighs 750kg.

Next, we determine how much meat Prince sells in a day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the entire 750kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the number of remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights per intersection is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck during the week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[

The total number of cars towed that week is \(\boxed{54}\)."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so the total revenue is:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost to the company for acquiring these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car, so the cost per car is:
\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
Therefore, the total cost for the company to acquire 10 cars is:
\[ 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:
\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, the price of a silver jewel is:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:**
   - Distance to be covered: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's determine the cost per class based on the total cost and the number of classes. Manny signed up for $60 worth of classes, and there are 10 total classes.

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will sign him up again. Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will have taken \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class will then be:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class is still less than or equal to $10:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, the cost for 5 apples is \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, the cost for 5 oranges is \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of business news articles published by the second website.**

The second website publishes an average of 10 articles per day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the second website is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

**Step 3: Add the two totals together to get the combined total.**

The combined total number of articles published by both websites in February is:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

Therefore, the total number of articles published by the two websites together in February is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so he is \(64 / 2 = 32\) years old.
4. Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"First, we determine the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is calculated as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms, the total amount of flour in three bags is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked separately and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. Since he has to dig through 24 feet of soil, the time taken to dig through the soil is:

\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. He digs through clay at half the speed he digs through soil, which is:

\[ \text{Speed through clay} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]

Since he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, the time taken to dig through the clay is:

\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the type of cupcakes each person will get.

1. Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. This makes a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Howie)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people}
   \]

2. Each person will receive 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). Therefore, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
   \[
   27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

So, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes Recently**: She received 20000 more new likes recently.
   \[
   \text{Total likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{Additional likes} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is:
\[
\boxed{160000}

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount earned from green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total earnings for the first month.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second month.
4. Sum the earnings from both months.

**Step 1: Determine the amount earned from green hats in the first month.**

Ariadne earned $400 from red hats, which is half the amount she earned from green hats. Therefore, the amount earned from green hats is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for the first month.**

The total earnings for the first month are the sum of the earnings from red and green hats:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings for the second month.**

The earnings for the second month are \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total earnings of the first month:
\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the earnings from both months.**

The total earnings for the two months are:
\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he effectively pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is $15 + $60 = $75.

Therefore, James paid $75."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount received to find out how much was withheld.

First, we find out how much money Sally received this week. Her bank account started with $200 and now has $420. The difference between these amounts is the total money received this week:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. Since she received $220, the difference between her expected wage and the amount she received is the amount that was withheld:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount of money withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Total dozens of eggs needed = \( \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Lori will need **2 dozens** of eggs."
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

**She has 10 pages left to write.**"
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages. To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days. Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we can calculate how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading:

\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the plane. The plane itself costs $150,000.

Next, we need to calculate the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel. The cost to rent a hanger is $5000 per month. The cost for fuel is twice the cost of the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Now, we add the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the total maintenance cost for the first year:
\[ 150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \boxed{330000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cooking times for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - Given: 30 minutes.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

The apple pie cost is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the weekly class time is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class runs for 6 weeks, so the total class time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Since Kassidy has $90, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

"To determine how many good days Christina had left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so she had 8 good days in the first 8 days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days were recorded in this period.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days were recorded in this period.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means she had 2 more good days in these 3 days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of good days:
- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the next 3 days: 2

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

So, the total number of good days in the month is 10.

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the additional height the bamboo needs to reach 600 inches. This is calculated by subtracting the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the additional height needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has enough toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has enough toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 8 toys.
   - After the second purchase, he needed 12 more toys.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

- Together, they have \(20 + 44 = 64\) signatures.

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach 100:
- Their goal is 100 signatures.
- They currently have 64 signatures.
- Therefore, they need \(100 - 64 = 36\) more signatures.

So, the sisters need to collect \(\boxed{36}\) more signatures to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's determine how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, we can calculate how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack:

- Weight of one adult: 80 kg
- Number of adults: 8
- Weight of 8 adults: \( 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \)

- Weight of Jack: 80 kg

- Total weight: \( 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \)

- Excess weight: \( 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \)

The final numerical answer is:
20 kg"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has and then sum them up.

1. **Katarina's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Max's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookie Monster's Cookies:**
   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Summer's Cookies:**
   Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has:
   \[
   73 + 23 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Total Cookies:**
   Now, we sum up the cookies each person has:
   \[
   68 \text{ (Katarina)} + 73 \text{ (Max)} + 61 \text{ (Cookie Monster)} + 96 \text{ (Summer)} = 308

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times for both halves of the lawn:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have.

1. Total time available: 30 minutes
2. Time taken to walk to the corner (library): 6 minutes
3. Time taken to walk from the corner to the fire station: 13 minutes

First, we add the time spent walking to the corner and from the corner to the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples**: 
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4.

2. **Bananas**: 
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges**: 
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. This is the sum of the cookies baked by each: \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

After baking, the pair eats 10 of the cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

So, the number of cookies in the box is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of the individuals are 44, so we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are the same age, we have:
\[ T_1 = T_2 \]

Substituting \( T_2 \) with \( T_1 \) in the combined ages equation, we get:
\[ T_1 + T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know that:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

Substituting \( P_1 \) with \( T_1 - 7 \) in the combined ages equation, we get:
\[ 2T_1 + (T_1 - 7) + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3T_1 - 7 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3T_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 51 \]

Since \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) are the ages of the other two triplets and they are the same age, let's denote their age as \( P \). Therefore:
\[ P_2 = P \]
\[ P_3 = P \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ 3T_1 + 2P = 51 \]

We need to find the values of \( T_1 \) and \( P \) that satisfy this equation. Since \( P_1 = T_1 - 7 \), and \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) are all the same age, we can assume \( P = T_1 - 7 \).

Substituting \( P \) with \( T_1 - 7 \) in the equation, we get:
\[ 3T_1 + 2(T_1 - 7) = 51 \]
\[ 3T_1 + 2T_1 - 14 = 51 \]
\[ 5T_1 - 14 = 51 \]
\[ 5T_1 = 65 \]
\[ T_1 = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong and Neil over these 120 months.

For Rong:
\[ \text{Total savings for Rong} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

For Neil:
\[ \text{Total savings for Neil} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Combined total savings} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1.0\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = 5.0\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6.0\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = 3.0\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = 21.0\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the following equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 4,800 \text{ pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Let \( x \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Then we have:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."

"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is:
\[ 14 \times 12 = 168 \]

Therefore, Alex charges \(\boxed{168}\) dollars for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
     \[
     50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
     \[
     12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

4. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream:**
   - Adding the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
     \]

The total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add up the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, calculate the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet.

\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg is 75 calories.
- Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 oz of cheese.
- Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
- Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
- Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
- Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Finally, let's add up all the calories:
- Total calories = calories from eggs + calories from cheese + calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

The omelet has a total of 770 calories."
"First, calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Cost of one pencil = $0.50
- Number of pencils = 6
- Total cost of pencils = $0.50 × 6 = $3.00

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
- Cost of one eraser = $0.25
- Number of erasers = 8
- Total cost of erasers = $0.25 × 8 = $2.00

Now, add the total cost of pencils and erasers to find the overall cost:
- Total cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers
- Total cost = $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
- Amount paid = $10.00
- Change = Amount paid - Total cost
- Change = $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the change you would get is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews get a job offer:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept it:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes of cereal she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:

\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \, \text{taps}\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \, \text{taps}\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:

\[
\text{Number of students' cars} = 64
\]
\[
\text{Windows per student's car} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Quarter of the students' cars' windows} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:

\[
\text{Number of teachers' cars} = 32
\]
\[
\text{Windows per teacher's car} = 2
\]
\[
\text{Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48
\]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars:

\[
\text{Total windows smashed} = 64 + 48 = 112
\]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

\[
\boxed{112}

"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people in line:** 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00):**

   \]
   So, the number of people remaining after midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. **People who voted by 16:00 (4:00 PM):**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]
   So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- In total, they will need \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- The number of sleeves needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's assume Cindy has one of each type of book (math, science, French, English, and history). We need to calculate the total weight of all these books combined.

The total weight is the sum of the weights of each book:
\[2 \text{ (math)} + 2 \text{ (science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)}\]

Adding these together:

"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

4. **Students who like to play music**: Twice the number that like to play basketball, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music})
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) birds. So, the number of birds left after the stone was thrown is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining 8 birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is \( 8 + 20 = 28 \).

Final numerical answer:
28"
"First, we determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

This means there are 16 girls in each class. To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the total number of slices now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of grooming jobs Melissa has for the week. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal grooming job:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total grooming jobs = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards he received. He received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, plus 30 more cards each worth $50 on average. The total value of the 30 additional cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

- Cost for adults: \(2 \text{ adults} \times \$26/\text{adult} = \$52\)
- Cost for children: \(2 \text{ children} \times \$12/\text{child} = \$24\)
- Total cost for the first amusement park: \(\$52 + \$24 = \$76\)

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

- Cost for adults: \(2 \text{ adults} \times \$14/\text{adult} = \$28\)

- Savings: \(\$76 - \$48 = \$28\)

Therefore, they will be able to save \(\$28\) by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings:
- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Therefore, the daily savings are $0.10 * 500 = $50.

Next, let's find the weekly savings:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide the total number of students by the new number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students.

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students if we are to have groups of equal size. We already have 6 groups, and we need a total of 12 groups. Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays in a 4-week month:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in 20 weekdays, \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs are rented.

2. **Weekends in a 4-week month:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in 8 weekend days, \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs are rented.

3. **Total chairs rented in one 4-week month:**
   - Total chairs rented in weekdays and weekends in one 4-week month is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

4. **Total chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, in two 4-week months, the total number of chairs rented is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas stolen}
   \]
   So, Gunther was left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts to find out how many are left:

- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to get the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

3. **Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them, so she has 20 large stickers left.
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons: 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to small buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total buttons = \(27 + 60 + 60 = 147\).

Therefore, by the end, Lorraine has \(\boxed{147}\) buttons."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( P \) be the total number of puppies. Then:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times P = 18

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. Since the problem asks for a final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \boxed{142.86} \]"

Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of pears and bananas together:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} (reading) - 3 \text{ hours} (video games) = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels needed = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
276"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find 20% of $1000, and then subtract that amount from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

7. **Normal movies**: The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of normal movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
   \]

8. **Cost of normal movies**: Each normal movie costs $10.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for normal movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
   \]

9. **Total cost to replace the movies**: Sum the costs of series movies, older movies, and normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\boxed{4400}

"To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00 \)

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking, then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The Llesis family drove for 4.5 hours (since the total time was 6 hours and they hiked for 1.5 hours).
   - Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance covered by driving is:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \, \text{hours} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} = 225 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their average hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour}
     \]
   - The distance covered by hiking is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 20 \, \text{miles/hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Therefore, the total distance to the vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on. According to the problem, \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects. According to the problem, \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"First, let's determine the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost 30 dollars. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money was spent on the other two pizzas. The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the cost for the other two pizzas is:

\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in those 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
Thus, for the two days, the number of rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days together, the total number of rides in a week is:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \) on one side, we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Isolate \( W \):

\[ 17 - 5 = 3W \]
\[ 12 = 3W \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts to find the total hours Kris has played so far:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:

\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

**Final Answer:**
20 miles"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade and then find the overall pass rate for the school.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340
   - Total number of third-graders: 500
   - Pass rate for third graders: \(\frac{340}{500} = 0.68\) or 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40
   - Total number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Pass rate for fourth graders: \(\frac{40}{100} = 0.40\) or 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Pass rate for fifth graders is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: 0.40
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \(2 \times 0.40 = 0.80\) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \(0.80 \times 400 = 320\)

Now, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school.

- Total number of students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)
- Total number of students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 700\)
- Overall pass rate: \(\frac{700}{1000} = 0.70\) or 70%

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is then:
\[ 3 \times L = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation:
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these four students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these sixteen students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
\[48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first calculate the total number of candies he now has:

\[ 100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies} \]

Dale has sold 150 candies out of the 200 he now has. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

50"
"Let's break down the problem month by month, starting with the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
- Number of students at the end of May: 320

The additional number of students is:
\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Subtract the petals dropped from the initial total:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows to make the S'mores. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After accounting for the marshmallows used and dropped, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

1. Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters.
2. Each of the two friends who can play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters each.
3. The friend who can play for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters.

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68\]

So, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is:

\[68 \times 0.25 = 17\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We can substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation for \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. \]

The total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10. \]
Substituting \( o = 4z \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 10z = 10. \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 1. \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4. \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars Joe gives away or sells is:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy walked over the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert the total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, 20 more cars entered the parking lot. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]
4. **Remaining Cars During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35

"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.**
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.**
John works 7 days a week.
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.**
Each task pays $1.20.
\[ 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$1260 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound for the weight of the book and $0.08 per mile for the distance to the distribution center.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]

Adding these two costs together gives the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Money lost} = 3.00 - 24 = -21 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21 after the refund and the shipping cost. However, the question asks how much money Milly will lose, which in this context means the absolute value of the negative result.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gave her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has before buying anything is:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

After buying the jeans, the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Then, she buys a bag for $20. The cost for the bag is:

\[ 20 \]

After buying the bag, the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then find out how much is left for the fourth week.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the second week is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the third week is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Since Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is the remaining amount after the first three weeks:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[
\boxed{14,000}

"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then multiply by four to find the monthly total.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the weekly time spent on all activities:
- Total weekly time = Time spent recording videos + Time spent writing songs + Time spent doing makeup
- Total weekly time = \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly time spent on TikTok is:
- Total monthly time = \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs additional items: 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

Now, let's calculate the additional costs:

- For 2 more mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- For 1 more chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars.
- For 10 more pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.

Adding these additional costs to the base installation cost:

\[129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324\]

So, the total cost for Angela will be \(\boxed{324}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

First, he travels for 4 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same distance. Since the speed is the same for all kangaroos, the time taken by one kangaroo would also be 18 hours.

Next, we need to find the speed of the turtles. The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours to travel the distance, a turtle, traveling at half the speed, would take twice as long to cover the same distance.

So, the time it takes for one turtle to travel the distance is:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since we are asked how long it will take four turtles to travel the same distance, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time taken by four turtles will be the same as the time taken by one turtle. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance is:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]

Final answer:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Therefore, Rory makes:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40 \text{ clay dishes}
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada makes:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ clay dishes}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora to find the total number of clay dishes they all make together:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the price after the trade-in is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she currently has is:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom has given her $80. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her job, and the money from her mom:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these amounts.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10\) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) millimeters

Now, we sum the lengths of the unused glue from all three glue sticks:
\[10 + 4 + 6 = 20\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{20}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:
- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800
Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:
- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200
Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Amount needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. There are 5 students who are good at math only.
2. There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
3. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects. The total number of students in the class is 20. Subtracting the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total gives us the number of students who are good at both:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Next, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects to find the total number of students who are good at math:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. This is given by:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes long. So, the total time for one group plus the intermission is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute segments fit into the 120-minute concert duration. This is calculated by dividing the total concert time by the time required for one group plus the intermission:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   However, this interpretation seems incorrect because an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical. Instead, we should interpret it as 75% of the original amount per year, which is:
   \[
   r = 0.75 \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   But since the interest rate is typically expressed as a decimal, we should use:
   \[
   r = 0.75
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for one year:**
   \[
   I = P \times r = 300 \times 0.75 = 225
   \]

4. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = I \times \text{number of years} = 225 \times 3 = 675
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{975}

"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- This means the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. In a year, there are 12 months, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, calculate the total cost for the baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for the baskets of red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- Therefore, the total cost for red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the total costs for the green and red food to find the overall total:
- Total cost for green food: $75.
- Total cost for red food: $48.
- Therefore, the total amount you have to pay is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, determine the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel. There are 90 rooms in total, so one-half of the rooms is:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we can establish the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( A = B - 3 \), we get \( S = A - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \).

Now substitute \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of their ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]

Add 9 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6B = 96. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

Next, we add the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars + Number of yellow cars

75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + Number of yellow cars

Now, let's calculate the number of yellow cars:

Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, the carrots weigh:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. To find out how much Madeline pays, we calculate:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining 40%:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month):
\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

After the first day, the number of pieces left is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's sum up all the pieces Tobias has eaten so far:
\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

So, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

1. **Cost of one bottle of soda:**
   - Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is:
     \[
     \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of one bottle of water:**
   - Four bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is:
     \[
     \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   - The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
     \[
     3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
     \[
     2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{13.00}

"To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide the total earnings by the number of hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving more from his friend:

Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from each type of question.

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - Total questions: 10
   - Correctly answered: 80% of 10 = \(0.80 \times 10 = 8\)
   - Points per question: 1
   - Total points from multiple-choice: \(8 \times 1 = 8\)

2. **True/false questions:**
   - Total questions: 20
   - Correctly answered: 90% of 20 = \(0.90 \times 20 = 18\)

Therefore, Amy scores a total of 41 points."
"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens and the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he took to the market is:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Since the cost of the 180 chickens is $7000, the cost per chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{7000}{180} \]

However, the question asks for the total amount Isaias bought the chickens for, which we have already calculated as $7000.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, we can calculate the remaining glasses sold by the boys as follows:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[ \boxed{575} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. Since the rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will get is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we assume Sarah buys a rope of the same length (20 meters):

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah has after selling the original rope to find out how much money she will have left over:

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years old.

3. To find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old, we subtract her current age from 24:
   \[
   24 - 8 = 16
   \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

**Final Answer:**
16"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Budget} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Money left} = $65 - $60 = $5
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. 

To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

Argo now has 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not find any space to fit in. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. Jerry also counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate \(3 \times 8\):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani initially baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, leaving her with \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

Each jar contains 10 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}
\]"
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

1. **Cost of the salad**: $6
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. **Total cost of the salad and yogurt**: $6 + $3 = $9.

Given that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily diet, we can find the total cost of the carrots by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost.

4. **Total cost of the carrots**: $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we can find the cost of one carrot by dividing the total cost of the carrots by 2.

5. **Cost of one carrot**: $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Therefore:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). However, the problem does not provide the exact amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn, but it does give us the total earnings. We can solve for \( L \) directly by isolating it in the equation:
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

Since the problem does not give us the exact value of \( J \), we can infer that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 54 that fits within the $80 total. The only feasible value for \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a reasonable part of $80 is \( J = 1 \) (since \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) is too large).

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ 54J = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting out his car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car each month is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after she bought the additional 5 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they both rowed:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

Therefore, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have two children. If each person has one bowl of soup, the total number of bowls consumed will be:

\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls, and 4 bowls will be consumed by the family, there will be no leftover soup. Therefore, the number of times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost of the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20:
     \[
     \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8:
     \[
     \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - To find the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes out of the 7 he has. Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Now, we can find the total number of shoe boxes left by adding the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, we calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, we subtract the 6 marbles given to Jamie and the 10 marbles given to Donald from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the current ages of Duncan and Adam. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

We can express these conditions mathematically:
- Duncan's age eight years ago: \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago: \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes per bottle} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at, given the total number of bologna pieces and the number of red balloons.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

Substitute the number of red balloons into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the term with \( y \):
\[ 3y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 6 \]

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles required for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\[5 + 10 + 8 = 23\]

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the expenses and calculate the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had initially.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount of money they had initially is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball.

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.

Next, let's add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two activities:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, let's consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we can now add the total number of students from tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the overall total number of students:
\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat in one day. Together, they can eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat together in one day. So, we perform the division \(24 \div 6 = 4\).

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in years and then convert that to months.

From age 5 to age 10, she collected shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months/year:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the number of months she has been collecting, which is 60.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row contains:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Since there are 9 cups in each row, and the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal in number, we can divide the 9 cups in each row into 2 equal parts:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

Final numerical answer:
4.5"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, then over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. So, the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining money is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can buy one more ticket.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see this month is:
\[5 + 8 + 1 = 14\] movies.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40,000 calories.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45,000 calories.
   - Total calories from all pastries: \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"To find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of each type of toy:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of these toys from the overall total to find the number of bouncy balls:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. \]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100, \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100. \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80. \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ J = 20. \]

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's and Peter's ages:
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30, \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

Thus, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Each person initially received 2 water balloons. So, for 5 people, that's 5 * 2 = 10 water balloons.
3. Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. So, for 5 people, that's 5 * 3 = 15 additional water balloons.
4. Adding the initial and additional balloons together: 10 + 15 = 25 water balloons.

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already own, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes. The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Combined total distance: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

Now, we calculate the average total distance spat by dividing the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- For 30 days, the total number of widgets produced is \(60 \times 24 \times 30\).

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- For 30 days, the total number of widgets produced is \(45 \times 24 \times 30\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ widgets}\]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32400 \text{ widgets}\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[43200 \times 6 = 259200 \text{ dollars}\]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[32400 \times 6 = 194400 \text{ dollars}\]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

\[259200 - 194400 = 64800 \text{ dollars}\]

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the cost of the initial 12-hour stay:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters each has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

Each school has 7 rows, and each row consists of 8 children. Therefore, the number of children in one school is calculated as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ children per row} = 56 \text{ children per school} \]

Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children is:

\[ 56 \text{ children per school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:
\[
\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70 loaves.

The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as follows:

1. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]

2. Subtract 40 from this result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}

Therefore, at the end, Jasmine has \(\boxed{13}\) stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales:

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the New York Times is \(5 \times 0.10 = 0.50\) dollars.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \(15 \times 0.08 = 1.20\) dollars.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}\]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley earns is:
\[15.00 \text{ dollars}\]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo’s age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus’s age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pages per inch**: Since the book is printed such that 100 pages are stacked to the inch, there are 100 pages per inch.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages for the given thickness**: The book is 1.5 inches thick. Therefore, the total number of pages is calculated by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness in inches.

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:

\[
100 \times 1.5 = 150

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but on this day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, her wake-up time on this day was 5 minutes before 6 a.m., which is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before starting to sleepwalk:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - Calculate the time from 2:15 a.m. to 3 a.m.: \(3 - 2:15 = 0:45\) (45 minutes).
   - Calculate the time from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.: \(5 - 3 = 2\) hours.
   - Calculate the time from 5 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.: \(55 - 0 = 55\) minutes.
   - Total time awake before sleepwalking: \(45 + 120 + 55 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Calculate the time: \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Kim was actually asleep:**
   - Total usual sleep time: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time awake before sleepwalking: \(480 - 220 = 260\) minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: \(260 - 23 = 237\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
- Currently, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of beds that will be occupied after 2 weeks (14 days) due to the admissions:

- 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total admissions in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the current number of occupied beds to the total admissions to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total occupied beds} \]
\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people that attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of balls each boy carried and then sum them up to find the total number of balls.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, they filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes.

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We sum the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \, \text{miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
\[ 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}
\]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. This is equivalent to 6 brownies (since 1/2 of 12 is 6).
3. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. This is 48 brownies (since 4 times 12 is 48).
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. This is equivalent to 18 brownies (since 1 1/2 is 1.5, and 1.5 times 12 is 18).

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the end of the day:

- Brownies made by Greta: 12
- Brownies received from the office party: 6
- Brownies received from her friends: 48
- Total brownies before the party: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66
- Brownies eaten during the party: 18

Finally, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:

66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, the sister's age is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. **Synthetic Gut Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we sum the total times for each type of stringing:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (one for himself, one for his wife, and one for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is:
\[ \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$300 = \$600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is:
\[ \$1800 \]"
"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cherries Richard has:**
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
   - Therefore, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.

2. **Calculate the total number of cherries shared:**
   - The total number of cherries is 60.
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Richard has 20 cherries.
   - Let \(J\) be the number of cherries Jerry has.
   - The sum of cherries is \(30 + 20 + J = 60\).
   - Solving for \(J\), we get \(50 + J = 60\), so \(J = 60 - 50 = 10\).

3. **Determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:**
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Jerry has 10 cherries.
   - The difference is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( G_S = 10 \)
2. \( A_S = A_U - 4 \)
3. \( G_U = G_S + 5 \)
4. \( A_U = 15 \)

Now, let's solve for the unknowns:
- From equation 3, we substitute \( G_S \):
  \[
  G_U = 10 + 5 = 15
  \]
- From equation 4, we know:
  \[
  A_U = 15
  \]
- From equation 2, we substitute \( A_U \):
  \[
  A_S = 15 - 4 = 11
  \]

Now we have the number of boxes sold for each day:
- On Saturday: \( G_S = 10 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_S = 11 \) boxes of apple pie.
- On Sunday: \( G_U = 15 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_U = 15 \) boxes of apple pie.

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday:
  \[
  10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$60
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday:
  \[
  11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$165
  \]
- Total earnings on Saturday:
  \[
  \$60 + \$165 = \$225
  \]

- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday:
  \[
  15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$90
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday:
  \[
  15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$225
  \]
- Total earnings on Sunday:
  \[
  \$90 + \$225 = \$315
  \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to get the total earnings:
\[
\$225 + \$315 = \$540
\]

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{540}\) dollars for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:
- Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- The vacation lasts for 8 days.

So, the total amount of sunscreen used per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

For 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen used is:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to cover 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract that from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24 be \(D\).
   - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will also be 5 years older.
   - Therefore, the current age of Emil's dad is \(48 - 5 = 43\).

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24 be \(B\).
   - Therefore, \(24 = 2 \times B\).
   - Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will also be 5 years younger.
   - Therefore, the current age of Emil's brother is \(12 - 5 = 7\).

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - The current age of Emil's dad is 43.
   - The current age of Emil's brother is 7.
   - Therefore, the sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this number as follows:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ cheerleaders or band members} \]

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the spacing are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length by the space each plant needs:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

**63**"
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 = \$9.00\)
- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations gives us \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total gives us \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds of soil left for roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is \(3 \div 1 = 3\).

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses.

"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes each month. Since she sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes, and each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we need to determine how many pairs she can buy each month.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 2.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task together:

- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté
- Total time = 15 minutes + 30 minutes
- Total time = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling over 3 hours: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\)

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling over 4 hours: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\)

3. **Air conditioner off for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate without air conditioner: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming over 2 hours: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\)

4. **Net change in temperature:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\)
   - Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years. Therefore, the difference in age between Bill and his dad when they both saw the comet is 75 years. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3D - D = 75
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     2D = 75
     \]
     Solving for \( D \):
     \[
     D = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5
     \]
   - So, Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was \( 3D \) years old, and \( D = 37.5 \), we have:
     \[
     3D = 3 \times 37.5 = 112.5
     \]
   - The time between the first and second sighting is 75 years, so Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is:
     \[
     112.5 - 75 = 37.5
     \]

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{37.5}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
52

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all howls combined:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, so to find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
2. \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours (120 minutes)
3. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (frosting)} + 120 \text{ minutes (cooling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (baking)} + 20 \text{ minutes (making batter)} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:**
   - Lisa sold \(3.5\) boxes.
   - Peter sold \(4.5\) boxes.
   - Total boxes sold = \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

2. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - They sold a total of \(64\) chocolate bars.

3. **Calculate the number of chocolate bars per box:**
   - Total chocolate bars = \(64\)
   - Total boxes = \(8\)
   - Number of chocolate bars per box = \(\frac{64}{8} = 8\)

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
   - Total cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Daily earnings = Total cost per session * Number of sessions per day
   - Daily earnings = $40 * 3 = $120

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of days the studio is rented in a month is 4 weeks * 3 days/week = 12 days.
   - Monthly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a month
   - Monthly earnings = $120 * 12 = $1440

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1440."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of chocolate bars per box)} = 64 \]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:
\[ 7 \times \text{(number of chocolate bars per box)} = 56 \]
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines in the park is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, 8260 gallons of water are needed to fill the pool.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

The total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

   \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

Therefore, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to determine the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours of charging her friends' phones, the power bank was left with 28% of its capacity.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was **94%**."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings if she works 40 hours a week:

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment on the car. She wants to save 20% of the $10,000 car:

Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

Number of weeks = $2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces left to be given to her friends is:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \( \boxed{139} \) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits only. This means there are:

\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

albums that are either selfies or portraits. Since each of these 5 albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"

   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people who checked in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon checkins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. **Dinner Checkins**: 7 more people checked in after dinner.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

The hotel now has \(\boxed{98}\) guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of average and difficult questions combined: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions is the same as the number of difficult questions, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) each.

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  24 \times 0.75 = 18
  \]
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9
  \]
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9
  \]

Now, let's sum up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[
18 + 9 + 9 = 36
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]"
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( \boxed{12} \)."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

1. **Earnings from cookies:**
   - Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each.
   - Total earnings from cookies = \( 80 \times 1 = 80 \) dollars.

2. **Earnings from cupcakes:**
   - Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each.
   - Total earnings from cupcakes = \( 60 \times 4 = 240 \) dollars.

3. **Total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes
   - Total earnings = \( 80 + 240 = 320 \) dollars.

4. **Amount given to sisters:**
   - Suzanne gave $10 to each of her two sisters.
   - Total amount given to sisters = \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

5. **Money left:**
   - Money left = Total earnings - Amount given to sisters
   - Money left = \( 320 - 20 = 300 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total number of eggs hidden was 100. If 60 eggs were found by the Smith twins, then the number of eggs left to be found by their friends is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that out of the 40 eggs that were not found by the Smith twins, only 30 were found by their friends (since 10 were not found at all):
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the amount of ore mined with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Next, we calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day:
\[40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}.\]

Now, we calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:
\[1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}.\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If the price per sandwich is $1.5, then the cost of 8 sandwiches is \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she approached the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 50%.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to the normal teacher giving an extension is \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\) or 20%.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6 (since 100% - 40% = 60%)
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - If Marcus gets a personal extension, he does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to getting a personal extension is \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.06\) or 6%.

Now, we sum up the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 50\% + 20\% + 6\% = 76\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 100\% - 76\% = 24\% \]

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are for graduates and 300 seats are for faculty. Therefore, the number of seats available for guests is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To drop the candy in all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 moves (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds/move} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"First, we calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of apples he can make by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- Cost of Parmesan cheese per pound = $11
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese
- Total cost of Parmesan cheese = 2 pounds * $11/pound = $22

Next, calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- Cost of Mozzarella cheese per pound = $6
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of Mozzarella cheese = 3 pounds * $6/pound = $18

Now, calculate the total cost of both types of cheese:
- Total cost of cheese = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40

Finally, calculate the remaining money after the purchase:
- Amor starts with $50
- Total cost of cheese = $40
- Remaining money = $50 - $40 = $10

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is $10."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college. Since he takes out $50,000 per year, the total loan amount is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After earning his degree, his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would have been:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

After college, he will earn $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year after college, we can find the number of years it will take to earn $300,000 by dividing $300,000 by $75,000:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Amount won in the second race = \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5.
- Total amount won = $11 (second race).

Net amount lost = Total amount lost - Total amount won = $21.5 - $11 = $10.5.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\text{Total net loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

Therefore, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the total number of cities by the population of each city. So, \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the heights are initially given in inches and feet.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked per day:**
   - They worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked per day is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked over the 3 weeks:**
   - Each painter worked 9 hours per day.
   - They worked for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours each painter worked is \(9 \times 21 = 189\) hours.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars. The price of the car after \( n \) years can be calculated using the formula:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^n \]
where the depreciation rate is 0.21 and \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493039 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9861} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive:
\[ \boxed{655} \text{ kilometers} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
\[ 120 + 20 = 140 \]

At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
\[ 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
\[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Originally $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$55 \]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\$2400\)."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \text{ twin beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- \(1 \text{ king bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do based on the machine's capacity:
- The machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
- The machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \text{ twin sheets} \div 2 \text{ twin sheets per load} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \text{ king sheets} \div 1 \text{ king sheet per load} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding the loads together:
- \(104 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 52 \text{ loads for king sheets} = 156 \text{ loads}\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, on Sunday, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies on Saturday and Sunday combined: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, over 4 weeks, they will watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Stickers from two years ago**: Leo had 100 stickers.
2. **Stickers collected last year**: Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. **Stickers collected this year**: Leo collected twice the number of stickers as last year. Therefore, he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year to find the total number of stickers in his collection:

\[
100 \text{ (two years ago)} + 50 \text{ (last year)} + 100 \text{ (this year)} = 250

Thus, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} + 3 = 10 \]

Solving for Jake's slices:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, we can calculate the number of slices Silvia ate as follows:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia by adding their individual slices together:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each charge:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}

"First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a response, so the number of emails that James needs to respond to each day is:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we add the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add the numbers step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. According to the problem, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney now has is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's break down the cost calculation:

1. **Cost without promotion:**
   - 6 pounds of butter at $4.00 per pound would cost \(6 \times 4 = \$24.00\).

2. **Cost with promotion:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost for the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost for the half pound is \(4.00 \times 0.5 = \$2.00\).

   Therefore, for every pound of butter, the total cost is \(4.00 + 2.00 = \$6.00\).

3. **Total cost for 6 pounds:**
   - Since the promotion applies to each pound, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is \(6 \times 6 = \$36.00\).

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. Let's denote Maggie's original amount of money as \( M \). We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, let's determine Riza's original amount of money. Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. Let's denote Riza's original amount of money as \( R \). We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this is the daily consumption, the total consumption for a week (7 days) is:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]
\[24 + x = \frac{315}{7}\]
\[24 + x = 45\]
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{21}

"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed an additional 500 pieces.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles together:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the cost of 15 roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot make the purchase and will not receive any change.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he waits.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Leaves after 65 minutes (60 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 130 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 130 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 130 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 150 minutes.

Paul arrives at the station just as the first train is about to arrive, which is at 10 minutes. His train, the fourth train, arrives at 150 minutes. Therefore, the total waiting time for Paul is:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Paul will wait for a total of 140 minutes."
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from her goal:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 \]
\[ = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 \]
\[ = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 \]
\[ = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the Store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway Point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).
3. **Realization and Return**: James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. **Total Distance Walked**: The total distance James walks is \( 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \).
5. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total length of the fence:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales each hour and then extend that to the full 6 hours.

1. **Bales produced by the farmer per hour:** 5 bales
2. **Bales picked up by the truck per hour:** 3 bales

The net change in the number of bales each hour is:
\[ 5 \text{ bales (produced)} - 3 \text{ bales (picked up)} = 2 \text{ bales (left in the field)} \]

Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales left in the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of each child step by step.

1. **First Child:**
   - Height: 6 feet
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

2. **Second Child:**
   - Height: 2 inches taller than the first child
   - Calculation: \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \)

3. **Third Child:**
   - Height: 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - Calculation: \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - Height: 3 inches taller than the third child
   - Calculation: \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

Thus, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags sold.**

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops initially had 1080 kilograms of meat.

1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

The total number of sodas left is:
2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
25%"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to determine how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so we calculate 20% of 50 days:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

This means Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, each day, Bobby spends:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:

"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount of apples left for Jacques (and James, assuming James is Jacques) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ kg} \]"
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature became:

\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Then, it increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so the temperature became:

\[ -6 + 3 = -3 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Raymond has after saving from his allowance:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since the 2 books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

1. Calculate 20% of 50 students:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

2. Add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the blinking rate per minute:
\[
\text{Blinking rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We use the blinking rate to set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
\]

Now, perform the division:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's pond:

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- Initial female goldfishes: 5

Next, we add the new fish Tate buys:

- New male guppies: 2
- New female guppies: 1
- New male goldfishes: 2
- New female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes after the purchase:

- Total male guppies: 4 (initial) + 2 (new) = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (new) = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (new) = 8

Now, we combine the totals for guppies and goldfishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the total number of female and male fishes:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \boxed{19} hours."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the distance for a round trip:**
   - A round trip means going to his parents' place and coming back.
   - Distance for a round trip = 2 × Distance for one way
   - Distance for a round trip = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Distance for a round trip
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{\text{Distance Sofie walks in 7 days}}{2} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production of these four workers during their 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total production of these four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys during the 10-hour shift.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 for herself.**
   - This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.

2. **Luis gave the rest of his stickers to Kris.**
   - Since Kris received half of what Luis had, Luis must have had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris.**
   - This means Luis had \(32\) stickers initially, and he used half, so he used \(32 / 2 = 16\) stickers and gave the other half (16 stickers) to Kris.

4. **Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.**
   - Since Luis received 32 stickers from Seth, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers initially.

Therefore, Seth had **64 stickers** in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces:

- Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&M, 30 ounces will contain \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&M.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

- The total number of small bags is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \).

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags. 

90"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate half of the Earth's circumference:**
   The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the Earth's circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days it takes for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it takes for him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \text{ mph} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the expression for \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \(S = 9\), we can find \(C\):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline together with Camden and Sarah painted 56 eggs. Since \(A = M\), we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs and Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie and her brother earn combined:

\[ \text{Combined earnings of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we calculate her earnings as:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved in the past 8 weeks. Since she saves $4 every week, we can multiply the weekly savings by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Jane needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week. We divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each tree.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the final tree, which had 3 blue birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we sum all these numbers together:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the original number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the original 36 marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

Final numerical answer:
26"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) is:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over this period and then sum them with the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 days = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Each pack contains 9 bagels, and he orders 4 packs, so the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, 18 scoops will require:
     \[
     18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
     \]

Thus, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans. Since there are 17 green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans are either green or red. We add the number of green and red jelly beans together:

\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jelly beans is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees over a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Each tree yields 6 lemons per year. Therefore, for one tree, the number of lemons collected in one year is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \]

Step 2: Tim grows 5 trees. So, the total number of lemons collected from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 3: To find the total number of lemons collected over a decade (10 years), we multiply the yearly total by 10:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
     \]
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291 \text{ sunflowers}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{291}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks Adam sells. He sells 60% of his inventory:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue:

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Chatty has four children, and she wants to distribute the eggs equally among them. Therefore, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ eggs}}{4 \text{ children}} = 9 \text{ eggs per child}
\]

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of food for the 3 fish.
2. Determine the number of days in May.
3. Calculate the total cost for the month of May.

Step 1: Daily cost of food for the 3 fish.
Each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish.
\[ \text{Daily cost} = 3 \text{ fish} \times \$1/\text{fish} = \$3 \]

Step 2: Number of days in May.
May has 31 days.

Step 3: Total cost for the month of May.

Therefore, Jen spends \(\$93\) on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia initially had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ roses} \]

Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has:
\[ 6 + 15 = 21 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Initial distance: 110 miles
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Initial time: 2 hours
- Additional time: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - The probability of both events happening (both tickets being winners) is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the combined probability is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the combined probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.
   - \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots from Monday to Friday.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots on the weekend.

Adding the carrots from weekdays and the weekend, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots a week.

"First, let's calculate the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \times \frac{60}{100} = 5 \times 0.6 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the length of the first song to get the length of the second song:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the lengths of both songs to get the total length of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is:
\[ 13 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since he makes a profit of $20 per device, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each juice bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need to produce \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \) bottles per person.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers who wear bows:

- Total babies wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple. Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, we calculate the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall total to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]"
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Therefore, the amount of land sold in the first transaction is:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Next, we need to find out how much land he has left after the first sale:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. The amount of land sold in the second transaction is:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

So, the amount of land he has left after the second sale is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

Abraham then sold the remaining 30 square meters of land for $3 per square meter. The money earned from selling the remaining land is:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total money earned from all the sales. The money earned from the first sale is $50, from the second sale is $30, and from the third sale is $90. Therefore, the total money earned is:

\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Geb is 3 years old. 

Geb's age is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 36 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Next, we sum up the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350

"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

To find 1/5 of $100:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Next, we add the $20 that Sophia gave Jack to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting this into the first relationship gives \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and after giving $3 to his little sister, he is left with:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills remaining is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]

This means the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the original 5-inch piece, and then calculate how many days he can continue to use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Chalk used on Monday: \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - Chalk remaining after Monday: \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage and remaining chalk:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk at the start of each day as \( C \).

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Day 1 (Tuesday): \( C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - Day 2 (Wednesday): \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.
   - Day 3 (Thursday): \( C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \) inches.
   - Day 4 (Friday): \( C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \) inches.
   - Day 5 (Saturday): \( C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \) inches.

4. **Check when the chalk falls below 2 inches:**
   - The teacher needs to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - From the calculations, we see that the chalk is still above 2 inches on Friday and Saturday.

5. **Determine the day when the chalk is recycled:**
   - On Sunday, the chalk will be: \( C_6 = 0.90112 \times 0.80 = 0.720896 \) inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the chalk on Sunday. 

**Final Answer:**
The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]
So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]
So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's determine how many face masks Johnny bought. According to the problem, Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many face masks as Mike.

Mike bought 5 face masks. Therefore, thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, add 2 to this number to find out how many face masks Johnny bought:
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

17"
"First, let's determine how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist. This includes both the teeth that were drilled and the teeth that were capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' total teeth (30) this number represents. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{number of fixed teeth}}{\text{total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

The amount of milk that passed the expiry date is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the 1600 gallons of returned milk is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = \frac{1600 \times 35}{10} = \frac{56000}{10} = 5600
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by moving all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other side:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of books he can buy with $27000.

The number of books he can buy with $27000 is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the money is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
\]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up the two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - He put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - He threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton threw the apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples.

Now, let's count the apples Newton has in his pocket after each action:

- Initially, Newton has 2 apples.
- After putting one in his pocket, he has 1 apple in his hand.
- After picking up 5 more apples, he has 1 + 5 = 6 apples in his hand.
- After putting 4 apples in his pocket, he has 1 apple in his hand.
- After picking up 6 more apples, he has 1 + 6 = 7 apples in his hand.

Adding the apples in his pocket and the one in his hand:

- Apples in his pocket: 1 (from the first action) + 4 (from the second action) = 5 apples.
- Apples in his hand: 7 apples.

Total apples Newton brought home:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the order:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, we get:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy \(\boxed{6}\) pizza pies."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

First, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since he ran 3 miles each of these days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. Since he ran 5 miles each of these days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 days:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to get the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[ 19 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes).

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In 1 hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, resulting in \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melting in 1 hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs but loses 8 snowballs due to melting.
   - Net rate of snowball accumulation = \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs per hour.

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs at a net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs needed}}{\text{Net rate of snowball accumulation}} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information provided.

1. We know that John is currently 28 years old.
2. We also know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.

Let's denote Jim's age when Digimon came out as \( J \) and John's age as \( 2J \) (since John was twice as old as Jim).

Since John is currently 28 years old, we need to find out how many years have passed since Digimon came out. Let's denote the number of years since Digimon came out as \( x \).

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ 28 = 2J + x \]
\[ J = J + x \]

From the first equation, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ x = 28 - 2J \]

Since \( J \) is Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( J + x \) is Jim's current age, we substitute \( x \) into the equation for Jim's current age:
\[ \text{Jim's current age} = J + (28 - 2J) = 28 - J \]

To find \( J \), we need to determine how many years have passed since Digimon came out. Since John is 28 and he was twice as old as Jim at the time, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2J + x \]
\[ 28 = 2J + (28 - 2J) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 28 = 28 \]

This confirms our setup. Now, we need to find \( J \):
\[ 28 = 2J + (28 - 2J) \]
\[ 28 = 28 \]

Since \( 28 = 2J + x \) and \( x = 28 - 2J \), we can solve for \( J \):
\[ 28 = 2J + (28 - 2J) \]
\[ 28 = 28 \]

This means:
\[ 28 = 2J + (28 - 2J) \]
\[ 28 = 28 \]

So, \( J = 14 \).

Now, we can find Jim's current age:
\[ \text{Jim's current age} = 28 - J = 28 - 14 = 14 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 14 years old.

14"
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with \(109 - 78 = 31\) bandages on the first day.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, calculate the cost of the haircut. The difference in hair length is 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches. The cost per inch of the haircut is $30, so the cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum up all the amounts.

3. For taking the trash to the curb: \(2 \times \$0.75 = \$1.50\)
4. For cleaning his room: \(1 \times \$1.50 = \$1.50\)

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
\$3.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.50 + \$1.50 = \$9.00
\]

So, Jason earned a total of \$9.00 in a two-week period."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks as follows:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

1. Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
   \]

2. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each:
   \[
   3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of eyeshadow colors:
   \[
   8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
   \]

Next, let's account for the colors stolen and used:

1. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors:
   \[
   26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors}
   \]

2. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors used}
   \]

3. Subtracting the used colors from the remaining total:
   \[
   22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \).
2. Height of the first floor: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \).

Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor is 180 inches high, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor height from the total height of the house:

3. Height of the second floor: \( 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \).

The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

Final numerical answer:
240 inches"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is:

"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Last tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, he changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, it is already over capacity with 270 people on board. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 0, as the bus is already at full capacity and over.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made to the museum over the 8 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she made:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

For the next 3 years, she continued to visit 3 times a year:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

So, the total number of visits over 8 years is:
\[ 15 \text{ visits} + 9 \text{ visits} = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The initial cost of one visit is $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars} + (150\% \times 2 \text{ dollars}) = 2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on all 24 visits at the new cost of $5 per visit:
\[ 24 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each wooden table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost for wooden tables: $80
- Total cost for roof frames: $20
- Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price after the 80% increase in December:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - An 80% increase means the price is multiplied by 1.80 (since 100% + 80% = 180% = 1.80).
   - New price in December = $40 * 1.80 = $72.

2. **Calculate the price after the 50% decrease in January:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - A 50% decrease means the price is multiplied by 0.50 (since 100% - 50% = 50% = 0.50).
   - New price in January = $72 * 0.50 = $36.

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many quizzes Sally took.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the total sum of the scores by the number of quizzes.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sum all the scores**:
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]
   Adding these together:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

2. **Count the number of scores**: Sally took 9 quizzes.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9} = 70

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the problem using the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[
9 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

So, \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. Assuming he drives for 24 hours each day (excluding stops), the distance he covers each day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes at the beginning by adding the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School.
2. Subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers to the remaining number of teachers.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School: 82
2. Number of sick teachers: 13
3. Number of substitute teachers: 9

First, subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, add the number of substitute teachers to the remaining number of teachers:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for one batch of macaroni and cheese:

1. **Pasta cost**: $1.00 per box
2. **Cheddar cheese cost**: $3.00
3. **Gruyere cheese cost**: Twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\)

Now, let's add up the total cost for one batch:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), the total cost is:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends \(\boxed{520.00}\) dollars on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe.

To find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) and the total time available in a day (480 minutes):

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

However, this calculation assumes the custodian works continuously without breaks, which is not realistic. Given the 5-day timeframe, the custodian spends:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has 3 shelves (one top, one middle, and one bottom), the total capacity is:
\[ 10 \text{ (top)} + 10 \text{ (middle)} + 20 \text{ (bottom)} = 40 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{40} = 2.75 \]

Since Elly cannot use a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Rose will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[
\text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price of a bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, which is \(70 + 40 = 110\).

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in total, we calculate 70% of 110:
\[
0.70 \times 110 = 77
\]
So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we determine how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
\[
0.60 \times 70 = 42
\]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To find out how many questions she needs to get correct on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got correct on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get correct:
\[
77 - 42 = 35
\]
Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the information provided:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (personal flashlights)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (flashlights for rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20
     \]

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in total.
   - Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (rooms with small candles)} \times 4 \text{ (candles per room)} + 4 \text{ (rooms with medium candles)} \times 5 \text{ (candles per room)} = 16 + 20 = 36

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes John 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since the problem states that once you get the fifth side, you have all 6 sides, we can assume the sixth side takes the same time as the fifth side, which is 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes

Adding these times together:

\[5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. **Number of Helmets**: 20
2. **Number of Robots**: Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
3. **Number of Footballs**: Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, we sum up all the items:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"First, let's calculate how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

   - Total water needed: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water needed per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water needed: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total number of plants: 20
   - Number of plants needing half a cup and 1 cup: \(4 + 8 = 12\)
   - Number of plants needing a quarter of a cup: \(20 - 12 = 8\)
   - Water needed per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water needed: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time spent hopping on land and the time spent swimming in water, then sum these times.

1. **Total Distance**: Phineas is 200 yards away from his home. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the distance on land is \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards, and the distance in water is also \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards.

2. **Time on Land**: Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time spent hopping 100 yards is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time in Water**: Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time spent swimming 100 yards is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The cost of the main phone is given as $20.
2. Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone. Therefore, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.
3. There are four additional phones, so the total cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
4. The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made daily.
2. Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made daily.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made daily is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.**

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing per week:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost per week:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00 per week

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 per week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes can be found using the formula:

\[ t = \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{words per minute}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \]

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 \]

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade.

1. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the main 4 gallons:**
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - For 4 gallons, the total lemon juice needed is \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups}\).

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon:**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, so it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the extra gallon needs \(2 \text{ cups}\).

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon
   - Total lemon juice = \(4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - For 6 cups of juice, the number of lemons required is \(6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons}\).

Therefore, Tim will need \(\boxed{36}\) lemons."

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent at the mall.

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so for two tickets: \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount given by her parents:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has \(\boxed{13}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

Therefore, Josh makes \(\$120\) in 2 weeks."

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, 6 toy soldiers will be sold at $5 each, and the other 6 toy soldiers will be sold at $7 each.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

We need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the actual number of test tubes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   - Therefore, Igor gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Determine the actual number of Petri dishes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   - Therefore, Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor lost some beakers on the way, so the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is \( x \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:**
   - The total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes.
   - According to the problem, the total number of items is 29.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29

"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second basket, then the second basket contains \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs.

Adding the eggs from both baskets together: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half as far as Vanessa, Aaron ran:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, Aaron's speed is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the time she took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

First, the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line he already has from the total amount needed:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy a total of:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night's reservations.

- Each meal costs $5, and they order 2 meals per reservation.
- Therefore, the cost of meals per reservation is \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
- So, the total cost per reservation is \( \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one night with 6 reservations:
- The total cost for one night is \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\).

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we calculate the weekly cost:
- The total cost for 2 days is \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\$180
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's work} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
