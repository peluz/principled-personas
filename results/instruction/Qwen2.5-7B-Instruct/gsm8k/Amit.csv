"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market every day is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increased by 1.5 times the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:

\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
540 meters"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total daily)} - 40 \text{ cups (morning and afternoon)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one at $3.

For each pair:
- Cost of the first glass = $5
- Cost of the second glass = $3

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 such pairs:
Total cost = 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse based on the information provided.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20 sheep
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

**Total number of sheep**: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes to download 80 GB.

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it takes \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes to download 120 GB.

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download 80 GB: 40 minutes
   - Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes
   - Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from his home.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since he has 4 hours total and spent 2.5 hours so far) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance in first leg + Distance in return journey = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home and then returned 15 miles, he is 165 miles from the point where he turned around.
   - He then drove an additional 120 miles, which means he is 165 miles + 120 miles = 285 miles from home.

**Final Answer:**
John is 285 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. **Regular Hours (First 40 hours):**

2. **Overtime Hours (Hours beyond 40):**
   - Overtime hours: \(45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}\)
   - Overtime rate: \(1.2 \times \$10 = \$12\) per hour
   - Total for overtime hours: \(5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60\)

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
   - Total earnings = \$400 + \$60 = \$460

Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after the initial cost:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Recover Initial Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. After selling to the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there.
5. After selling to the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

So, the equation representing the situation after selling to the orange house is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after accounting for contemporary and jazz dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125 at the end of the month.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.

If she makes 3 egg omelets every day, then in 28 days, she will have made \(3 \times 28 = 84\) eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is \(84 \div 12 = 7\) dozens.

**Final Answer: 7 dozens**"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the difference between Samantha's current age and the age of Raymond's son when he was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years before Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16.00}\) on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 45th mile (since 60 - 15 = 45).

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the mile he stopped at the second time and the mile he stopped at the first time:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages based on the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average.

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3:

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on walking and taking care of the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week to get the weekly hours.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us two equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes
Total points = 4 points + 5 points
Total points = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total money from selling lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $5 left, this confirms the calculation is correct. The question asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3S \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much on the other two days, so each of these days he runs \( \frac{3S}{2} \) miles.
   - Distance on the second day = \( \frac{3S}{2} \) miles.
   - Distance on the third day = \( \frac{3S}{2} \) miles.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day + Distance on the third day
   - Total distance = \( 3S + \frac{3S}{2} + \frac{3S}{2} \)
   - Total distance = \( 3S + 3S \)
   - Total distance = \( 6S \) miles.

4. **Given total distance:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.
   - Therefore, \( 6S = 60 \).

5. **Solving for \( S \):**
   - \( S = \frac{60}{6} \)
   - \( S = 10 \) miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed = 3 miles per hour.
- Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.

So, running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Next, we know that walking speed is one-fourth of running speed because she can run four times faster than she can walk.

So, walking speed = running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.
Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.

Next, we calculate the distance covered during each activity.

Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled in six hours.

Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles."
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \, \text{calories/serving} \times 5 \, \text{servings} = 1250 \, \text{calories} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 \, \text{calories} - 1800 \, \text{calories} = 200 \, \text{calories} \).

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - The entire bag (300g) contains 1250 calories.
   - To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{300 \, \text{g}}{1250 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{g}}{200 \, \text{calories}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300 \, \text{g} \times 200 \, \text{calories}}{1250 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \, \text{g}
     \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days: 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the remaining Post-it notes she had after work: 23.
4. The result will be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Remaining Post-it notes: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} \]

\[ -140 + 23 = -117 \]

Since the negative value doesn't make sense in this context, we need to correct the order of operations. The correct equation should be:

\[ 80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

Let's solve for the number of Post-it notes in the package:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 220 + 23 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is 4 feet long, which is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To calculate the revenue for each day, we need to multiply the number of tires repaired by the respective rate for each type of tire.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. 

Trixie has had 12 kittens. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from the house cats:

\[7 + 12 + 21 = 40\]

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining.

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the available weight for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, we divide the available weight by the weight of each box:

"To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total.

1. Total oranges = 25
2. Bad oranges = 1
3. Unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
4. Sour oranges = 2

Now, let's subtract these from the total:

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)
Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Good oranges = 25 - 8
Good oranges = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"Janet first spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to construct the brooch. The total cost for these items is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full 12-gallon tank of gas.

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days.
- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

So, the total number of classes in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} + 8 \text{ classes} = 25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students in a week is:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7,425.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7,425.00 \]"
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

To prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read the instructions for both recipes, which totals to \(20 + 40 = 60\) instructions.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since this total amount is to be paid over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Level 4: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days of the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond and David do based on the given relationships.

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then David does:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then Raymond does:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Savings = Cost of buying in packages of 2 - Cost of buying in packages of 3
- Savings = $9.00 - $15.00 = -$6.00 (This negative value indicates that buying in packages of 2 is more expensive, so we need to re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are comparing the better price correctly.)

Upon re-evaluation, it's clear that the better price is buying in packages of 3, as it costs less. Therefore, the correct calculation for savings is:
- Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.
Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses.
So, the total number of roses = 3 rose bushes * 25 roses per bush = 75 roses.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.
Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns = 75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

1. The first alarm rang 4 times.
2. The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third alarm rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add the number of rings from each alarm:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary after each of the next three years, given the 10% annual increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for 5 years.

The formula to calculate the salary after a certain number of years with a fixed percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Final Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial salary is $600, the increase rate is 10% (or 0.10), and the number of years is 5.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 966.306 \]

So, after 5 years, her monthly salary is approximately $966.31.

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after each of the next three years.**

Now, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years, with a 10% increase each year.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 966.31 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 1062.941 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1062.941 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1169.2351 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1169.2351 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1286.15861 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, her annual salary after three more years of service is approximately $1286.16.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{1286.16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ friends don't show up} \]

Therefore, the number of friends who are expected to attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ friends} \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ gift bags} \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. **Adult Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**

"To find out how old Jackson is, let's use the information given:

1. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10% of his original time. We can calculate the reduction in time as:

\[ \text{Reduction in time} = 10\% \times \text{Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald's new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Reduction in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Total students = 200

Number of boys = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80\)

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80\)

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Now, solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has before receiving the new ones is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. So, the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these numbers.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, which totals 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks \(3 \times 5 = 15\) glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and has a soda with dinner instead of water. This means he drinks 2 glasses of water per day on Saturday and Sunday (breakfast and lunch). So, for the weekend, he drinks \(2 \times 2 = 4\) glasses of water.

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together, John drinks \(15 + 4 = 19\) glasses of water in a week.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given to set up a proportion.

Given:
- The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
- The city is 42 miles across.

First, we find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/10 minutes}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 5.5 \, \text{hours}\)

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 \, \text{hours} - 5.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \, \text{hours} \div 0.5 \, \text{hours/episode} = 3 \, \text{episodes}\)

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many, so he aimed to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year."

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Final cost after cashback
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

The final cost of the gas after the cashback reward is \$28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups that both Marcell and Beatrice had:
- Total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \).

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

To find the total distance to the shore, we use the total time and the rate:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we use the total distance and the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = \left(\frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16 \text{ liters}} \]"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Each lesson uses the whiteboard.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is also 50% higher than the original price of $16:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \$90."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

Solving for x:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, which totals to 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. 

To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles:

30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 (vehicles added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container to find the number of containers added:

20 (vehicles added) / 5 (vehicles per container) = 4 (containers added on the second day)

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper a week.

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they brought:

For Morisette:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits} \]

For Kael:
\[ 10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits} \]

Adding the fruits together:
\[ 13 \text{ fruits} + 14 \text{ fruits} = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is:

"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 46 hours

"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the distance covered in the next 4 hours is:

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, the number of letters she stamps is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and she added 20 letters to this pile, then the original number of letters in the already-stamped pile was:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, when Jennie began, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Total amount of money he will spend:**
$880."
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.**

- Number of patients per day: 500
- Average time per patient: 24 minutes

Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Convert minutes to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from patients.**

- Charge per hour from patients: $200
- Total hours of patient visits: 200 hours

Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.**

- Charge per hour to the hospital: $150
- Total hours of doctor visits: 200 hours

Total cost to the hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost to the hospital
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

Questions completed in the first test = Rate × Time available
= 5 questions/hour × 8 hours
= 40 questions

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Questions completed in the second test = Rate × Time available

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \(W = 2B\)
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \(B = 2Q\)

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[W + B + Q = 700\]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700\]

Combining like terms:
\[\frac{4B + 2B + B}{2} = 700\]
\[\frac{7B}{2} = 700\]

Solving for B:
\[7B = 1400\]
\[B = 200\]

Now, using the relationship \(W = 2B\):
\[W = 2 \times 200 = 400\]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\$140\) in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items after tax:
Total cost = 5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food after tax) = 16 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of everything is 16 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

Finally, we calculate the profit:

- Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
- Therefore, the profit is \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest = 100 pineapples/hectare

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year = Pineapples per hectare per harvest × Number of hectares × Number of harvests in a year
= 100 pineapples/hectare × 10 hectares × 4 harvests
= 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return. That means 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees return.

So, in the last 6 hours, Debra sees 90 bees return to the hive.

90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Change} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \$22 = \$8 \]

To find the amount given, we add $22 to $8:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
\[ 3D = 12 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
- \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the change Carl receives is $4.00."
"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since ants carried off 1 fry).
3. **Before the raccoon took two-thirds**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon took them as \( x \). The raccoon took two-thirds, leaving one-third, so \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 18 \).
4. **Before the pigeons ate**: The pigeons each ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so \( y = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \). Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
6. **Before Dave ate 14 fries**: Dave ate 14 fries, so the original number of fries in the pack was \( 34 + 14 = 48 \).

Therefore, the number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was **48**."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

**Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
- 3 classes per day, each 1 hour long.
- Total for these 3 days: \(3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}\).

**Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
- 2 classes per day, each 2 hours long.
- Total for these 2 days: \(2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

**Total weekly hours:**
- Adding the hours from all days: \(9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\).

**Total semester hours:**
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer needs to be in feet, we'll convert the measurements of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length:

\( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

1. Cost of pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
2. Cost of notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
3. Cost of bond paper: $20

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total amount spent:

Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20
Total cost = $24

Raphael spent $24 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from hiding, and since they were already counted in the initial 11, we don't add them again. Instead, we consider that now he sees all 11 plus the 6 that were hiding, making it 17 tadpoles. However, then 2 of them hide under a rock, so we subtract those 2 from the total.

17 - 2 = 15

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10

- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, we add the total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, each increase adds $4 to the price. After 18 increases, the total increase in price is:

\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase:

\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Given that one red car costs $4 and an action figure costs $5, we can determine the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the doll's cost is:

- 5 red cars at $4 each: \( 5 \times \$4 = \$20 \)
- 3 action figures at $5 each: \( 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \)
- 1 doll at $15: \( \$15 \)

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:

\[ \$20 + \$15 + \$15 = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Cost of hiring the accountant:**
   The accountant charges $90.

2. **Lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work at a rate of $35 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Lost income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
   \]

3. **Comparison:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she spends $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in potential income.

4. **Net difference:**
   \[
   \text{Net difference} = \text{Lost income} - \text{Cost of accountant} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15
   \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102

Now, let's do the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423
4. €1423 + €74 = €1497
5. €1497 + €102 = €1599

The total cost of the items is €1599. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €99.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
€0

Since she is over her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Final numerical answer:

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend together gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80

\[640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- The age of the fourth bird (Caboose) is not given, so we assume it's the same as Sally Thirtytwo, which is 8 years old.

Adding these together:

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for both peeling and cutting each potato.

1. **Peeling Time**: It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is:
   \[
   1.5 \, \text{minutes/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 90 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

2. **Cutting Time**: It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is:
   \[
   5 \, \text{seconds/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 300 \, \text{seconds}
   \]
   Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
   \[
   300 \, \text{seconds} \div 60 = 5 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

3. **Total Time**: Adding the peeling and cutting times together:
   \[
   90 \, \text{minutes} + 5 \, \text{minutes} = 95 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

Next, we are told that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
   \[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
   \[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much he has left after these expenses.
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Next, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

So, the amount left after the donation is:
\[ \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid then gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
\[ \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the amount Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[ \text{Final amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is \(40 + 36 + 46 = 122\).

"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and that this number is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
4. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.
5. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
6. Since two years have passed, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
7. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

They both picked 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

4. **Straw used by rats:**
   - Total straw - Straw used by hamsters - Straw used by rabbits = Straw used by rats.
   - 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw used by rats.

5. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 90 / 6 = 15 rats.
   - Since these 15 rats are in 3 cages, the number of rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest compounded each month.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**After 1st Month**:
- Interest = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total Amount = $100 + $2 = $102

**After 2nd Month**:
- Interest = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total Amount = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**After 3rd Month**:
- Interest = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total Amount = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price per bag for the trader is $20 (purchase cost) + $2 (transport cost) = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The profit per bag is therefore $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit made by the trader is $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we can use the formula for total profit:

\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Profit per bag} \times \text{Number of bags} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 400 = 8 \times x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is \$12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese consumption for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches = 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

Let's denote the score Brinley needs on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the scores of the four highest tests is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score, the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) will be:
\[ 367 + x \]

Since she can remove the lowest score, the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score will be:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 367 + x = 93 \times 5 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let's say she needs to mow the lawn \(x\) times to earn enough money.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns $4x from mowing the lawn.

Including the money she already had saved, Sara's total amount of money is:
- $10 (initial savings) + $20 (from babysitting) + $4x (from mowing the lawn).

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age = 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age = 21 * 2 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age = 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna:

- Yuri's points: \( \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \)
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

The total points scored by these three students is:

\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total:

\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle. 

For the crossword puzzles:
- 3 crossword puzzles × 10 minutes per puzzle = 30 minutes

For the sudoku puzzles:
- 8 sudoku puzzles × 5 minutes per puzzle = 40 minutes

Adding the time spent on both activities:
- 30 minutes (crossword) + 40 minutes (sudoku) = 70 minutes

Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

For Carlos:
- The cost per hour for renting a canoe is $30.
- Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Carlos is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

For Benji:
- The cost per hour for renting a banana boat raft is $18.
- Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Benji is \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together:
- Total cost for Carlos and Benji is \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

The trip by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, so:
\[ \text{Car trip duration} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

If Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and returns by car, the total travel time will be:
\[ \text{Total travel time} = \text{Bus trip} + \text{Car trip} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:
9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

- Initial number of fire type cards: 30
- Initial number of grass type cards: 20
- Initial number of water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- New number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
- Total number of cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find the percentage, we multiply the probability by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
33%"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we need to add up the cost of each item he chose:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's sum these amounts:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract this from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces:**
   - Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
   - Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 / 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

   - Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.
   - At a combined rate of 6 pieces per minute, the time required to complete the puzzle is \(360 / 6 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, 60 minutes is equal to \(60 / 60 = 1\) hour.

**Final Answer:**
It will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find out how many were not ready to be harvested.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:**
   - Total watermelons = 120
   - Percentage ready for harvest = 30%
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 30% of 120 = 0.30 * 120 = 36

2. **Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons:**
   - Remaining watermelons after two months = Total watermelons - Watermelons ready for harvest
   - Remaining watermelons after two months = 120 - 36 = 84

3. **Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks:**
   - Fraction of remaining watermelons ready for harvest = 3/4
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks = 3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63

4. **Subtract the number of harvested watermelons after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find out how many were not ready to be harvested:**
   - Remaining watermelons after two weeks = Remaining watermelons after two months - Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks
   - Remaining watermelons after two weeks = 84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000
Total cost = $276,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for everything."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"There are 36 penguins initially sunbathing. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

First, calculate one-third of 36:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in and swim in the ocean, and another 12 penguins go inside the cave. 

Now, subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number:
\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
12

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again, and he can mix the ink from 5 of these to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated.

4. **Generalizing the Process**: Each time he refills, he can make 1 new pen from every 5 empty pens. We need to determine how many times he can repeat this process.

Let's calculate the total number of pens he can have:

- After the first cycle, he has 25 (initial) + 5 (new) = 30 pens.

"Johnny initially took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount of money he had was:

\[ \$20 + \$10 = \$30 \]

This sum of $30 was then invested, and it tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount of money he had after a year would be:

\[ \$30 \times 3 = \$90 \]

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can determine the ages of Joan and Mary as follows:

1. Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   - Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years.

2. Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls:
- Jessa's age = 20 years
- Joan's age = 25 years
- Mary's age = 23 years

Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
                  = 20 + 25 + 23
                  = 68 years

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total to find the number who went out through exit C.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many candies Robert has:**
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) candies.

2. **Determine how many candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.

3. **Calculate how many more candies John has than James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - Therefore, John has \( 54 - 33 = 21 \) more candies than James.

**Final numerical answer:**
John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by each person and avoid double-counting.

Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, which totals 3 books.
Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, which totals 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, we need to count each book only once, even if it is read by both. Therefore, the total number of books read is the sum of the unique books, which is 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

By the end, they will collectively read 3 books."
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, he receives 30 pages a week (3 people * 10 pages).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.

To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total time spent writing 30 pages.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for each item:
- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days is \(20 + 26 = 46\).

The total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days is \(5 + 13 = 18\).

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed is \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The total calories her sister consumed is \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

**5600**"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
   - The number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - The third class has 3 girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

61 - 9 = 52 apps

52 + 18 = 70 apps

Therefore, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 times the number of cougars, which is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:

- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

73 animals"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The target floor is calculated as 4 times his starting floor plus 6. So, we calculate it as follows:

Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so we subtract 9 from 30:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times. Now, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Adding these 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, each stall now has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows} \]

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

176"

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so they ate:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Total cookies = 36 cookies today + 30 cookies tomorrow = 66 cookies
2. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]

\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]

\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake 66 cookies."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200 \text{ pennies} \]

Since 100 pennies make a dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars:

\[ \frac{6,200}{100} = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

62 dollars"
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, the total number of marbles in the boxes is:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Then, she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

Therefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

Therefore, all three girls have a combined total of $400."
"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = $17,500

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
   - Transfer fee = $42,000

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
   - Total price = $409,500

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   - Budget = $400,000
   - Difference = Total price - Budget
   - Difference = $409,500 - $400,000
   - Difference = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

3. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Now, we subtract these amounts from the selling price to find the net proceeds.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Transfer Fees} - \text{Brokerage Fee} - \text{Remaining Loan Amount} \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 12,000 - 20,000 - 250,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 118,000 \]

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the additional heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- Cost per newspaper ad = $5
- Number of newspaper ads = 50
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- Cost per television ad = $75
- Number of television ads = 15
- Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads to find the overall expenditure:

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = bedroom windows + additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

3. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can now calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

4. Subtract the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

5. Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 765 stitches."

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song Lines:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene Lines:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene Lines:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song lines: 54
- First scene lines: 36
- Second scene lines: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize: \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

**Final Answer:**
138"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total cards**: 80

2. **Cards with the letter A**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 80
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
   \]
   So, 32 cards have the letter A.

3. **Remaining cards after removing those with A**: 
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48
   \]

4. **Cards with the letter B**: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining 48
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 cards have the letter B.

5. **Remaining cards after removing those with B**: 
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

6. **Cards with the letter C**: \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining 24
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 cards have the letter C.

7. **Remaining cards after removing those with C**: 
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9
   \]

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

**Final answer**: 9"
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for digging small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for digging large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

3. Add the total times for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so the total sum of their ages will increase by 20 years (10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 (their current sum of ages) + 20 (the additional years for both of them) = 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length available for the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads can fit into the 17 inches of space, we divide the available length by the length of one bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is currently twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is \(9 \times 2 = 18\) years old.

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtract the stars in the known rows from the total:
   - Total stars: 76
   - Stars in known rows: 36
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of one truck.

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine how many trucks are needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Together, Ali and Izzy have:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

The problem states that the total number of medals they have is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. So, if we let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out, we have:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 \]

\[ M = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 bars are to be shared equally among them:

1. **Determine the total time Susan works:**
   - She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. **Convert the working time into minutes:**
   - 2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 minutes = 150 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes:**
   - 150 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 15 intervals.

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval.

"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. **Mike's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 21 points
   - Extra point in the fourth round: Since Mike has over 20 points, he gets an extra point.
   - Total points for Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points

2. **Jim's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 3 points less than Mike, so 21 - 3 = 18 points
   - Extra point in the fourth round: Since Jim has 18 points, he does not get an extra point.
   - Total points for Jim: 18 points

3. **Tony's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 2 times more than Mike, so 21 * 2 = 42 points
   - Extra point in the fourth round: Since Tony has over 20 points, he gets an extra point.
   - Total points for Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household.
2. Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily consumption of rice.**
- Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
- Each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) per day.
- With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.**
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg} \times 7 = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**
- The 42 kg bag of rice will last \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.

Since there are 3 other people who each bid once, Carmen will bid 3 times after them. Therefore, the bids will be as follows:

- First bid (after the opening bid): $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:

$250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $900

Therefore, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is $900."

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid:
- The first fold will print 4 pages (1, 2 on the front, and 31, 32 on the back).
- The second fold will print another 4 pages (3, 4 on the front, and 29, 30 on the back).

Since 32 pages require 8 pages of paper to be folded and printed in this manner (each piece of paper can print 4 pages), the number of pieces of paper used is:

\[
\frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
\]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid."

Therefore, the amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks, Sandy would need twice the time since he takes 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, Sandy will need 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

8 weeks"

   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

After fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \]

years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"Given that Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah was 20 years old six years ago.

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

If the population of Chile was half what it is now six years ago, then the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually show up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles, Solomon bought 20 more, and his father gave him 8 more. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
156 \text{ kgs}
\]"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of electric wires:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

**Final numerical answer:**
8 women are left at the party."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for the pencils in Jam's boxes as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils Jam has} + \text{Pencils Meg has} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since we know that Jam's boxes can hold 24 pencils each, we can use this information to find out how many boxes are needed in total.

First, we calculate how many full boxes are needed for 72 pencils:
\[ \text{Number of full boxes} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Since 72 pencils can be perfectly divided into 3 boxes of 24 pencils each, we do not need any additional loose pencils. Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is 3.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total cooling effect and the corresponding weakening of the coffee.

First, we know that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees. We can find out how many ice cubes she used by dividing the total cooling by the cooling effect of one ice cube:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

4. We are given that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). Adding these to the remaining lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

If Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have:

17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

**Erin has 14 lollipops left.**"
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total discount from the rewards and the coupon is:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this discount from the $43 spent:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid:

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A)."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we find 40% of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (the other one) has 5 guns. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Richard, and Jason), so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many each would have if shared equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns if they shared their guns equally.

6"
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break it down as follows:

- For 8 batches of suckers: \(8 \times 30 \text{ ounces} = 240 \text{ ounces}\)
- For 1 batch of fudge: \(1 \times 70 \text{ ounces} = 70 \text{ ounces}\)

Adding these together gives us the total amount of sugar needed:

\(240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces}\)

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Therefore, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

The final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times C + 2 \times H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs."
"Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, by the end of the fourth week, he would be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, he drops 3 balls during the performance. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

But 2 of those dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 (remaining balls) - 2 (caught balls) = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits from her friend. At her baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 24 * 2 = 48 baby outfits. Her mom then gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. 

To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we add all these amounts together:

24 (from her friend) + 48 (from her baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87 baby outfits.

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (assuming June has 30 days).

First, let's find out the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than his current daily distance of 5000 meters.

\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day after following the coach's advice is:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, to find out the total distance Tyson runs in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June (30 days):

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]"

160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, that's:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, that's:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, to find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies taken by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in a bag:

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

$60 - $24 = $36

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.**
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.**
- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue.**
- Difference in daily revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
- Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**
- Percentage increase = (Difference in daily revenue / Original daily revenue) * 100%
- Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%.

The factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, let's break down each activity and calculate the time spent on each:

1. **Monday's Yoga Class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's Cooking Class**: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Wednesday's Cheese-Tasting Event**: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
4. **Thursday's Museum Tour**: Half as long as the cooking class, so \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours
5. **Friday's Errands**: 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

\[1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 8 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is 8 hours."
"April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. For the roses, she needs twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots.

Therefore, the number of plant pots left over is 100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10 plant pots.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

1. Andrea had $36 initially.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, subtract this total from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought:

- Cost of 6 toy cars: \(6 \times \$2 = \$12\)
- Cost of 5 teddy bears: \(5 \times \$1 = \$5\)

Total cost of items: \(\$12 + \$5 = \$17\)

Dean started with $28 and spent $17, so the money left after his purchases is:

\(\$28 - \$17 = \$11\)

Then, his mother gives him an extra $10:

\(\$11 + \$10 = \$21\)

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\(\$21\)"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's denote the number of friends Morgan can invite as \( f \). The total cost for Morgan and her friends would be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 30 + 30f \]

Morgan's budget is $90, so we set up the equation:

\[ 30 + 30f = 90 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( f \):

\[ 30f = 60 \]

Divide both sides by 30 to solve for \( f \):

\[ f = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, so the total cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - After buying gumballs, he spent $2.00.
   - Change before buying gumballs = $10 - $2.00 = $8.00.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before spending on gumballs:**
   - Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs.
   - Therefore, the amount he had before spending on gumballs = $8.00 * 2 = $16.00.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on candy:**
   - Total money Billy had initially = $10.
   - Money spent on gumballs = $2.00.
   - Money spent on candy = $16.00 - $2.00 = $14.00.

5. **Determine the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $14.00 / $1.5 per pound = 14 / 1.5 = 9.3333 pounds.

Since the amount of candy is typically measured in whole or half pounds in such problems, we can round to the nearest practical value, but the exact answer based on the given data is:

Billy bought **9.3333 pounds** of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add these distances to find the total distance for one trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the minimum requirement of 42 points.

Points from the first test: 15
Points from the second test: 18

Total points from the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, we subtract the points she already has from the total required points:

42 - 33 = 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If Sara has 8 points, then three times Sara's points would be:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin now has 24 points. Since Erin scored 14 points to reach this total, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching for all picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total cost for etching = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,208.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,208."
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper.

The total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper would be the original price minus the savings:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Number of Months}}{12}\right) \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit per hour:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

**David's Cost:**
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

**Dasha's Cost:**
- Dasha buys tickets for each ride. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, her total cost is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

**Total Cost for Both:**
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- Combined total cost: \(30 + 36 = $66\)

**David's Savings:**
- If Dasha had bought a ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets, her cost would have been $30.
- The difference in cost between Dasha buying individual tickets and a bracelet is \(36 - 30 = $6\).
- Since David bought the bracelet, he saves the $6 that Dasha would have spent on individual tickets.

Therefore, David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount:

The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. 

The time spent editing is given as 90 minutes. We need to convert this to hours to make the units consistent. \(90 \text{ minutes} = 90 \div 60 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

   \[72 + 20 = 92\]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

The net change in the number of cards she has is the number of cards she received minus the number of cards she gave away, which is \(17 - 29 = -12\).

Therefore, the total number of cards Erica now has is \(50 - 29 - 12 = 9\).

"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, Mark gets:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices given away or eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

"First, let's calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner before and after the reduction in usage.

Before the reduction:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
- It is used for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts/day.

After the reduction:
- The air conditioner is used for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.
- Therefore, daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts/day.

The energy saved per day is:
- 7200 watts/day - 2700 watts/day = 4500 watts/day.

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the energy saved per day in kilowatts is:
- 4500 watts/day / 1000 = 4.5 kW/day.

Over 30 days, the total energy saved is:
- 4.5 kW/day * 30 days = 135 kW.

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, let's calculate the total steps he had completed before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, the total steps he aimed to take (10,000) minus the steps he had left (2,000) gives us the steps he took during his jog:
- Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
\[ 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
\[ 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000 \]

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Payment for May + Payment for June

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles:

1. First, calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.01 = 500 \text{ candles} \]

2. Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. However, the problem does not specify how many of the total candles are considered ""more dangerous."" Assuming that the 5% defect applies to the 1% that might explode, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode:
\[ 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \text{ candles} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode is 25."
"First, we need to calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

The discount amount per blouse is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

Solving for \(x\):

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \) by substituting \( C \) back into the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
- He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- Total distance in the first 4 days = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the next 2 days:
- He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
- Distance in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the second week:
- He traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
- Total distance in the second week = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Finally, let's sum up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:
- Total distance = Distance in the first 4 days + Distance in the next 2 days + Distance on the next day + Distance in the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Elevation difference = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Elevation difference = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

**Total cost for 2 years of the service:**
\[
\$284

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans. He saved 1/3 of this total from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means he saved $2 on the jogger jeans. Since the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans before the sale was:

\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. Therefore, the difference is:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   - Total capacity of buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   - Total capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   - Total capacity of minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip.

- Total capacity = 240 (buses) + 180 (minibusses) + 150 (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
- She buys 3 bird feeders.
- Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders:

- The 3 store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
- The 3 homemade feeders attract 30 birds each, so 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:

60 (from store-bought feeders) + 90 (from homemade feeders) = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Bagel Cost**: The bagel costs $4.

2. **Soup Cost**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel.
   - 25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
   - Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

3. **Cake Cost**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner.
- Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
- Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11

Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

First, we need to determine how much money Kenny made from selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and needs $100 for the ticket, he must have made $50 from selling the cards.

Next, we calculate how many cards he sold to make $50. Since each card is sold for $1.5, the number of cards sold is:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{50 \times 2}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and he can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards (as selling 33 cards would give him $49.5, which is the closest to $50 without exceeding it).

Now, we know that the 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection because he keeps 1/3 and sells 2/3. Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with. Then:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 49.5 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and the problem context suggests a practical scenario where fractional cards aren't sold, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 50.

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. Therefore, 18 guests would have 2 hot dogs each, which means 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs were prepared for these guests.

2. **Remaining Hot Dogs**: Since 36 hot dogs were prepared for the 18 guests, and there were no additional hot dogs prepared for the other half, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

3. **Actual Guests**: 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means each of the 40 guests would want 2 hot dogs in total.

4. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: For 40 guests to each have 2 hot dogs, a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs would be needed.

5. **Shortage Calculation**: Since only 36 hot dogs were prepared, the shortage is 80 - 36 = 44 hot dogs.

6. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs, and only 36 hot dogs were available, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is the shortage divided by 1 (since each additional hot dog is for one guest), which is 44.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 44."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to the 3 letters: 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total to find the final cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (total money Dora has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more."

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces are eaten. Since the cake was divided equally into 8 pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, he should leave 4 minutes before the premiere starts. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time, which means she should leave \(4 + 5 = 9\) minutes before the premiere starts.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98 \text{ feet}} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth's total is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Margareth's total is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.**

- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each on Monday. So, the revenue from these sales is:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

- The remaining sneakers are \(48 - 17 = 31\). These were sold at $25 each. So, the revenue from these sales is:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

- The total revenue from all sales is:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( ($15 + P) - $21 = $2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( $15 + P - $21 = $2 \)
   - \( P - $6 = $2 \)
   - \( P = $2 + $6 \)
   - \( P = $8 \)

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.60 * 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies, join the group. So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's final cost from Kelly's final cost:

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate Luri's songs as follows:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can still add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs **4 bags** of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

Next, we find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures of each country and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Sum of the highest temperatures:
-48 + 21 - 3 = -30°F

Now, we divide this sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ \$12 - \$4 = \$8 \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ \frac{\$8}{\$2 \text{ per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only pays for one pack when she buys two. So, the cost for 2 packs is effectively the cost of 1 pack:

- Cost for 2 packs with the sale = $4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon:

- Cost after coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Heather is buying 2 packs, which contain 4 razors each, so she is getting 8 razors in total:

- Total number of razors = 4 razors/pack * 2 packs = 8 razors.

The cost per razor is:

- Cost per razor = Total cost after discount / Total number of razors
- Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Converting this to cents:

- Cost per razor in cents = $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Therefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the pyramid, with the shortest cheerleader at the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders
- Middle layer: 3 cheerleaders
- Top layer: 2 cheerleaders
- Topmost layer: 1 cheerleader (the shortest one, who is 60"" tall)

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, the 10th (shortest) cheerleader is 60"" tall. We can assume the other cheerleaders are all 64"" tall.

Let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:

1. Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders): \(4 \times 64"" = 256""\)
2. Middle layer (3 cheerleaders): \(3 \times 64"" = 192""\)
3. Top layer (2 cheerleaders): \(2 \times 64"" = 128""\)
4. Topmost layer (1 cheerleader): \(60""\)

Adding these together gives the total height of the pyramid in inches:
\[256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""\]

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636"" \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett's current age is 14, three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42.

Therefore, Angela is currently \(42 - 4 = 38\) years old.

Angela is 38 years old right now."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, the total amount spent is:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn, so she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the amounts used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Gifts for the first 2 friends**: Each of these 2 friends wants 5 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 2 friends = 2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

2. **Gifts for the next 3 friends**: Each of these 3 friends wants 2 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 3 friends = 3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

3. **Additional random gifts**: Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.
   - Additional gifts = 10 gifts

Now, let's add all these together to find the total number of gifts:

- Total gifts = Gifts for the first 2 friends + Gifts for the next 3 friends + Additional random gifts
- Total gifts = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26

**Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.**"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Final numerical answer:
1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for the week without a pass would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost of her bus trips for the week would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 1, if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo should have half as many cows, which is not directly relevant to the number of sheep and cows we are given.

From point 2, if the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm should have half as many sheep, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's sum up the animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep + (the number of cows, which is not specified but not needed for the final count) = 20 sheep (since the number of cows in the zoo is not given and not needed for the final count).

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is:

40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

60 animals"
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Total onions and potatoes Sophia bought: 4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to burn**

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit**

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, the total distance is:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, for 2 km, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying clothes:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying CDs:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, at $4 per pack. So, the total cost is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4 \text{ per pack} = \$32 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each of the 40 bags (8 packs \(\times\) 5 bags per pack) for $8 each. So, the total revenue is:

\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times \$8 \text{ per bag} = \$320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$320 - \$32 = \$288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

\[ \$288 \]"

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount is calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, Ali gives half of this amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."

For one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild: \(2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19\) skeins

Since she is making these for three grandchildren, we multiply the total by 3:
\(19 \times 3 = 57\) skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   \[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he completes:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
   The remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   \[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completes:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulip and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for both colors of tulips:
- Total rows = rows of red tulips + rows of blue tulips

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make **12 batches** of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$504."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 10 days is double the time to paint half a house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the same house. Since 5 people are working together, their combined rate is 5 times that of one person.

The time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house can be calculated by dividing the total work (1 whole house) by the combined rate of the 5 people. The combined rate of 5 people is 5 times the rate of one person, so it would take them 10 days / 5 = 2 days to paint a whole house.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set.

Given:
- Cost of one CD = $4
- Total amount paid = $48

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can calculate the number of CDs he could buy with $48 by dividing $48 by the cost of one CD:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours he has spent working out is \(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours.

Total number of hours spent working out across the 8 weeks: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[55 - 8 = 47\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:

\[47 - 22 = 25\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2M \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the monitors} + \text{Cost of the printer} = $2,400 \]
\[ $1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ $1,800 + 2M = $2,400 \]

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to solve for \( 2M \):

\[ 2M = $2,400 - $1,800 \]
\[ 2M = $600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

\[ M = \frac{$600}{2} \]
\[ M = $300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To determine how much you ended up paying, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of the base bill.
   - 20% of $50 is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \).

2. **Add the tip to the base bill:**
   - Total bill = Base bill + Tip
   - Total bill = $50 + $10 = $60.

3. **Determine your share of the bill:**
   - Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the base bill, you are paying 120% of the base bill.
   - 120% of $50 is \( 1.20 \times 50 = 60 \).

So, you end up paying $60."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, the sum of the savings from both halves of the month should equal $1125:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at 32 degrees from the ground, and moves 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since each son needs a candle for each year of their age, we add the ages of both sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time by the reading rate:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks."
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

5 sandwiches are left."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63.

Now, to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days from Sunday to Wednesday, we can divide his total money by 7 and then multiply by 4 to find out how much he spends on wooden action figures.

Total money = $70
Days from Sunday to Wednesday = 4

Amount spent on wooden action figures = (70 / 7) * 4 = $40

Now, we know each wooden action figure costs $5, so the number of wooden action figures he can buy is:

Number of wooden action figures = 40 / 5 = 8

Next, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures:

Money left = 70 - 40 = $30

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

Number of plastic action figures = 30 / 2 = 15

So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

Total action figures = 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23

Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 23 action figures."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up the costs of spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The total cost so far is $308."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is 4% too hot.

Now, we need to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe. If the oven is 4% too hot, we need to set it to a temperature that, when 4% is added, equals 520 degrees. Let's denote the correct setting as \( x \).

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times \$76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \$129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is \(12 + 40 = 52\).

The total number of dishes brought by both is \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils (cups + dishes) brought by the two is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is $1.00. However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since the number of contacts per box is 90, and we are buying 2 boxes, we have 180 contacts, which is 90 pairs. Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:

- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for both John and Jill.

Earnings per hour = $10

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:

$70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: The protein content per gram of mushrooms is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \).

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. So, the daily protein intake is \( 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \).

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, \( 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, it's:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle, which is three times the smallest angle, is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in nickels, dimes, quarters, and pennies.

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel, and a nickel is worth $0.05, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, so the final weight he uses is:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has **104 games**."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours:

For Ruiz:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolates they made together:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   - He spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   - He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars on Wednesday.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Total amount spent over the three days is \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

5. **Initial Amount:**
   - Howard originally had $100.

6. **Remaining Amount:**
   - Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount is \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the different rates and times of sales.

1. For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
   - Total cups sold in the first four hours: \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}\)
   - Total earnings from the first four hours: \(60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30\)

2. For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
   - Total cups sold in the next two hours: \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}\)
   - Total earnings from the next two hours: \(20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12\)

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to get the total earnings:
- Total earnings: \(\$30 + \$12 = \$42\)

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced after **6 years**."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per bottle.
2. Determine the number of pumps used per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of washings per bottle is 120.

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then the number of pumps used per washing is 1.

The cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps used for 120 washings. Since 2 pumps are used for 120 washings, the total number of pumps used is 2 * 120 = 240 pumps.

Now, we calculate the cost per pump:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{240 \text{ pumps}} = \$0.10 \text{ per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
\[ \$0.10 = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

Therefore, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts. So, the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a typo and he can only buy one item, we'll calculate the remaining money for the shirt.

The cost of the shirt after discount is $17.50. So, the remaining money Joe will have after buying the shirt is:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

Since the question asks for the final numerical answer, the money Joe will have left after the purchase (assuming he buys the shirt) is:
\[ \boxed{32.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Total cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is $65,960."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - Therefore, the research takes 50 - 5 = 45 months after the initial 5 months.
   - Each of these 45 months costs 50% more than the previous month.
   - The cost for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
   - The cost for the 7th month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.
   - This pattern continues, with each month's cost being 1.5 times the previous month's cost.

The cost for each month forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \(n = 45\), \(a = 150,000\), and \(r = 1.5\).

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.5^{45}\). Using a calculator:
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,148,698.13 \]

So,
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,148,698.13 - 1) \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,148,697.13 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 344,609,139,000 \]

Adding the initial 5 months' cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 344,609,139,000 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 344,609,139,100 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately $344,609,139,100."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the number of days in March and the average number of posts per member per day.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

So, the total number of posts per member in March is:
3 posts/day * 31 days = 93 posts/member

Since there are 1000 members in the group, the total number of posts for the group in March is:
93 posts/member * 1000 members = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:
93,000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

If a gallon of water costs $0.15, then for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat from the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat from the bull is 750kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

After the administrators have taken their seats, the remaining seats are:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]"

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.

First, let's find the total number of hours:

- John went to physical therapy twice a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- The total number of hours is 24.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[

\[ 160 \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, so for those three days, it towed:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, it towed four fewer cars each day than the first three days, which means it towed:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
So for the remaining four days, it towed:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the cars towed over the entire week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:
54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Now, calculate the height difference:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

4 years"
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \text{James made} = 17,500 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. So, we calculate the number of men who can stay upright as follows:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ men} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel, which is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
4800
\]"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck Stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would still allow the cost per class to be $10 or less.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes = $60
- Cost per class should not exceed $10

Let's calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend for the cost to be $10 per class or less. If the cost per class is $10, then for 10 classes, the total cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ classes} \times \$10/\text{class} = \$100 \]

However, Manny's actual total cost is $60. We need to find out how many classes he can miss so that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Let's denote the number of classes he can attend as \( x \). The cost per class would then be:
\[ \frac{60}{x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10x \]
\[ x \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can attend at least 6 classes for the cost per class to be $10 or less. Since there are 10 classes in total, the number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes per day:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:**
   - Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of customers processed in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, in a week, they process \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. 

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if Reggie ran 20 miles, Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$21000 = \$10500 \]

So, Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$21000 + \$10500 = \$31500 \]

To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$31500 \times 12 = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378000\) in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

Now, we sum up the total costs:
- Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
- Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $10800."

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:

Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add these times together.

1. **Time to dig through soil:**
   - Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

2. **Time to dig through clay:**
   - Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so his speed through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
   - He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount for 20 pomegranates was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of red and green hat sales, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * (3/4) = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the first month's sales and the second month's sales, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is $2100."

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rent**: $5000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for the hanger and fuel for the year is:
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost for Hanger and Fuel} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the annual cost for the hanger and fuel gives us the total cost for the first year:

"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R)**: 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P)**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, \(P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans (B)**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \(B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\) minutes.

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00. So, the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

This means there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decide to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of employees who are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they share equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, if they share this candy equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A:
\[ 7 \times \$0.5 = \$3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B:
\[ 10 \times \$0.75 = \$7.5 \]

Now, let's add these two amounts to find the total cost:
\[ \$3.5 + \$7.5 = \$11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ \$15 - \$11 = \$4 \]

Therefore, the change Adam received is:
\[ \$4 \]"
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. Since her first 8 days were good, her next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days - Good days - Bad days = Neutral days
30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days

Now, adding the next 3 days (good, neutral, and good) to the count of good days:
12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14 good days

So, the number of good days left in the month is 14.

14"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Growth rate per day = 30 inches
- Number of days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate per day = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate these 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. After buying these toys, the total number of toys James has is 12 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 24 toys.
7. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he no longer needs to buy toys for these 3 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is the number of toys he has after the second purchase, which is 24.

**Total number of toys James needs: 24**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Total Investment**: The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment**: Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment**: Subtract Dylan's investment from the total.

"To reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Adding these together:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

They want to have 100 signatures in total. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \text{ per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours at her hourly rate of $20:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$120 \]

So, Karen earns \(\$120\) in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. The amount by which the group will exceed this limit is:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

They have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80 cm"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves of the lawn:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals $2 * 2 = $4

"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they bake \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 23 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \]

So, the age of the older triplet (and thus the age of the twin) is:

\[ x + 7 = 5.75 + 7 = 12.75 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 12.75 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of 10 candies would be:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = \frac{3.20}{4} \times 10 = 0.80 \times 10 = 8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 0.40 \times 10 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we can calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is 5760."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate, so the cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate, so the cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate, so the cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is **$32.0**."

   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so:
   \[
   \text{Green Squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so:
   \[
   \text{White Squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares:
\[
\text{Total Squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of high chairs needed:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs needed:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs needed = number of high chairs + number of regular chairs.
   - Total chairs needed = 8 + 40 = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total people = 42 + 15 = 57.

5. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed = total people - total chairs available.
   - Since the restaurant already has 48 chairs, the additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9.

**Final numerical answer:**
9 more chairs does she have to get."

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend."

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will see 40% of these fireworks:

- Hannah's view = 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 fireworks (city) + 15 fireworks (her own) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 800 \, \text{pounds} = 4,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We already know the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 4,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, we can solve for Gary's truck capacity:

\[ 8,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} - 8,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - Number of females = 6
   - Number of males = 8 (including Larry)

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males
   - Total dumplings = 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, let's determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 \text{ (initial hours)} + 6 \text{ (additional hours)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

8%"
"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is \(14 \times 12 = 168\).

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to calculate how much of each type of ice cream can be made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the two amounts together gives the total production in 48 hours:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total before the discount:

Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtracting the discount from the total:

Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works with these 4 scoops. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, with 4 scoops, she can get 2 free scoops (since 4/2 = 2).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she will have is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream."
"Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 square feet bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

First, calculate two thirds of the bathroom area:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Price per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Price per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
   - Savings = $75 - $65
   - Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original planned price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   \[
   6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Cost if the city fixes the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - The city council will not charge Ron for this if they fix it.
   - Therefore, the cost to Ron is $0.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron will also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is \(120 + 75 = 195\) dollars.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole himself:**
   - The cost if the city fixes it is $0.
   - The cost if Ron fixes it himself is $195.

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three of them together ate:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two of them together ate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

   \]

The percentage of her spools that are blue is 40%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 5000 people in line to vote.

2. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by midday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people remaining in line by midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people remaining in line by 16:00 is:

   - Since 24 smores are needed and 24 smores can be made from one box, they will need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, if Dora is 15, her father's age is:
\[ 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, her mother's age is:
\[ 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
\[ 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each of them got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weight of each book together.

1. Math and science books: Each weighs 2 pounds, and there are 2 of them, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
2. French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
3. English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
4. History book: Weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add all the weights together:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, candidate B received:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total votes for candidates A and B are:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes for candidate C is:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
\[32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}\]

So, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the packs Mark bought:

3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he received:

- One card is worth $4000
- Another card is worth $1000
- 30 more cards are worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500

Adding these values together gives the total value of all the cards:

$4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

$6500 (total value of cards) - $5400 (total cost) = $1100

So, the profit Mark made is $1100."
"To determine the savings, we first need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12/child = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10/child = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks to determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of first amusement park - Cost of second amusement park
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the difference in cost per tomato and then multiply that by the number of tomatoes sold per day, and finally, multiply by the number of days in a week.

1. The cost per tomato with the new vendor is $0.40.
2. The cost per tomato with the old vendor was $0.50.
3. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
4. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are 500 * $0.10 = $50.
5. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

The vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has as follows:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can determine the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles."
"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Next, we need to find out how many groups are required for 12 groups of students, assuming each group still has 9 students:

12 groups * 9 students per group = 108 students

Now, we calculate how many more students are needed to reach 108 students from the original 54 students:

108 students - 54 students = 54 more students

Since we need 12 groups and we currently have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are required:

12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form the required 12 groups."
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversion Rates:**
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - From small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers: 20 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. However, since we are asked for the final numerical answer, we'll use the exact fraction:

"First, let's calculate how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can find the number of pears by calculating 45% of the number of bananas and then adding that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, the number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290 = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits."

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he has already made from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ dollars per ear of corn} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

Time left after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for playing soccer is:

Time for soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time for soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to drive to the museum:**

   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time to drive back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles, and the speed is the same, 75 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. **Total time gone from home:**
   - Time to drive to the museum + Time at the museum + Time to drive back = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels left will be 276."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find 20% of $1000, then subtract that amount from the original price.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the movies in series from the total:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Normal movies**: The remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total cost**: Add up the costs for all the movies:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
\[

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking, then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance covered by driving is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was \(5\) miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half their driving speed is \(50 / 2 = 25\) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.
   - The distance covered by hiking is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Points from Enemies:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10.
   - So, the difference in points from enemies = \(8 \times 10 = 80\).

2. **Points from Berries:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5.
   - So, the difference in points from berries = \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

3. **Points from Time:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left on the timer = 30.
   - So, the difference in points from time = \(-4 \times 30 = -120\) (negative because Ava is slower).

Now, let's sum up the differences:
- Difference in points from enemies: \(+80\)
- Difference in points from berries: \(+15\)
- Difference in points from time: \(-120\)

Total difference in scores = \(80 + 15 - 120 = -25\).

So, the difference between their two scores is \(-25\). This means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's score."
"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so:

2 * (3 rides/day) * 2 days = 12 rides

Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Therefore, they ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding these to his pond, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \). Therefore, \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also have the equation from the total number of fish bought:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work. Therefore, the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he works from Monday to Friday, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel used for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Hours played in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

**Final answer:**
20 miles"
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900.

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270.

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\) or 80%. Therefore, 80% of 400 fifth graders passed, which is \(0.8 \times 400 = 320\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage, the overall pass rate is \(68\%\).

**Final numerical answer: 68%**"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so the total amount they drank is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so the total amount they drank is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies Dale has = Initial candies + Additional candies ordered
Total candies Dale has = 100 + 100 = 200

Candies already sold = 150

Candies still to be sold = Total candies - Candies already sold
Candies still to be sold = 200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and by the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional students that joined are:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches/day} \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used by both = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:

- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available for making S'mores:

- Total marshmallows used + marshmallows dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. So, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

- Marshmallows left = Original number - Total used and dropped = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

- Marshmallows each can have = 14 / 2 = 7 marshmallows.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long is \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters each of these two friends uses is \( \frac{120}{10} = 12 \) quarters.
   - The total game time for the better friend is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters the better friend uses is \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

3. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - Each of the two friends who play half as long uses 12 quarters, so together they use \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) quarters.
   - The better friend uses 8 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 \) quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 44 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

We are given that the total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( z = s \), we can substitute \( z \) with \( s \):

\[ 2s + 4s = 10 \]
\[ 6s = 10 \]
\[ s = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats at $500 each.
- The total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows at $1500 each.
- The total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars he gives away and sells is:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy walked over the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Step 2: Total number of tasks per week
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week.

Step 3: Total earnings
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings per week = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week.

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. However, we are asked for the total points Sasha scored, not Julie's.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund amount = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund amount - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total amount spent is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left."
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's break down the production for each week:

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, we know the total monthly production is 50,000 bars. We can calculate the production for the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:

\[ \text{Fourth week production} = 50,000 - (8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000) \]
\[ \text{Fourth week production} = 50,000 - 36,000 \]
\[ \text{Fourth week production} = 14,000 \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = \(18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Monthly recording time = \(72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Weekly writing time = 2 hours.
   - Monthly writing time = \(2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = \(15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Monthly makeup time = \(90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

- Total monthly time = \(288 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 8 \text{ hours (writing)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)}\).

First, convert the hours to minutes:
- 8 hours = \(8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, sum all the minutes:
- Total monthly time = \(288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes} = 1128 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the given information.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - Angela needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - Angela needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times \$15.00 = \$30.00\)
   - Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times \$15.00 = \$15.00\)
   - Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times \$15.00 = \$150.00\)

4. **Total Additional Cost**: \( \$30.00 + \$15.00 + \$150.00 = \$195.00 \)

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost

**Final Answer**: The total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Roy's total savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

**Final answer**: 40 feet"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos and the distance they travel. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, we can denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of each kangaroo as \(S\). The total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:

\[ D = 3 \times S \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

We need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Let's denote the time it takes for the turtles as \(T\). The distance \(D\) can also be expressed in terms of the turtles' speed and time as:

\[ D = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]

Since the distance \(D\) is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:

\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = 2 \times S \times T \]

We can cancel \(S\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(S \neq 0\)):

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times T \]

\[ 54 = 2 \times T \]

Solving for \(T\):

\[ T = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we can use this information to find out how many dishes Rory and Jada made.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount should be equal to the cost of the laptop minus the $50 she still needs:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Combining like terms on the left side:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the unused length is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused length is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused length is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Adding these unused lengths together:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
20 millimeters"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800
- Total cost: $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200
- Total money Gabriel has: $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, we subtract the total money Gabriel has from the total cost to find out how much more he needs:

- Total cost: $10800
- Total money Gabriel has: $5200
- Money still needed: $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = \$80\).

The hat cost $70, so the change Thea received is \(80 - 70 = \$10\).

Therefore, the change Thea got is \$10."
"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to $40.

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so that's \(6 \times 2 = $12\).

He spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so that's \(3 \times 3 = $9\).

The total amount spent is \(12 + 9 = $21\).

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount, we get \(40 - 21 = $19\).

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding both totals together:
- Total number of socks and dishes = \( 90 + 90 = 180 \)

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only, the number of students who are good at both subjects is \(20 - 5 - 8 = 7\).

So, the total number of students good at math (both only and both) is \(5 + 7 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

1. **Time per group:**
   - Getting on stage: 2 minutes
   - Performing: 6 minutes
   - Exiting the stage: 2 minutes
   - Total time per group: \(2 + 6 + 2 = 10\) minutes

2. **Total concert time:**
   - The show is 2 hours long, which is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Including a 10-minute intermission, the total time available for performances is \(120 - 10 = 110\) minutes.

3. **Number of groups:**
   - To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available performance time by the time each group takes: \(110 \div 10 = 11\).

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is **11**."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form
- Time (T) = 3 years

Now, let's calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years will be the original principal plus the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

**White shirts without collars**:
- Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining white shirts without collars are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts without buttons**:
- Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts without buttons are \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

**Difference between floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars**:
- The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
- The number of white shirts without collars is 20.
- The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

**Final numerical answer**:

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

70 goats"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year, he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket.
   - So, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - So, the total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \) or \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation, we get:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substituting \( A \) into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost for the phones is:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gives $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's calculate how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly cost} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the monthly cost:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly cost} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \]

Since the question asks for the amount Keenan spends per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]
   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

5. **Pieces eaten on the third day**: \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

6. **Total pieces eaten so far**: 
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48
   \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"To find out how much David will spend, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   - $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has.
David has $12.48, so after buying the bolts, he will have:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is $12.00."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate for dog walking.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. So, her hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:
\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = \$11 \times 12 = \$132 \]

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles, so he then has:

\[52 + 28 = 80\]

After receiving the additional marbles, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\]

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total gives:

\[80 - 20 = 60\]

So, Paul has 60 marbles left."

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the cost price of the chickens he took to the market is:
\[ \text{Cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by Micah.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5.

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hair Treatment Cost**: Iris spent $400 on her hair treatment.

2. **Manicure Cost**: She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair treatment. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \text{Manicure Cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Pedicure Cost**: She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \text{Pedicure Cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Hair Cost} + \text{Manicure Cost} + \text{Pedicure Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:
\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age as \( x \).

Her age in \( x \) years will be \( 8 + x \). According to the problem, this age will be thrice her current age, which is 8. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. With 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes."
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

200 - 150 = 50

Argo now has 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

The final numerical answer is:
500"
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired, and the remaining microphones will be paired up. So, we subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that can be paired. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 

2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead is:

Adding all these together, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

**Total number of birds: 34**"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Now, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( x \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11x \) meters per second. Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11x = 121 \]
\[ x = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost for the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and his pay was increased by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 480 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, and Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, we can set up the following equation for the total amount earned from mowing lawns:

\[ 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

Since the total amount earned from mowing lawns is part of the $80 she made, we can write:

\[ 54x = \text{Total from mowing lawns} \]

The total amount from mowing lawns plus the amount from lemonade sales equals $80:

\[ 54x + \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 \]

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we need to determine \( x \). Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn \( x \) times, we can find \( x \) as follows:

\[ 6x = 6 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( x = 1 \) back into the equation for the total earnings:

\[ 54(1) + \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 \]
\[ 54 + \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 \]
\[ \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 \]
\[ \text{Lemonade sales} = 26 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, 4 child bowls will be left as leftovers.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup equally between them:
4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child.

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The total amount spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought. Since there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and she has seen each one 3 times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk)} = 19 \text{ hours}\]

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the free time Harold has left is:
\[24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the final number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. After losing 2 books, Joseph currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, he gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, he gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, we calculate how many marbles Dean has left:
\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

So, the equation based on the given information is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm first:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Then, we add 100 acres to this amount:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

200 acres (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 acres (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$64.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku:**
   - A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30: \(180 \div 30 = 6\).

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. There are 20 red balloons.
4. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58.

First, calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of bologna pieces for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals to:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = $3
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = $14
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = $28
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = $14
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball. There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two sports:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of soccer players is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Finally, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:

\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

2. **Determine the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip.

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to determine how much water is initially transferred to the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water. Therefore, the amount of water in the tank is:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - **Movies**: 5 (Fridays or Saturdays) + 8 (other days) = 13 movies
     - Cost per movie on Fridays or Saturdays: $10
     - Cost per movie on other days: $7
     - Total cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
     - Total cost for 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
     - Total cost for 13 movies: $50 + $56 = $106
   - **Popcorn**: 2 tubs at $8 each
     - Total cost for popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
   - **Candy**: 4 boxes at $2 each
     - Total cost for candy: 4 * $2 = $8
   - **Total expenses so far**: $106 + $16 + $8 = $130

3. **Remaining Budget**: $150 - $130 = $20

4. **Current Day Expenses**:
   - **Movie**: It's a Friday, so the ticket costs $10.
   - **Popcorn**: $8
   - **Candy**: $2
   - **Total for current day**: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

5. **Remaining Budget After Current Day Expenses**: $20 - $20 = $0

Since Colby's remaining budget is exactly $0 after accounting for the current day's expenses, he cannot see any more movies.

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \text{ calories} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days in a month: 30
     - Total widgets = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days in a month: 30
     - Total widgets = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:**

   - **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Calculate the difference in revenue:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

**Final numerical answer:**

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by paying for the additional hours instead of a full 24-hour stay is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 5 = 35\).

Now, to find the total number of children, we multiply the number of children per row by the total number of rows:

\[8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children}\]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The parts charge: $60

Now, we add these components together:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15/\text{CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40\% \times \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ \text{Total money from selling 5 CDs} = 5 \times \$40 = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. We subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:

\[ \text{Money out} = \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained money from the transaction. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - James swims at half the initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile/hour: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

**Final answer:**

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

From the second equation, we have \( B = A + 20 \).

From the third equation, we have \( B = D + 10 \).

Since both expressions are equal to \( B \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
\[ A = D - 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = A + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final numerical answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the information given about the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Asleep:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Converting 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Sleep Duration on That Day:**
   - Subtract the sleepwalking time from the total time Kim was asleep.
   - \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10

"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. This means:

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. Therefore, the total number of new admissions in 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

**Final answer: 100**"
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining 3 emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert.

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, including the two holes they filled in.

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

Adding these up, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.
2. Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins got as \( C \).
3. According to the problem, Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, so \( C = 70 + 15 = 85 \).

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips each person got:

\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
2. Add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The supplies cost $400, and the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. So, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost:

\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is $1000."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$300 = \$600 \]

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones gives us the total cost:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 8 * 1/4 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be represented as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.
5. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
     - Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
     - Apple pie: 15 boxes

   - **Saturday (revisited):**
     - Apple pie: Since Sunday's sales were 15 boxes of apple pie and it was 4 more than Saturday, then on Saturday, he sold \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes of apple pie.

2. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
     - Apple pie: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
     - Total for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
     - Apple pie: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
     - Total for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

3. **Calculate the total earnings for both days:**

   - Total earnings: \(\$225 + \$315 = \$540\)

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of \$540 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- Therefore, she uses \(1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day}\).

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:
- She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.
- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces}\).

Now, we determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to cover 32 ounces:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
- Therefore, the number of bottles required is \(\frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Since the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

$100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:

$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24, so his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24, so his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**50**"
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\$70.00\) filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is \(3 \div 1 = 3\).

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck:

\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the cooling and warming process step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Net change in temperature:
- Net cooling: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\)

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks for the electric bill per year.

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also totals \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month for the church. Over a year, this amounts to \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, let's break down the information given:

1. Adam's trousers cost $30.
2. His mother gave him $6.
3. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

So, Adam received a total of $18 from his parents. Since the trousers cost $30, we can find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

Given:
- \(A = 3\) (Akbar's age)
- \(Al = 4\) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[A + Al + H + W = 20\]

Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(Al\):
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

The average age of the group is:
\[\frac{A + Al + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now, substituting \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then donates $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from everyone else. Since the total collected from everyone else is $2200, the lawyer's donation will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. **Clinic Work Time**: 9 hours
2. **Inpatient Rounds**: 10 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 200 minutes = 200 / 60 = 3.33 hours
3. **Appointments**: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes = 300 / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add up the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
3.33 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8.33 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total available time:
9 hours (total available) - 8.33 hours (time spent) = 0.67 hours

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 0.67 hours left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes (or 3 hours).

Now, subtract 3 hours from the 5:00 pm serving time:
- 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \(P\) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \(M\).

Given that Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can write the equation:
\[4P = 64\]

Solving for \(P\):
\[P = \frac{64}{4} = 16\]

Given that Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can write the equation:
\[7M = 56\]

Solving for \(M\):
\[M = \frac{56}{7} = 8\]

Now, to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract \(M\) from \(P\):
\[P - M = 16 - 8 = 8\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, to find the cost to fill the pool, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

Let's denote the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park as \( x \).

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, calculate the values of the terms:

\[ (1 - 0.09)^5 = 0.91^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.93^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Now, substitute these values into the equation:

\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]

\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.8%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Hourly wage: $10
- Hourly tips: $15
- Total hourly earnings: $10 + $15 = $25

Next, we need to determine how much she wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of a $10,000 car:

- Down payment: 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Now, we calculate how much she earns in a week:

- Weekly earnings: $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1,000/week

Finally, we determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000:

- Weeks needed: $2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 900 sweets

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2 = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many sweets are in these 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase to the original price each year. The original price of carrots is $120.

After the first year, the price will be:
\[ 120 + 0.05 \times 120 = 120 \times 1.05 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price will be:
\[ 126 + 0.05 \times 126 = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30 \]

After the third year, the price will be:
\[ 132.30 + 0.05 \times 132.30 = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 139.465 \]

Rounding $139.465 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
2. She divided these pictures equally into 8 albums.
3. Each album would then contain \( \frac{72}{8} = 9 \) pictures.

Now, we know that 3 of these albums contain only selfies and 2 of the albums contain only portraits. This means that the remaining 3 albums (since 8 - 3 - 2 = 3) contain a mix of selfies and portraits.

4. The total number of pictures in the 3 albums that are only selfies is \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) selfies.
5. The total number of pictures in the 2 albums that are only portraits is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) portraits.

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is the sum of the selfies and portraits in the respective albums:

- Total selfies: 27
- Total portraits: 18

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is \( 27 + 18 = 45 \).

Final numerical answer:
45"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion based on the rate of reading.

If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 18 pages (which is 6 times more) will take 6 times as long.

\[ 10 \, \text{minutes} \times 6 = 60 \, \text{minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. So, \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests checked in.
5. **Additional Checkins After Dinner**: 7 more people checked in after dinner.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- After early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\) guests.
- After late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\) guests.
- After afternoon checkins: \(61 + 30 = 91\) guests.
- After additional checkins: \(91 + 7 = 98\) guests.

So, the hotel now has **98 guests**."

- Friday: 12 bananas

Total bananas = \(4 + 6 + 12 = 22\)

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the quiz into its components:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \(60 \times 0.40 = 24\)
- Number of average and difficult questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, the number of average questions is \(36 / 2 = 18\) and the number of difficult questions is also \(18\).

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \(24 \times 0.75 = 18\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)

Adding these up gives the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

\(18 + 9 + 9 = 36\)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the price of a small stuffed animal be \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal be \( L \).
2. According to the problem, \( L = 3S \).
3. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \( S = 4 \).
4. Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let the number of large stuffed animals sold be \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

The total earnings from the sales are given as $120. So, we can write the equation for total earnings as:
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

From the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

From the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total earnings:
$80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320

Next, we subtract the amount given to her sisters:
$320 - ($10 * 2) = $320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[30 + 30 = 60\]

The total number of eggs hidden was 100, and 10 eggs were not found by anyone. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:

\[100 - 60 - 10 = 30\]

So, the friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages, which is $1.50.

3. For the third package:
   - 8 sandwiches
   - Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, let's calculate the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set:

Cost of new bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling old bedroom set: $1000

Remaining amount to be paid: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. So, the monthly payment is:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons, so:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

This means she has 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, as she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her clutch. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her collection. Now, let's sum up all the balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.8.

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher being present and giving an extension: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)
- Probability of the normal teacher being present, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[0.94 \times 100 = 94\%\]

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Seats for graduates and faculty: \(950 + 300 = 1250\)
2. Available seats for tickets: \(6000 - 1250 = 4750\)
3. Number of graduates: (Not given, so let's assume the number of graduates is \(G\))
4. Tickets per graduate: \(\frac{4750}{G}\)

Since the number of graduates (\(G\)) is not provided, we can't give a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the number of graduates is, for example, 500, then:

\(\frac{4750}{500} = 9.5\)

So, if there are 500 graduates, each would receive 9.5 tickets.

Final numerical answer (assuming 500 graduates): 9.5 tickets per graduate."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(2 \times 75 = 150\).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium jelly bean is 3.
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

**Step 2: Determine the total time.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is 8 intervals * 5 seconds/interval = 40 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
40 seconds"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent and lost.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled, so his new income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

5. **Calculate how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then sum them up.

1. For the chicken salad:
- Number of people: 10
- Cost per person: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad: \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars

2. For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6
- Total cost for pasta salad: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars

Now, we add the total costs for both types of salads:
- Total cost for chicken salad: $65
- Total cost for pasta salad: $36
- Total amount Molly will pay: \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **$101**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Race**: Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. **Second Race**: He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. **Third Race**: He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: \(11 - 21.5 = -10.5\)

So, overall, he lost $10.5.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

**Final numerical answer:**
3.5"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America: There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).
2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier are to be compared in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. Convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Since there are 4 painters, the hours each painter worked is:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

Let's calculate the value of the car at the end of each year:

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Value in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Value in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Value in 2010} = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9831.78
   \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9831.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, let's break down the information given:

1. Total number of books = 50
2. Half of them are written in English, so the number of English books = 50 / 2 = 25
3. 10% of them are written in German, so the number of German books = 10% of 50 = 0.10 * 50 = 5

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - Number of English books - Number of German books
Number of Spanish books = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first calculate the total distance she has already covered and then subtract this from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers

Distance remaining: 1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[ 120 + 20 = 140 \]

3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[ 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"

Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt per tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be \$2400."
"First, we calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increase, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds per week. 

Since he washes 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to do 2 loads for the twins and 1 load for the king, totaling 3 loads per week.

In a year, there are 52 weeks. Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is:

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

156"
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they continue this pattern for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24 movies"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total gives:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the daily consumption of cat food:
   - Imma has 3 cats.
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
   - Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.
   - For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

2. Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total cat food available: 720 grams.
   - Daily consumption: 360 grams.
   - Number of days the food will last: \( \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. Over a 5-day work week, the number of emails he responds to is:

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:

- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
- 70% of 20 is \( 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \) pizzas.

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
- \( 20 - 14 = 6 \) pizzas.

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:

- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) pizzas.
- The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
- 80% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \) pizzas.

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
- \( 40 - 32 = 8 \) pizzas.

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
- \( 6 + 8 = 14 \) pizzas.

"First, let's calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical issues, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. This means the remaining trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser are:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each of these 15 trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day: 300."
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price. 

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

So, for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first 2 pounds, he pays $6.00.
- For the next 2 pounds, he pays another $6.00.
- For the last 2 pounds, he pays another $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $6.00 + $6.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$18.00"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

$125 (theater rental) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she had $60, a quarter of her money is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
   \]
   So, Maggie spent $15. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
   \[
   60 - 15 = 45
   \]

2. Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she also had $60, one-third of her money is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, Riza spent $20. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

3. To find out how much money the two of them have left in total, we add the amounts left by Maggie and Riza:
   \[
   45 + 40 = 85
   \]

Therefore, the two of them have $85 left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Together, the first and second monkeys eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a week is 315. Therefore, the number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys each day is \(315 \div 7 = 45\).

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day:

\(45 - 24 = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since a quarter is worth $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

Jenny leaves with 20 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total:

$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then express this difference as a percentage of the original price.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

First, calculate twice Binkie's score:
2 * 90 = 180

Then, add 15 to this amount to find Frankie's score:
180 + 15 = 195

Frankie's score was 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles. Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. At $0.80 per banana, the total cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\) by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, the annual growth rate is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

1. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the total bikes sold, which is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) bikes.
2. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the total bikes sold, which is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) bikes.
3. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold, which is \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.
2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars (since a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)).
3. **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:

\[ 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \]

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales per hour:**
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced - Hay picked up
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer starts with no bales in the field (assuming the field was empty before starting), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.
   - Number of bales left = 12 bales

**Final numerical answer:**
12 bales"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this time equally on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time per week is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32 \text{ feet}} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is \(6 \times 12 = 72\) inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is \(72 + 2 = 74\) inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is \(74 - 5 = 69\) inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is \(69 + 3 = 72\) inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 9. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances traveled by each train:
   \[
   180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. 

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.

So, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, the number of days he takes off is \(50 \times 0.20 = 10\) days.

Therefore, the number of days he works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) people.

Thus, the total number of people he helps in 40 days is \(40 \times 6 = 240\) people.

Final numerical answer:
240"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, as these would be the people who attended the ceremony.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people carried by the buses is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people carried by the cars is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people who attended the ceremony:
- Total number of people = \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 480."
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is \(24 - 4 = 20\) years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is \(20 + 10 = 30\) years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to ride the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to ride the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time spent on breaks and lunch each day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on breaks and lunch.

After 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is:
1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. **Return**: She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge.
3. **New Balance after Return**: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
4. **Frying Pan Purchase**: The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. So, the sale price is:
   - 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   - Sale price of the frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
5. **Set of Towels Purchase**: The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. So, the sale price is:
   - 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   - Sale price of the set of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
6. **Total New Purchases**: The total for the frying pan and the set of towels is:
   - $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
7. **Final Balance**: Adding the new purchases to the balance after the return:
   - $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \)."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual Retirement Expense} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total Retirement Savings Needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual Savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Years Needed} = \frac{\text{Total Retirement Savings Needed}}{\text{Annual Savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike if she wants to finish on time.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in June:
- June has 30 days.

Next, let's determine how many miles Soledad plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
- Miles per day = 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles she would hike in June if she walks 250 miles each day:
- Total miles in June = 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Since Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal:
- Additional miles needed = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
- Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
\[27 + 55 + 75 = 157\]

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount of apples left for James is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have \(\boxed{5}\) kilograms left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left.

**Final Answer: 8**"
"To find out how much each of the books cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Anna's initial budget: $16
2. Amount spent: $4
3. Amount left: $2
4. Number of books bought: 2

First, we need to find out how much Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ \text{Amount spent on books} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Amount left} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on books} = 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna spent $14 on 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. To find the cost of each book, we divide the total amount spent on books by the number of books:

\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Amount spent on books}}{\text{Number of books}} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each of the books cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year, there were 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there is an increase of 10 students this year. To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, we calculate the blinking rate per minute:
\[ \text{Blinking rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish:
- He buys 2 more male guppies, so now he has 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies.
- He buys 1 more female guppy, so now he has 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.
- He buys 2 more male goldfishes, so now he has 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes.
- He buys 3 more female goldfishes, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To calculate the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to determine the time each person spent on their respective chores and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours.
   - Since ""well over 4 hours"" is not a precise number, we can assume it means at least 8 hours (as it's the smallest number greater than 4 hours that is commonly used in such problems).
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 8 hours = 12 hours.

Now, we sum the times:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 12 hours
- Total time = 22 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 22 hours."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits
   - Total distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Combined, these 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the 4 workers in a 10-hour shift:**
   - Since they produce 20 toys per hour, in 10 hours they produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers and the remaining needed toys:**
   - The order requires 400 toys, and after the 4 workers have worked, 200 toys have been produced.
   - The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order, so the 4 workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The 4 workers produced 380 toys in 10 hours.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced \(400 - 380 - 20 = 0\) toys in 10 hours, but since the total production by the 4 workers is 380, the fifth worker must have produced \(400 - 380 = 20\) toys in 10 hours.

5. **Calculate the toys produced per hour by the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker produced 20 toys in 10 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{20}{10} = 2 \) toys per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he gave to Kris were the other half. This means Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the 32 stickers Luis had were half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we calculate the total number of M&M he has:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of eggs painted by Arnold be \( A \).
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let the number of eggs painted by Camden be \( C \) and by Sarah be \( S \).
4. We know that \( C + S = 30 \) and \( C = S + 12 \).

From the second piece of information, we can substitute \( C \) in the first equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

The total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write this as:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from these 64 feet:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of her walk is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Time on beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week for 8 weeks.
Total saved = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks required to save $28 is:
Number of weeks = $28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together to get the total number of blue birds:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of these marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the scenario where the temperature of the water from the second mug, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water.

The equation for the temperature of the mixture is:
\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men: \( 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet is sold for $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets = 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from individual sales + Sunflowers from bouquets = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

**Final numerical answer:**
291"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

So, Adam earns $84 from selling the rocks.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to subtract the revenue from the initial investment:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. May has 31 days.

First, calculate the daily food cost for all the fish:
3 fish * $1/fish/day = $3/day

Now, calculate the monthly food cost for May:
$3/day * 31 days = $93

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia initially had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket. Given that the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, and the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning (since 20% * 3 = 60%).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Probability of both winning} = 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

\[ 0.12 \times 100\% = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats:

\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So for the weekend, he eats:

\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling all the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
- He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) feet.

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Dressing the octuplets**:
   - 3/4 of the octuplets are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
   - 1/4 of the octuplets are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

3. **Wearing bows**:
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

   - Purple-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Total bow-wearers: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

5. **Percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Total number of bow-wearers: 4
   - Percentage: \( \frac{2}{4} \times 100\% = 50\% \)

**Final numerical answer**: 50%"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

Now, let's calculate the reports received on Wednesday:

5168 (total reports) - 1907 (Monday and Tuesday) - 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by calculating half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined total, so it has \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:
- First complex: 200 apartments
- Second complex: 200 apartments
- Third complex: 640 apartments

Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\] collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\] dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[1248\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[x - 200 = \text{fruits produced by 8-year-old tree}\]

Since the 8-year-old tree produces 150 fruits, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 150\]
\[x = 150 + 200\]
\[x = 350\]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is **1650**."
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

Now, we add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Jack now has $120."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B = 30 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

\[ 2 \text{ pints} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. 

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you have $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   - Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills.

3. **Using Half for a Bill**: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 40 bills is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills.
   - Cost of the bill: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Money**: After paying for the bill, he triples the remaining money.
   - Remaining money after paying the bill: \( 1000 - 400 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Tripling the money: \( 600 \times 3 = 1800 \) dollars.

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills**: He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   - Number of 5 dollar bills: \( \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \) bills.

**Final Answer**: Thomas has 360 five-dollar bills."
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length of chalk} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be reduced to 2 inches or less. We can do this by iteratively subtracting the daily usage from the current length of the chalk until it is 2 inches or less.

- **Day 1:**
  \[ 2.75 - 0.20 \times 2.75 = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]

- **Day 2:**
  \[ 2.20 - 0.20 \times 2.20 = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls who are on varsity.

   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Teeth fixed = 15
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is:
50%"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was spoiled.

\[ \text{Spoiled milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer: Colin is 20 years old."
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy for $27000, we need to determine how many sets of $500 are in $27000:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

**Final Answer:**
1800"

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's 6 friends will eat.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, for these three days, the total is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, the total is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days together:

\(9 + 10 = 19\)

So, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net Gain of Snowballs Per Hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour:
   \[
   \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time elapsed since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the exact year of Digimon's 20th anniversary, we can assume that the current year is the year of the 20th anniversary. Therefore, 20 years have passed since Digimon's debut.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old 20 years ago.

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices each one ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 + 50 - 38 = 50\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 + 50 - 28 = 72\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(72 + 100 - 25 = 147\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match this condition.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \((x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \((x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, we set up the equation:
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

This negative value doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, indicating a miscalculation in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \((x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \((x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

Given the final condition, we need to correct the equation:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

This indicates a need to recheck the problem statement and the steps. The correct interpretation should be:

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \((x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \((x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

Given the final condition, the correct equation is:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

Rechecking the problem, the correct initial number of bandages is:
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

The correct initial number of bandages is 31.

"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost per inch of haircut is $30. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means her hair was cut by 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \(2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60\).

3. **Total cost**: Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut gives us \( \$40 + \$60 = \$100 \).

So, the total cost of May's cut and color is **$100**."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\$280"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   \[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \]

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \]

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   \[ 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[ 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's calculate the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 20 bottles of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find out how much John spends on everything:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

Final numerical answer:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 22."

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs based on the average:
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in a day is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives us the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the loan amount John gets by mortgaging his home. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan amount he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off his debts.

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know the capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the information given:

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
2. Jordan has 2 children, so the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.
4. Since Jordan changes the other half, he changes the remaining \(10 - 5 = 5\) diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

**Final Answer:**
Tim was 36 red jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became \(20 + 40 = 60\).
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people entered the bus. Now, the number of people on the bus is \(60 + 30 = 90\).
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:

\[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost increases by 1.5 times the original cost.

\[ \text{Increase in cost} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Therefore, the cost for one year is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

For 5 years, the total cost is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5. Therefore, the cost for one year is:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

For 3 years, the total cost is:

\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Adding the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years gives the total amount Pauline spent:

\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide the total number of students by the group size:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, the total time required is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

1. The cost of the wooden tables:
   - John made 4 wooden tables.
   - Each table costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

2. The cost of the roof frames:
   - John made 2 roof frames.
   - Each roof frame costs $10.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

3. Adding the costs together:
   - Total cost for tables: $80
   - Total cost for roof frames: $20
   - Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"First, we calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each is 35 inches wide, the total width is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. Cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - Each minute costs $0.25.

2. Cost for the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes):
   - Each minute costs $0.20.
   - Total cost for 20 minutes = 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

3. Total cost for the 36-minute call:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes.
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$8.00"
"Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

It is expected to rain 1 more inch than this amount on Tuesday, so the expected rain on Tuesday is 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B \]

Each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost for the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost for the nail art.
3. Add the costs together.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted cost for the manicure and pedicure.**

- The original cost for a manicure is $35.
- The original cost for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original cost.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted cost for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted cost for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Total discounted cost for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for the nail art.**

- Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails (5 on each hand).
- The cost for nail art per nail is $3.

Total cost for nail art: \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \)

**Step 3: Add the costs together.**

Total cost: \( 60 + 30 = 90 \)

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $90."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[3 \times 12 = 36\] issues per year.

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[6\] issues per year.

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[4 \times 6 = 24\] issues per year.

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\] issues per year.

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[3 + 1 + 1 = 5\]

Final numerical answer:

"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's total:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - Final price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:

\[ \$80 - (25\% \times \$80) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled over the 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he doesn't stop at all during the day, which is an approximation since the question mentions stops for gas, relaxation, etc., but we'll use this for calculation purposes), the distance he covers in one day is:

\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:

\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we have:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since the recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother made 4 pies, we have:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes used for the juice and the pies:

\[ 30 + 48 = 78 \text{ grapes} \]

Since these 78 grapes are the total used, and this is the amount that was left after Madeline ate her grapes, we need to add the grapes Madeline ate to find the initial number of grapes:

\[ 78 + 6 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the initial number of grapes was:

\[ 84 \]"

"To calculate how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs:

1. **Pasta cost per week**: $1.00
2. **Cheddar cheese cost per week**: $3.00
3. **Gruyere cheese cost per week**: Twice the cheddar cheese cost, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
- Total weekly cost = Pasta cost + Cheddar cheese cost + Gruyere cheese cost
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
- Total yearly cost = Total weekly cost * 52 weeks
- Total yearly cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day
Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

Half of the hats are red, so:
\[ \text{Red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

After removing the red hats, the remaining hats are:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so:
\[ \text{Blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white, so:
\[ \text{White hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"To find the cost per stick of jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discounted price of the bag.
2. Calculate the total cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick to cents.

Step 1: The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. So, the cost per stick in dollars is:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Step 3: Convert the cost per stick to cents. Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per stick in cents is:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents."
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. Therefore, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. To find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got correct on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get correct:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."
"Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. Each game, she scores 21 points. To find the total number of points she has scored, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply that by her average score per game.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, let's break down the information given:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
   - Total flashlights = \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each. So, \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms have 4 small candles each. Total small candles = \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, \(4\) rooms have 5 medium candles each. Total medium candles = \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Total candles = \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together:
- Total flashlights = 20
- Total candles = 36
- Combined total = \(20 + 36 = 56\).

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side takes the same time as the fifth side, which is 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the times:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30\) minutes.

The Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70
\]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting = 7 minutes
- Number of paintings = 6
- Total drying time = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting = 12 minutes
- Number of paintings = 6
- Total drying time = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."

"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
500 people."
"Let's break down the popping rates and calculate the total number of popped kernels.

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the popped kernels from the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.

   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for each breed and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
- 3 German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- 2 Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

Now, to find the weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

- The 10 2-legged animals contribute \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.
- The 15 4-legged animals contribute \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Adding these together, the total number of legs is \(20 + 60 = 80\).

Since we are asked for the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

- Total pairs of legs = \(80 \div 2 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[12 + R = 32\]

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, luggage, and children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of feed left after a week is **20 pounds**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies:

- Revenue from cupcakes: \(20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40\)
- Revenue from cookies: \(40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40\)

Total revenue = Revenue from cupcakes + Revenue from cookies
Total revenue = \$40 + \$40 = \$80

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays:

- Cost of trays: \(5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20\)

Now, we can find out how much money Frances has left by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Money left = Total revenue - Total cost
Money left = \$80 - \$20 = \$60

Final numerical answer:
\$60"

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's do the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

To find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but Igor lost some on the way, so the number of beakers on the lab bench is less than 7.
4. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Petri dishes: 16
- Beakers: Let's denote the number of beakers as \(x\).

The equation for the total number of items is:

\[8 + 16 + x = 29\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[24 + x = 29\]
\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."

"Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran half as far, Aaron ran 2 miles. Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it took Aaron to run 2 miles is the same as the time it took Vanessa to run 1 mile. Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so it took him 8 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa, it means Vanessa took twice as long to run the same distance. Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to run 1 mile. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time she took to complete her part of the race is:

\[ 16 \text{ minutes/mile} \times 4 \text{ miles} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's work} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
