"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is \(3 + 4 = 7\) eggs.

The number of eggs remaining after Janet uses some for herself and baking is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times \$2/\text{egg} = \$18 \]

Therefore, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh made a profit of \(\boxed{70000}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses are in each price category. Since every second glass is at the reduced price, out of 16 glasses, 8 will be at the full price and 8 will be at the reduced price.

Calculate the total cost for the full-price glasses:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Calculate the total cost for the reduced-price glasses:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Trip to the Turnaround Point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since he has 4 hours total and spent 2.5 hours so far) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on the return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

**Final Answer:**
Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Then, subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Next, we calculate the net profit each year:

- Net profit per year = Annual Revenue - Annual Costs
- Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to break even. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:

\[ \text{Total Net Profit} = n \times \text{Net Profit per Year} \]

We set this equal to the initial cost to find \( n \):

\[ n \times 7.5 = 90 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house, and thus she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent walking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Determine the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Determine the age difference between Raymond and his son:**
   - Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and he was born 6 years before Samantha, we need to find out how old Raymond was when Samantha was 25.
   - When Samantha was 25, Raymond was \(25 - 6 = 19\) years old.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23, which means Raymond's son was born \(23 - 19 = 4\) years after Raymond was 19.

4. **Calculate the year Raymond's son was born relative to Samantha's current age:**
   - Since Samantha is currently 31, and Raymond's son was born 4 years after Raymond was 19, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.
   - Raymond was 19 years old 4 years before he had his son, and since Samantha is now 31, we need to find the difference between Samantha's current age and the age she was when Raymond's son was born.
   - Samantha was 25 when Raymond was 19, and Raymond's son was born 4 years later, so Raymond's son was born when Samantha was \(25 + 4 = 29\) years old.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born \(31 - 29 = 2\) years ago.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price Kyle paid.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

2. Determine the distance to the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the daily care time for one dog:**
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. **Calculate the daily care time for all dogs:**
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily care time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly care time:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, John spends **35 hours a week** taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Final Answer:**
70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the calculation confirms the money spent and the leftover, we now need to determine how many lego sets he still has. The problem states that he sold all his lego sets initially, so he no longer has any lego sets left. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much on the other two days as he does on the first day.
   - Distance on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days = \( 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.

4. **Given total distance:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.
   - Therefore, \( 6v = 60 \).

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   - \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance covered while running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance covered while walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

3. **Age of Brandon's iPhone**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 8 years."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. With the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories from the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the remaining calories available for the day:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - The bag contains 1250 calories for 300g.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, after using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( \boxed{163} \)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \).

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The total number of units is 120.
   - The number of occupied units is 90.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is \( 120 - 90 = 30 \).

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."

   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's revenue ($480), we calculate the difference:

- Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Adopted Kittens:**
   - The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

2. **Kittens Born to House Cats:**
   - Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, the number of kittens Patchy has is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21
     \]
   - Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Number of Kittens:**
   - Adding the adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
     \[
     7 + 21 + 12 = 40
     \]

"First, we calculate the total cost of the materials and construction:

\[ \text{Total cost of materials and construction} = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of insuring the brooch, which is 10% of the total cost:

\[ \text{Cost of insurance} = 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of materials and construction to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

Therefore, Janet paid a total of \$1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two components of her pension: the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% of the value of the pension based on her years of service.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension**: Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension based on her years of service.

2. **Additional Pension Component**: Starting after 20 years, for each additional year of service, she gets an additional 5% of the value of the pension. Since she quits after 30 years, she has 10 additional years of service beyond the initial 20 years.

The value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000. For each additional year, she gets 5% of $50,000.

Let's calculate the additional pension for 10 years:
\[ \text{Additional pension per year} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]
\[ \text{Total additional pension for 10 years} = 2,500 \times 10 = 25,000 \]

So, her total annual pension after 30 years is the sum of the fixed annual pension and the additional pension:
\[ \text{Total annual pension} = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is $75,000."

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
- Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is \( \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \).

Next, we use the fuel efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank:
- The tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
- At 25 miles per gallon, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is \( 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, Sophia can drive \(\boxed{300}\) miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10%. Therefore, his new time is 90% of his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans were used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces of sauce}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Cars that drove through the traffic jam**:
   - After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
   - In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.

4. **Total cars that drove through the traffic jam**:
   - The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes. Then, \(x + 20 = 25\).

5. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x + 20 = 25
   \]
   \[
   x = 25 - 20
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away. She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she will have before giving any away is:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away 40 plants, the number of potted plants she will remain with is:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

**6 pages per day**"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[

"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. We calculate this as:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume of all 3 boxes} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total hours of TV he watched each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Each day, Frankie watched 1 hour of TV.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Thursday:**
   - Frankie watched 1 hour and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Friday:**
   - Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Total hours watched from Monday to Friday:**
   - Sum of hours from Monday to Friday: \(2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\).

5. **Total hours watched in the week:**
   - Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week.
   - Therefore, the hours watched on Wednesday: \(7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

6. **Determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday:**
   - Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5 \text{ hours}\).
   - Number of 30-minute episodes: \(\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}\).

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we add the number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice to find the total number of roll-ups eaten:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   - Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the total distance to the shore is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Prices have increased by 50%.
   - New price per board = \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on her running speeds.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in 3 hours = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles.

3. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance covered in 7 hours = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie stamped. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. Therefore, the number of letters she stamped is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

After stamping these 20 letters, she added them to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after this, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's denote the number of letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.
2. Julia's husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she used 3 spoons from the total.
4. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons left.

We can set up the equation based on the information provided:

\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, which means he bought \(38 + 6 = 44\) fish sausages.

"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

1. The cost for 4 watermelons is:

   \]
3. The cost for 10 oranges is:
   \[
   10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[
180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time spent = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Calculate the revenue from doctors' charges:**
   - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Total revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

3. **Calculate the revenue from patients' charges:**
   - Patients are charged $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

   - Total revenue = Revenue from doctors + Revenue from patients = $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost is the revenue from doctors' charges, which is $30,000.

6. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70,000 - $30,000 = $40,000.

**Final Answer:**
The hospital makes a profit of $40,000 from these visits."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps sequentially:

1. **Initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. **First round of quits**: A third of the elves quit. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, 20 elves quit, leaving:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ elves}
   \]
3. **Second round of quits**: 10 of the remaining elves quit. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves:

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total distance walked on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total distance of Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday to find the distance walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the distance walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance walked on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 4 + 24 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find the distance walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total distance of Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:
\[ 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ 3B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{6B + B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ 7B = 1400 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Now, using the relationship \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items and will not be taxed.

The cost of the non-food items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 (original cost) + $1 (tax) = $11

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for supplies per client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 60 bees have now returned.

To find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we need to account for the bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours.

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30 bees
- Bees that returned in the next 6 hours: 15 bees
- Bees that left in the following 6 hours: 60 bees

So, the total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees} \]

Out of these 90 bees, 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that did not return in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees} \]

These 75 bees are the ones that returned in the last 6 hours.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can substitute and solve for Dorothy's friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people had both tires inflated, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people had all their tires inflated, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For a unicycle, there is 1 tire. Since 1 person had their tire inflated, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

- Each pack contains 6 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with $10.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).
5. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Adding 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18

  - He has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours for these days: \(3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - He has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours for these days: \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add the hours from all the days in one week:
\[3 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 4 \text{ hours (TTh)} = 7 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[112\]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet for consistency, since the final answer is required in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Next, we calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Total length of chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Finally, we add these lengths together to get the total length of all the baked goods:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \).

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \).

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \).

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[
200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:
\[
3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is \(11 + 6 = 17\). After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the water depth on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the water depth on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

**Step 1: Determine the water depth on Tuesday.**

The water depth on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the water depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the water depth on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into this equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:

\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Hat Cost**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Jacket Cost**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. **Pants Cost**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato, and then multiply by the number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

**Total time for peeling:**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time for peeling 60 potatoes = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

**Total time for cutting:**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time for cutting 60 potatoes = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- 300 seconds = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

**Total prep time:**
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes
- Total prep time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of lemons and sugar based on the profit they made.

First, let's establish the relationship between the cost, revenue, and profit:

1. **Revenue per gallon**: They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 each.
   \[
   \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \times 0.50 = \$10
   \]

2. **Cost per gallon**: The cost includes $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar.
   \[
   \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5
   \]

3. **Profit per gallon**: The profit is the revenue minus the cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit per gallon} = \text{Revenue per gallon} - \text{Cost per gallon} = \$10 - \$5 = \$5
   \]

4. **Total profit**: They made a total profit of $25.
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = 25
   \]

5. **Number of gallons sold**: To find the number of gallons sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Number of gallons sold} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per gallon}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5
   \]

6. **Total cost of lemons**: The cost of lemons per gallon is $3. Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of lemons} = 5 \times 3 = \$15
   \]

Thus, the total amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
\[
\text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

4. **Giving money to daughter and wife**: Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife.
\[
\text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\).

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
   - This is a fixed amount and does not affect the number of rats.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - The total straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = \(160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} = 110 \text{ pieces}\).

4. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 110 pieces.
   - Let \(r\) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total number of rats = \(3r\).
   - Total straw for rats = \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).

5. **Setting up the equation:**
   - \(18r = 110\).

6. **Solving for \(r\):**
   - \(r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6.11\).

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem implies an equal distribution, we need to recheck the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the total straw for rats is exactly divisible by the number of rats in each cage.

Revisiting the setup:
- \(18r = 110\).
- \(r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9}\).

Given the context, the problem likely implies an integer solution, so we need to re-evaluate the total straw for rats to ensure it fits the integer requirement. The closest integer solution fitting the problem's context is:

- \(r = 6\).

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with monthly compounding interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Plugging in the values:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.061208 \]

So, the amount after 3 months is:
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost per bag of wheat is $20.
   - The cost to transport each bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - The total revenue for \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Therefore, the equation for profit is:
     \[
     30n - 22n = 400
     \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   8n = 400
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{400}{8}
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]

The trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the rate at which he collects peaches.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.**

Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. With ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the daily requirement is:
\[ \frac{35 \, \text{pounds/week}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- He edits an equal number of sentences for each of the two publishers.
- Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Now, let's calculate the payment from each publisher:

- Payment from Publisher A: \(500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}\)
- Payment from Publisher B: \(500 \text{ sentences} \times (2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence}) = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total payment Mark receives in a week:

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.
- Sara already has $10 saved.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total amount of money Sara will have:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 70 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time Gary spends walking. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) taken to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:
\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
\[500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \(\boxed{8}\) gallons of water."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

44"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, to find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, and then subtract their total from the overall total of 251 points.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this gives \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points for Yuri.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points for Brianna.

4. **Total Points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   Adding up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]

5. **Jojo's Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. Subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from this total gives Jojo's points:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how much time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time on crossword puzzles + Time on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

So, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost for Carlos and Benji's rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \( 180 \text{ dollars} \)."

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- After losing 8 water type cards, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards.
- After buying 14 grass type cards, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards James has:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type card. The probability is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \]

Convert the decimal to a percentage and round to the nearest integer:

1. **Base burrito**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up the cost of the base burrito and the additional items:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the cost of the upgrade:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has enough empty pens.

Let's calculate the total number of pens step by step:

- **First Cycle**: 
  - He uses 25 pens, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Second Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Third Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Fourth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Fifth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Sixth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Seventh Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Eighth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Ninth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

- **Tenth Cycle**:
  - He uses the 5 new pens, which leaves him with 5 + 20 = 25 empty pens.
  - He can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
  - Now he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens (from the 25 pens he used minus the 5 new pens he made).

After the tenth cycle, he will have 5 new pens and 20 empty pens. Since he can no longer make more pens (as he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen and he only has 20 empty pens), the process stops here.

Adding up all the pens he has:
- Initial pens: 25
- Pens made in cycles: 5 * 10 = 50

Total pens = 25 (initial) + 50 (made) = 75

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is **75**."

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[ R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from each pen pal per week is:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since Mike is corresponding with 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives from all pen pals per week is:

\[ 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \times 3 \text{ pen pals} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24 fries.
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after receiving from Ginger: \(9 + x\) fries.
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:** 
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\).

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final answer:**

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (F + F) \]
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. First, we sum up the fruits for each person:

- Andrea's total fruits: \( 52 \text{ apples} + 24 \text{ bananas} = 76 \)
- Jamal's total fruits: \( 44 \text{ apples} + 48 \text{ bananas} = 92 \)

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.
3. **Time to cook the chicken:** 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the sleeves:**
   The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, and the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. Subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches to find the stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

1. **Cost of Tomato Seeds:**

   - Cost per packet: $40
   - Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

2. **Cost of Celery Seeds:**
   - Number of packets: 80
   - Cost per packet: $30
   - Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
   - Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
   - Total cost for all seeds = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each component and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the number of cards with the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, we find out how many cards are left, which will have the letter D on them:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging both small and large holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- Therefore, the total time for small holes is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- Therefore, the total time for large holes is \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for both small and large holes:
- Total time = time for small holes + time for large holes
- Total time = \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, \(240\) minutes is \(\frac{240}{60} = 4\) hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

**Final Answer:**
4 hours"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be their current sum of ages plus 20 years (10 years for each of them).

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

The total number of spots on all the cobras is:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots on all the mambas is:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Susan earns \(\boxed{75}\) dollars for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their totals:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we sum up the points of all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points are distributed is:

\[
\boxed{83}

"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's sum up the crates sold:

- Weekend sales: 20 crates
- Tuesday sales: 15 crates
- Wednesday sales: 12 crates
- Thursday sales: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   - Each of the 3 other people bids once, and each bid increases by $50 from the previous bid.
   - The first additional bid by another participant: $200 + $50 = $250
   - The second additional bid by another participant: $250 + $50 = $300
   - The third additional bid by another participant: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants, so she bids 3 times.
   - Her first bid: $350 (after the third bid by another participant)
   - Her second bid: $350 + $50 = $400
   - Her third bid: $400 + $50 = $450

"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**

   - Let the number of books sold in the current year (third year) be \(45\).
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \(2 \times 45 = 90\).

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold so far:**
   - The total number of books sold in the first and third years is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
   - There are currently 50 unsold books, which means the total number of books in the collection is \(135 + 50 = 185\).

3. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - The number of books sold in the first and third years is 135.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \(250 - 135 = 115\).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \(115 \times 20 = 2300\).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{2300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:

- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500 \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

So, Watson's total earnings for April are:
\[ 4 \, \text{weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning.

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks).

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from each item and then sum them up.

1. **Savings from ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
   - For 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

2. **Savings from milk:**
   - Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
   - For 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

3. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings = Savings from ice cream + Savings from milk
   - Total savings = $4 + $2 = $6

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over the course of a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

**Final Answer:**
The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \(D\).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \(2D\).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \(\frac{1}{2}D\).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[3.5D = 105\]

To find \(D\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:
\[D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30\]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Then, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is the sum of those who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

\[
8 + 2 = 10
\]

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
4. Each marble weighs 2 kg.

Let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him:
\[ \text{Number of marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 \]

Since each marble weighs 2 kg, the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of People:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **People Who Left:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

3. **People Who Stayed:**
   - Total people who stayed = 40 - 10 = 30

4. **Men Who Stayed:**
   - Given that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Women Who Stayed:**
   - Since the total number of people who stayed is 30 and 22 of them are men, the number of women who stayed is:
   - Women who stayed = 30 - 22 = 8

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is **8**."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs:

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Given that the number of loose pencils is 2, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are in three boxes, we can determine the number of pencils per box:

\[ \text{Number of pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, let's consider the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - To find the number of ice cubes used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling per ice cube:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Effect of Ice Cubes on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}

4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). Adding these to the remaining lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = 40 \, \text{percentage points} \times 3 \, \text{minutes/percentage point} = 120 \, \text{minutes} \]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{120 \, \text{minutes}}{60 \, \text{minutes/hour}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%.

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

1. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - Therefore, for 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \( 30 \, \text{ounces/batch} \times 8 \, \text{batches} = 240 \, \text{ounces} \).

2. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - Therefore, for 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \( 70 \, \text{ounces} \).

3. Add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
   - Total sugar needed = \( 240 \, \text{ounces} + 70 \, \text{ounces} = 310 \, \text{ounces} \).

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. Therefore, the new price per share after the first year is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the second year is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Thus, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate:

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs.
3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:

John ate 3 hot dogs, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs. The difference is \(3 - 2 = 1\).

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of animals is 60.
- The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:
- Total legs from cows: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- Total legs from chickens: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks from when he starts practicing.

So, after 4 weeks, the number of balls he can juggle is:
\[ 3 \text{ balls} + 4 \text{ weeks} \times 1 \text{ ball/week} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is:
\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

After the balls are dropped, 2 are caught, and 1 is lost, Josh is left with:
\[ 4 \text{ balls} - 1 \text{ ball} = 3 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds (given)
2. **Blue Beetle**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. **Red Bird**: 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
- **Blue Beetle**: 50 pounds
- **Green Toad**: 50 pounds
- **Yellow Snake**: 60 pounds
- **Red Bird**: 30 pounds
- **Container**: 20 pounds

"First, let's determine the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day according to his coach's advice. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters. 

To find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, Tyson needs to run an additional 1000 meters each day. Therefore, the new daily distance Tyson should run is:
\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June. June typically has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days, the total distance he covers in June is:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[
180000 \text{ meters}

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."

Step 2: \(50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs}\)

Step 3: \(160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs}\)

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, the total is:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, the total is:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are consumed by them in a week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, Jenny eats:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

\[ \text{Cost per shirt} = \$30 \]
\[ \text{Number of shirts} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 30 \times 2 = \$60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = 40\% \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = \$24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Davos paid:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = 60 - 24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid \(\$36\) for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos. The formula to calculate the percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then we have:

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to ensure that the total points from all three tests sum to at least 42 points.

First, we add the points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 \text{ points (first test)} + 18 \text{ points (second test)} = 33 \text{ points} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach at least 42 points:
\[ 42 \text{ points (total required)} - 33 \text{ points (current total)} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To determine the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY approach and then subtract that from the original market price.

1. Calculate the savings from the DIY approach:
   - The savings is 20% of the original market price.
   - Original market price = $400.
   - Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.

2. Subtract the savings from the original market price to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Original market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Saturday = \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday before returns = \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.
   - Six pairs were returned because they didn't fit.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday after returns = \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

4. **Total pairs sold:**
   - Total pairs sold = Pairs sold on Friday + Pairs sold on Saturday + Pairs sold on Sunday after returns.
   - Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold the apples for $4 each.
   - She got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total money from Monday}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
     \]

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Number of apples on Tuesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   - Add the number of apples picked on each day:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.
- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\).
- Total gold pesos: Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\).

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos:

- Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = \(150 + 200 = 350\).

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we need to determine how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Given that she sells 4 cups per hour, the time to sell 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther initially had.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88

"First, let's calculate the cost for David and Dasha if they buy tickets individually for all 9 rides.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride} \]

For 9 rides, the total cost for tickets would be:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. Therefore, the cost for David is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, let's calculate the difference in cost between buying tickets individually and buying a bracelet.

The cost for Dasha buying tickets for 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David buying a bracelet is $30. The savings for David is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves:

"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

"First, let's determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we calculate how many 2-cup bags of flour Mark needs:
- \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)

Then, we calculate how many 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs:
- \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4\)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   36 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the stripes:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 4 zebras in total. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[
\frac{88}{4} = 22
\]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[
22

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 100 \text{ (corns)} = 200\]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(200\)."
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed by Walking to and from School**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, the number of steps he completed by walking to and from school is:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Additional Steps**: He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog are:
   \[
   5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Steps Left After Jog**: After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means the total steps he had taken before the jog plus the 2,000 steps left should equal his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

**Final Answer:**
20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
   - Number of employees who left = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June = 40 - 10 = 30

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May: $24000
   - Total payment for June: $18000
   - Total payment for both months = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
   \[
   \text{Total payment for both months} = 24000 + 18000 = 42000
   \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00. Therefore, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The total cost is $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us the percentage of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, which is 5%.

Given that Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, we can infer that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. This is because 99% not exploding means 1% do explode.

Now, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are both defective (smell like wet dog) and expected to explode. Since 5% of the candles are defective and 1% of all candles are expected to explode, we need to find the intersection of these two conditions.

First, calculate the number of candles that are defective:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 2,500 defective candles are also expected to explode. Since 1% of all candles are expected to explode, and we are only considering the defective ones, we assume that the defect and the explosion are independent events. Therefore, 1% of the 2,500 defective candles are expected to explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2,500 = 0.01 \times 2,500 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are expected to explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. Given that the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we calculate the discount price as follows:

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6
   \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price:
   \[
   \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:

3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this as \( x \) apples.

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples (since she doesn't take any from the average trees).

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by her sister: \( 60 + 45 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 500 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer:**
350"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtract 124 from both sides:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Peter's locker size**: We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

2. **Zack's locker size**: According to the problem, Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Timothy's locker size**: The problem states that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, the first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is given as $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the sale price, so:
\[ J = 22 + 6 = 28 \]

However, the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since both the original prices are the same ($28), the difference is:
\[ 28 - 28 = 0 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost the same as the tattered jeans, and the difference is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
2. She buys 3 bird feeders.
3. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
4. Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds.
- For the 3 homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds.

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

2. **Additional Guests:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than the initial 36 guests.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the initial 36 guests.
   - Since 4 additional guests showed up, the caterer had to prepare an additional 4 hotdogs for these guests.

3. **Total Hotdogs Needed:**
   - The 40 guests all wanted a second hotdog.
   - The initial 36 guests had already been given their first hotdog, so they would need 36 more hotdogs for their second hotdog.
   - The additional 4 guests would need 4 more hotdogs for their second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for a second hotdog is \(36 + 4 = 40\).

4. **Hotdogs Available:**
   - The caterer had prepared 36 hotdogs initially and then 4 more for the additional guests, totaling \(36 + 4 = 40\) hotdogs.

5. **Hotdogs Shortage:**
   - The total number of hotdogs needed for a second hotdog is 40.
   - The total number of hotdogs available is 40.
   - Therefore, there are no hotdogs short, and all 40 guests can have a second hotdog.

Since the number of hotdogs available matches the number needed, no guests did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
0 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to the 3 letters:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can determine the number of candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces have been eaten. Since the cake was divided equally, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, we need to calculate the total time each person takes to reach the theater and then find the difference.

1. **Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is given as 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time = \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

3. **Arrival time adjustments:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne's total travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's total travel time to the theater is 16 minutes.
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time.

4. **Calculating the difference in departure times:**
   - Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to account for her longer travel time.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth's total is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Margareth's total is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Process**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Therefore, over 3 hours, the temperature increase is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.
   - The temperature after baking is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

3. **Cooling Process**:
   - Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes.
   - The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.
   - In 30 minutes, the cooling effect is \(30 / 10 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.
   - The temperature after opening the window is \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

So, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael will have after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs that were loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of purchasing the case.

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the costs and savings step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown regular price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of popcorn and soda minus the cost of the super ticket equals $2 in savings.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     (\text{Cost of regular ticket} + \text{Cost of popcorn} + \text{Cost of soda}) - \text{Cost of super ticket} = 2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     (12 + x + 3) - 21 = 2
     \]
     Simplifying the equation:
     \[

"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We can calculate this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

Calculating each part separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. For the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days.
2. Add the amounts together to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Each person eats 4 apples a day.
- In 30 days, each person eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Now, let's add the amounts together:
- Marin eats 120 apples.
- Nancy eats 120 apples.
- Together, they eat \(120 + 120 = 240 \text{ apples}\).

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by summing the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

The final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[ 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible positive spot, which is 5th place (since there are only 10 spots in a race).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(5 + 2 = 7\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(7 - 3 = 4\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(4 + 1 = 5\).

So, Finley finished in 5th place.

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student receives 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final payment is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. The discount amount is:

So, Kelly's final payment is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: 2 sheets
2. **Comforter per room**: 1 comforter
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Twice as many as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases
4. **Towels per room**: Twice as many as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels

Now, we sum up the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
\[ 2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room} \]

For 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he receives \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes on Monday.
   - Total shoes after Monday: \(200 + 10 = 210\).

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday**: He gains 15 pairs of shoes.
   - Total shoes after Wednesday: \(210 + (15 \times 2) = 210 + 30 = 240\).

4. **Shoes received on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes.
   - Total shoes after Friday: \(240 + (30 \times 2) = 240 + 60 = 300\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80

Therefore, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book:
\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to distribute these 20 books equally among her 4 kids. We divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. 

The increased cost per day is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

Therefore, Jasper has a total of 11 tubes of paint."
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to determine the weight of each penny and then add them together.

1. **Weight of the 1959 penny:**
   The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

2. **Weight of the 2010 penny:**
   The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

3. **Combined weight of the two pennies:**
   Now, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earnings by 3 pm: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the total earnings from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"

"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs **4 bags** of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find this number by calculating two thirds of 27:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18

"To find out how much Sally spends in total, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so the cost of the family-size pizza is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) dollars.
3. Adding the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza together, we get \(8 + 24 = 32\) dollars.

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts: \( 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \) dollars.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale: \( 4.00 \) dollars (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the sale price.
   - Final cost after the coupon: \( 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors: \( 2 \) packs \(\times\) 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor: \( \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor} \).

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - 1 dollar = 100 cents.
   - 0.25 dollars = \( 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, after all discounts, is **25 cents**."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
- The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Since the shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}\).

\[
60 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 5 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

1. **Morning rides:**
   - Cost per morning ride: $6
   - Number of morning rides per day: 1
   - Number of days: 14
   - Total cost for morning rides: \( 6 \times 1 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars

2. **Afternoon rides:**

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost for morning rides: $84
   - Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
   - Total cost: \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is **$112**."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\):
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

**Final Answer:**
Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[

"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Gifts for the first 2 friends:**
   - Each of these 2 friends wants 5 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 2 friends: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

2. **Gifts for the next 3 friends:**
   - Each of these 3 friends wants 2 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 3 friends: \(3 \times 2 = 6\)

3. **Additional random gifts:**
   - Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.
   - Total additional gifts: \(10\)

Now, we sum up all the gifts:
\[10 \text{ (for the first 2 friends)} + 6 \text{ (for the next 3 friends)} + 10 \text{ (additional random gifts)} = 26\]

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 popsicle sticks, and each costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40/\text{day} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's consider the cost with the weekly bus pass. The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

To find out how much Janet would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the combined total number of animals in the farm and the zoo is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, we calculate the number of onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation for the onions:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \times 4 = 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation for the potatoes:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \times 4 = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days

Next, calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:

Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she will run 2 km, the total amount of water she needs is:
\[ 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 2 \, \text{km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, after buying CDs, Julie had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which amount to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which amount to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars}\]

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each individual:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Next, we sum the rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   - Her new weekly cost is:
     \[
     98 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147/\text{week}
     \]

Finally, let's find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \$147/\text{week} - \$126/\text{week} = \$21/\text{week}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 10 days is double the time to paint half a house).

Next, we need to find out the rate at which 5 people can paint a house. Since 5 people working together would paint 5 times faster than one person, they can paint a whole house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equivalent to \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48"
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then the number of chairs she has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Ophelia and Jenna have the same number of sofas as chairs (as stated in the problem), the number of sofas Jenna has is also 66.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 66 = 86 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 86 + 88 = 174 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{174} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[
\text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount without headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
   \[
   1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:** 48

2. **First stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 8
   - **Passengers getting on:** 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\)

   After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 21
   - **Passengers getting on:** 3 times fewer than the number who got off, which is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\)

   After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of one monitor. Let the cost of one monitor be \( M \). Then the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \) dollars."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as \( G \).

Given that the boys brought 60 seashells each, the girls brought:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

Calculating the expression:
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

\[ \text{Candies Nick had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Nick has 16 candies."
"To find Anne's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Alyana's age.
2. Use Alyana's age to find Anne's age.

First, we know Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we calculate Alyana's age as follows:
\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we calculate Anne's age as follows:
\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

So, Emma has made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left. Therefore, the amount he had after tripling is:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of April. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Additional commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Additional commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Additional commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a warm day.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold and a warm day.

On a cold day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a warm day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time on a cold day from the time on a warm day:

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is \(180\) pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time Elapsed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of the Sun**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Movement} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground is the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   \text{Final Angle} = 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is **82 degrees**."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the second son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs a number of candles equal to their age, we add the ages of both sons:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time by the reading rate:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches consumed:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final answer:

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each of the three teenagers: Richie, Mark, and Anna.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Given: Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20.
   - Mark's goals = 80 - 20 = 60.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45.
   - Anna's goals = 80 - 45 = 35.

4. **Total Goals:**
   - To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum up the goals scored by each.
   - Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals.
   - Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."

"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. Since he started with $70 and spent $40 from Sunday to Wednesday, the remaining amount is:

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he can buy with $40 is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Compare the total number of roses Ford grows in a month with the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.**

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. Therefore, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.**

We assume an average month has 4 weeks.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.**

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.**

Ford needs to supply 65 roses per week to the flower shops. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he needs to supply:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 5: Determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.**

Ford grows 160 roses in a month but needs 260 roses to supply the flower shops. Therefore, the number of roses Ford lacks is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \text{ roses} \]

**Final Answer:**
Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 24 months. Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 100 \times 24 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:

"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a target of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% off.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):

\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = 1.04x \]

We know the actual temperature should be 520 degrees:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Adding the 5 minutes gives:
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. We can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- Number of red jelly beans = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Weight change from eating Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\).

2. **Weight change from eating donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\).

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - The difference in weight change between eating donuts and Cheerios is \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\).

Therefore, at the end of 5 weeks, Martin will be 15 pounds heavier if he eats donuts for breakfast compared to eating Cheerios."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8 + 8 = 16\) (8 friends + 8 spouses).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - People invited via email: 100
   - Additional people invited by email: 200
   - People invited via phone: 10
   - Additional people from phone invitations: 16

Adding all these together:
\[ 100 + 200 + 10 + 16 = 326 \]

Therefore, Alex will need **326 seats**."
"Let's break down the weights step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can determine how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then sum them up.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given the store has:
- 5 dogs
- 2 cats
- 10 birds

We can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

1. Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour} \).

For the first four hours, his total earnings were:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour} \).

For the next two hours, his total earnings were:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - Therefore, the number of subsequent months is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - Each of these subsequent months costs 50% more than the previous month.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - This pattern continues, with each month's cost being 1.5 times the previous month's cost.

To find the total cost for the 45 subsequent months, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]
where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms.

Here, \(a = 150,000\), \(r = 1.5\), and \(n = 45\).

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.5^{45}\):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,148,698.13 \]

So,
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,148,698.13 - 1) \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,148,697.13 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 344,609,139,000 \]

Finally, adding the initial 5 months' cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 344,609,139,000 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 344,609,139,100 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[ \boxed{344,609,139,100} \]"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. The number of seats remaining after the administrators have taken their seats is:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights per intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ times}
   \]

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ times}
   \]

3. Adding the remaining play times of both DVDs gives us the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break:

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert Ashley's speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck during the week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Calculate the height difference:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total earnings for the first month.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second month.
4. Sum the earnings from both months to get the total amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Determine the amount earned from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne earned $400 from red hats.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the amount earned from green hats is \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings for the first month:**
   - Total earnings for the first month = earnings from red hats + earnings from green hats
   - Total earnings for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the earnings for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Earnings for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Sum the earnings from both months:**
   - Total earnings for two months = earnings from the first month + earnings from the second month
   - Total earnings for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\)."
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he effectively pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

Therefore, James paid $75."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount received to find the amount withheld.

First, we find out how much money Sally received this week. Her bank account started with $200 and now has $420. The difference between these amounts is the total money received this week:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. Since she received $220, the difference between her expected wage and the amount she received is the amount that was withheld:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount of money withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes (pork) + 30 minutes (rice) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans.
   - Total cooking time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
120 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to cover the additional 8 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to cover the additional 12 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after the second purchase.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is given by:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode and then calculate the total time based on his experimental mowing pattern.

1. **Determine the mowing rates:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
     \]
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time for each half of the lawn:**
   - For the first half of the lawn mowed in ""turtle"" mode:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ half lawn}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}}} = \frac{1 \text{ half lawn}}{\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - For the second half of the lawn mowed in ""rabbit"" mode:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ half lawn}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}}} = \frac{1 \text{ half lawn}}{\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time Chris took to mow the entire lawn is the sum of the time taken for each half:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have.

1. Total time available: 30 minutes
2. Time taken to the corner (library): 6 minutes
3. Time taken from the corner to the fire station: 13 minutes

First, we add the time taken to the corner and the time taken from the corner to the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples**: 
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4.

2. **Bananas**: 
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges**: 
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

After baking, they eat 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the final number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of the individuals are 44, so we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are the same age, we have:
\[ T_1 = T_2 \]

Substituting \( T_2 \) with \( T_1 \) in the combined ages equation, we get:
\[ T_1 + T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know that:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

Substituting \( P_1 \) with \( T_1 - 7 \) in the combined ages equation, we get:
\[ 2T_1 + (T_1 - 7) + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3T_1 - 7 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3T_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 51 \]

Since \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) are the ages of the other two triplets, and assuming they are the same age as \( P_1 \) (as no other information is given to suggest otherwise), we can write:
\[ P_2 = P_1 = T_1 - 7 \]
\[ P_3 = P_1 = T_1 - 7 \]

Substituting \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) with \( T_1 - 7 \) in the equation, we get:
\[ 3T_1 + (T_1 - 7) + (T_1 - 7) = 51 \]
\[ 3T_1 + T_1 - 7 + T_1 - 7 = 51 \]
\[ 5T_1 - 14 = 51 \]
\[ 5T_1 = 65 \]
\[ T_1 = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Now, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong and Neil over these 120 months.

For Rong:

\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

For Neil:

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total coins} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1.0\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = 5.0\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6.0\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = 3.0\) dollars.

"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. Given that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2. Therefore, the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 20 \text{ drinks} \times 2 \text{ dollars per drink} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \text{ snacks} \times 2 \text{ dollars per snack} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount spent is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 800 \, \text{pounds} = 4,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 4,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8,800 pounds from 11,600 pounds:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} - 8,800 \, \text{pounds} = 2,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]
So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage.
The total city usage is 40%, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes, so the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total to find the final bill:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

**Final Answer: 14**"
"First, calculate the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft}
\]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet.

\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost for picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Price per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Price per pound × Pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine the original planned price per computer. The company had $700 planned for each computer. 

The new price per computer is 10% higher than the planned price. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wants to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Given that 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews get a job offer:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ people} \]

Finally, we determine how many of those who receive a job offer accept it. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept it:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is:

\[8 - 4 = 4\]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \, \text{taps}\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \, \text{taps}\)

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends) who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[

"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's sum up the weights:

- Math books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 math books)
- Science books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 science books)
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds

"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

2. Students who like to bake: 10
3. Students who like to play basketball: 5
4. The rest like to play video games or play music.
5. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number that like to play basketball.

First, we calculate the number of students who like to play music:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times \text{Number of students who like to play basketball} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who like to play video games. We know the total number of students and the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games can be found by subtracting the number of students who like the other activities from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = \text{Total number of students} - (\text{Number of students who like to bake} + \text{Number of students who like to play basketball} + \text{Number of students who like to play music}) \]
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. 

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This leaves:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the 8 that remained. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

**Final Answer: 28**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in both classes**: 80 students.
2. **Number of students in each class**: Since the two classes have the same number of students, each class has \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) students.
3. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40% of the students in each class are girls.
4. **Number of girls in each class**: 40% of 40 students is \( 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \) girls.
5. **Number of boys in each class**: Since each class has 40 students in total and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is \( 40 - 16 = 24 \).

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \( \boxed{24} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the total number of slices now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so the final number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's calculate the total number of grooming jobs Melissa has for the week:

- Dogs to be bathed: 8
- Cats to have their nails clipped: 5
- Birds to have their wings trimmed: 3
- Horses to be brushed: 12

Total grooming jobs = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

28 grooming jobs ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards he received. He received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, plus 30 more cards each worth $50 on average. The total value of the 30 additional cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Therefore, the daily savings is $0.10 * 500 = $50.

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

To find Cal's marbles, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas**: Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. **Arnold steals half**: Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, after Arnold steals, Gunther has:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas**: Gunther adds 25 more bananas to his pile.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas**: Arnold steals 12 bananas from the pile.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas**: Gunther adds 6 more bananas to his pile.

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the initial number of glasses and plates Jeff sent for the event.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12 items, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

- Total glasses: \(8 \times 12 = 96\)
- Total plates: \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken. According to the problem, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, we subtract these from the initial amounts:

- Remaining glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\)
- Remaining plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\)

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: \(86 + 42 = 128\)

Therefore, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers left and \(40 + 27 = 67\) large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 67 = 33.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(67 - 33 = 34\) large stickers left and \(67 + 33 = 100\) large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 34 large stickers = \(34 \times 3 = 102\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(100 + 102 = 202\) large buttons.

5. **Final Count of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 202 large buttons and no small buttons left.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{202}

"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. Since the problem asks for a final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{1000}{7}} \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can find the number of pears by calculating 45% of the number of bananas and then adding that to the number of bananas.

Given that George has 200 bananas, we calculate 45% of 200:

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Therefore, the total number of pears is:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

\[ 200 \text{ (bananas)} + 290 \text{ (pears)} = 490 \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

"Let's break down the scoring for both Ava and Emma based on the given information:

1. **Enemies Jumped On:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10 points.
   - If Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, then Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points from enemies for Emma = \( 10E \).
   - Points from enemies for Ava = \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \).

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5 points.
   - If Emma collects \( B \) berries, then Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points from berries for Emma = \( 5B \).
   - Points from berries for Ava = \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \).

3. **Time Left on the Timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left = 30 points.
   - If Emma has \( T \) seconds left, then Ava has \( T + 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points from time for Emma = \( 30T \).
   - Points from time for Ava = \( 30(T + 4) = 30T + 120 \).

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \):

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Isolate \( W \):

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first phase:

- Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
- Therefore, in the first phase, Kris plays \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the second phase:

- Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in the second phase, Kris plays \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both phases to find the total hours played so far:

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

So, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

**Final Answer:**
20 miles"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \)

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:

- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)
- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 680 \)

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - Each bag contains 72 glass chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   \[
   \text{Total glass chips} = 72 \times 2 = 144
   \]

2. **Determine the number of glass chips needed per square inch:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic.

3. **Calculate the total area of the mosaic Milo can make with the available glass chips:**
   \[
   \text{Total area} = \frac{\text{Total glass chips}}{\text{Glass chips per square inch}} = \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the height of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.

5. **Calculate the length of the mosaic:**
   - Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches and the height is 3 inches, the length can be found by dividing the total area by the height.
   \[
   \text{Length} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Height}} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[48 \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after the second order: \(100 \text{ (initial)} + 100 \text{ (additional)} = 200 \text{ candies}\)
2. Number of candies sold: 150

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

\[200 - 150 = 50\]

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **End of January**: The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
3. **End of February**: The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
4. **End of March**: The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
5. **End of April**: The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
6. **End of May**: The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find the additional number of students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the end of May: 320
- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10

The additional number of students that joined by the end of May is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
3. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time each person can play in 4 hours (240 minutes):

- Jack: \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters
- Each of the two friends: \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) quarters
- The better friend: \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[ 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \]

So, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is:

\[ 68 \times 0.25 = 17 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We can substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation for \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. \]

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ o + s + z + z + s = 10. \]
Substituting \( s = 2z \) and \( o = 4z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + 2z + z + z + 2z = 10. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 10z = 10. \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 1. \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4. \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to:

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars he no longer has is the sum of the cars he sold and the cars he gave away:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money was raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. So, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy walked over the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. We need to calculate the cost for the additional items:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:

$129.00 (base installation) + $30.00 (additional mirrors) + $15.00 (additional chandelier) + $150.00 (additional pictures) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches high.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches high.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches high.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of distances from both segments: \( 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \)

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance across the highway, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( S \).
   - The time taken by 3 kangaroos to travel the distance \( D \) is 18 hours.
   - Since they are traveling at the same speed, the time taken by one kangaroo to travel the distance \( D \) is also 18 hours.
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is \( S = \frac{D}{18} \).

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{36} \).

3. **Calculate the time taken by four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The time taken by one turtle to travel the distance \( D \) is \( \frac{D}{\frac{D}{36}} = 36 \) hours.
   - Since the turtles are traveling at the same speed and independently, the time taken by four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is also 36 hours.

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway is \(\boxed{36}\) hours."
"First, let's determine the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we add up the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora to find the total number of dishes they all made together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the new laptop is $600.
2. By trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gave her $80. So, the total amount from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
5. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has is \( x + 230 \).
6. We know that \( x + 230 = 350 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars. The hat cost $70. Therefore, the change she received is \(80 - 70 = 10\) dollars.

The change Thea received is $10."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter's socks are \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter's dishes are \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students in the other categories:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good in English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand how simple interest works. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

In this case, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, let's determine the annual interest rate. The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

This means that each year, Brenda earns $225 in interest. Now, we can calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the total interest to the original principal:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total White Shirts and Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Total Floral Shirts and Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

3. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Since 20 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - Since 20 floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the sum of all ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. With 50 students each receiving 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos (students)} + 20 \text{ burritos (Mr. George)} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Since Mr. George ordered 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars + Number of yellow cars

75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + Number of yellow cars

Now, let's calculate the number of yellow cars:

Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the weight of the sweet potatoes.
2. Use the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

First, we know that the bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds. The bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."

"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays per month is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, the amount Keenan pays per month is:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount Keenan pays by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."

"First, let's break down the costs of each item:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

2. On Wednesdays, the shop also makes 125 chimichangas.
3. On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the thingamabob:**
   - We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
   - Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ m/s}}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the whirligig:**
   - We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.
   - Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ m/s} = 55 \text{ m/s}

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

1. **Cost of the salad**: $6
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. **Total cost of the salad and yogurt**: $6 + $3 = $9.

Given that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily diet, we can find the total cost of the carrots by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost.

4. **Total cost of the carrots**: $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we can find the cost of one carrot by dividing the total cost of the carrots by 2.

5. **Cost of one carrot**: $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
2. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each time she mowed his lawn.

First, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn:
\[ \text{Earnings from Joe's lawn} = 6J \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
\[ \text{Earnings from Kamala's lawn} = 6 \times 3J = 18J \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Alba's lawn} = 6 \times 5J = 30J \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month were $80. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 54J + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade, we need to determine the value of \( J \). Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is $54J, we can isolate the earnings from lemonade:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54J \]

To find \( J \), we need to consider that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6 (since each mowing pays $6). The only value of \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a feasible part of $80 is \( J = 1 \) (since \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) and \( 80 - 54 = 26 \)).

Thus, the earnings from lemonade are:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. Therefore, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car each month is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

Therefore, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the adults. The two children will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the children. In total, they will consume 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls of soup.

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and they will consume 4 bowls, there will be no soup left over for the children to have additional bowls for lunch. 

Therefore, each child will be able to have 0 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

0"
"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50. Since William bought five notebooks, the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]

2. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. Since William bought one ballpen, the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]

3. Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - For 20 small masks, the total material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total material for small masks} = 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - For 8 large masks, the total material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total material for large masks} = 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total material needed:**
   - Adding the material needed for the small and large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought:**

   - \( \frac{216}{27} = 8 \).

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is \( \$8 \)."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ (working)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes out of the 7 he has. Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his 9 red shoe boxes. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Finally, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles he gave away from his original amount:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm size = 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm = 2 * 200 acres = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm size = 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm size + Farmer Smith's farm size
Total acres = 200 acres + 500 acres
Total acres = 700 acres.

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. This is calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing these 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( Y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

We also know that \( R = 20 \). Substituting \( R \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**
   - Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the hours worked on Wednesday = \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

3. **Thursday:**
   - Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the hours worked on Thursday = \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
- Total hours = Hours on Tuesday + Hours on Wednesday + Hours on Thursday
- Total hours = \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
\]

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \).

Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + x = 9
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[
2x = 9
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Thus, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make is:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries picked per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, then over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. So, the remaining amount he has is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining amount he has is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can buy one more ticket.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see this month is:
\[5 + 8 + 1 = 14\] movies.

Final numerical answer:

4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find the number of bouncy balls:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

**Final numerical answer:**
14"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, her mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons.

First, calculate the total number of balloons given by Maria initially:
- Maria gave 2 balloons to each of her 4 friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
- Maria had 1 balloon for herself: \(1\) balloon.

So, the total number of balloons given by Maria is:
\[8 + 1 = 9\]

Next, calculate the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom:
- Her mom gave 3 balloons to each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria): \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, add the balloons given by Maria and her mom to find the total number of balloons:
\[9 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney combined:
- Total distance = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants:
- Number of participants: 2
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the initial 12-hour stay cost:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall total. The total hay needed is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for his expenses. He spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} \times 5 \, \text{pencils} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we sum these charges:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining 40% of the distance (since he has already swum 60%):

\[ 0.40 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining 8 miles at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17 \text{ hours}} \]"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70 loaves.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:

\[ \text{Number of loaves the bakery has} = 7 \times (\text{Number of loaves Sam had last Friday}) - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had last Friday (70) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of loaves the bakery has} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

First, we calculate \(7 \times 70\):

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{450} \]"

"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies.

\[ \text{Commission per New York Times} = 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]
\[ \text{Total commission from New York Times} = 0.50 \times 6 = 3.00 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies.

\[ \text{Commission per Wall Street Journal} = 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]
\[ \text{Total commission from Wall Street Journal} = 1.20 \times 10 = 12.00 \]

**Step 3: Total Commission**
\[ \text{Total commission} = 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo’s age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus’s age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar scored.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement by Courtney.

1. Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).
2. According to Courtney, the number of people was 48, which is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   48 = x + 0.20x
   \]
3. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   48 = 1.20x
   \]
4. To find \( x \), divide both sides by 1.20:
   \[
   x = \frac{48}{1.20}
   \]
5. Perform the division:
   \[
   x = 40
   \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.**

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.**

After filling in two holes:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

**Step 3: Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.**

Number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 10 \]

Number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.**

"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We sum the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net southerly distance by subtracting the northerly distance from the southerly distance:

- Total southerly distance: \( 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles} \)
- Total northerly distance: \( 36 \, \text{miles} \)

Net southerly distance:
\[ 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{374} \, \text{miles} \]"
"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

1. **Initial Batch:**
   Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Office Party:**
   She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Surprise Party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Received:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (office party)} + 48 \text{ (surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies Eaten:**
   During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies Left Over:**
   Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total brownies received:
   \[
   66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (brownies eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\) years. Therefore, the sister's age is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (one for himself, one for his wife, and one for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is:
\[ \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$300 = \$600 \]

Adding the costs together, the total amount John paid for all 4 phones is:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ 120 \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
\[ G_S = 10 \]
\[ A_S = A_U - 4 \]
\[ G_U = G_S + 5 \]
\[ A_U = 15 \]

Now, substitute the known values into the equations:
\[ G_S = 10 \]
\[ A_U = 15 \]
\[ G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \]
\[ A_S = 15 - 4 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- Gingerbread cost $6 per box.
- Apple pie cost $15 per box.

Earnings on Saturday:
\[ \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = G_S \times 6 = 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from apple pie} = A_S \times 15 = 11 \times 15 = 165 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 60 + 165 = 225 \]

Earnings on Sunday:
\[ \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = G_U \times 6 = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from apple pie} = A_U \times 15 = 15 \times 15 = 225 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 90 + 225 = 315 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to get the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings for two days} = 225 + 315 = 540 \]

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{540}\) dollars for the two days."

"To find the cost of the red car, we start by calculating 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the red car is 40% cheaper, we subtract this amount from the price of the blue car:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is:

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
     - Let the age of Emil's dad at that time be \(D\).
     - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
     - Let the age of Emil's brother at that time be \(B\).
     - Therefore, \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

3. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.
   - Similarly, his brother will be \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} + 6 \text{ (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
7

"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy and how much money she will spend, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \) foot.
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Total space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant is \( 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) feet.

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed:**
   - The number of plants that can fit is \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \).

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00\)
- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. With 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. With 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

Since the total bag of soil is 30 pounds, the remaining soil for planting roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, with 3 pounds of soil remaining, they can plant \(3 \div 1 = 3\) roses.

**Final Answer:**
3 roses"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of sets} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
     \]
   - Since each set takes 10 minutes, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Now, we add the time required for peeling and sautering:
\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is:
\[ 18 - 4 = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency and number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are four quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
52

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's break down the howling durations for each wolf:

1. **Tobias** howls for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote** howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous** howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

However, the problem also mentions that Walter's friend will give him an additional $200. This amount is not part of the lawyer's contribution but rather a separate donation. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution remains:

\[ 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for his appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
   - Total cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Daily earnings = Total cost per session * Number of sessions per day
   - Daily earnings = $40 * 3 = $120

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of days the studio is rented in a month is 4 weeks * 3 days/week = 12 days.
   - Monthly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a month

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.

**Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of baby porcupines born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.**

There are 12 months in a year. The total number of baby porcupines born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Therefore, the total number of porcupines after a year is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, 8260 gallons of water are needed to fill the pool.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to determine the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:

     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \( \boxed{94\%} \)."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. Therefore, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Anne gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends equally, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \( \boxed{139} \) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums are exclusively selfies and 2 albums are exclusively portraits. This means the remaining albums are a mix of both selfies and portraits. Since there are 8 albums in total:

\[ 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 \]

So, there are 3 albums that contain both selfies and portraits.

Now, we calculate the total number of selfies. Since 3 albums are exclusively selfies and each album contains 9 pictures:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

So, there are 27 selfies.

Next, we calculate the total number of portraits. Since 2 albums are exclusively portraits and each album contains 9 pictures:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, there are 18 portraits.

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests.
5. **Additional Checkins After Dinner**: 7 more people checked in after dinner.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- **Guests after early checkouts**: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- **Guests after late checkouts**: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- **Guests after afternoon checkins**: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- **Guests after additional checkins**: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is **98**."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of remaining questions: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- These remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions.
- Number of average questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
- Number of difficult questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  24 \times 0.75 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ average questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ difficult questions correct}
  \]

Now, we sum the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

\[
18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36
\]

Therefore, Aries is sure to get \(\boxed{36}\) points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \). Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

- Earnings from cookies: \(80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80\)
- Earnings from cupcakes: \(60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240\)

Adding these together gives the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to subtract the amount given to her two sisters:
\[ \$320 - (2 \times \$10) = \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

This means that the number of eggs left to be found by the friends is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This implies that 10 eggs were not found by the friends. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the friends found:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day:
\[
40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:
\[
1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

1. **First Package:**
   - 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars.

2. **Second Package:**
   - 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

3. **Third Package:**
   - 8 sandwiches.
   - Cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars.

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the net cost of the bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. The original cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old one for $1000. Therefore, the net cost is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given a substitute teacher: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher gives an extension: 0%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher does not give an extension: 100% or 1

4. **Marcus Convincing the Teacher:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability that Marcus convinces the teacher: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given he convinces the teacher: 0%

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, giving an extension, and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.4 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus having to turn in his homework: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 1 = 0.3\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, Marcus convincing the teacher, and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 \times 0 = 0\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework:

\[0 + 0 + 0.3 + 0 = 0.3\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[0.3 \times 100 = 30\%\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **30%**."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. Therefore, the number of seats available for guests is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans that correspond to the number of large jelly beans that fill him up.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat \(\boxed{450}\) small jelly beans."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her net earnings per hour by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Therefore, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To set off all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 transitions (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ transitions} \times 5 \text{ seconds/transition} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has:

- Each box contains 40 apples.
- Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes.

So, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, determine how many packs of apples he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ apples}}{8 \text{ apples/pack}} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds. Therefore, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds. Therefore, the cost for the Mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50 cash. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of cash:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent and lost.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / Annual income after college = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Calculation: \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Win: $11

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Calculation: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Loss: $16.5

Now, let's sum up the total amount lost and won to find the net loss.

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3).

- Average loss: \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\)

Therefore, the average loss per race is $3.5.

\[
\boxed{3.5}

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America: There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).
2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the heights are initially given in inches and feet.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:

**Final Answer:**
Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved \( x = 6 \) balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n \) is 3 years.

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the retention rate: \( 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \)
2. Apply the retention rate for 3 years: \( 20000 \times 0.79^3 \)

Now, let's do the math:

\[ 20000 \times 0.79^3 = 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can follow these steps:

2. Calculate the number of German books:
   - 10% of the 50 books are in German.
   - Number of German books = \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \).

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books:
   - The rest of the books are in Spanish.
   - Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - Number of English books - Number of German books.
   - Number of Spanish books = \( 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \).

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. 

The total distance driven so far is:
\[ 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km} \]

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive:
\[ \boxed{655} \, \text{km} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week, so 4 twin sheets per week.
- 1 king size bed every week, so 1 king sheet per week.

In a year (52 weeks), the total number of sheets used is:
- Twin sheets: \(4 \times 52 = 208\)
- King sheets: \(1 \times 52 = 52\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do based on the machine's capacity:
- The machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
- The machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \div 2 = 104\) loads

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \div 1 = 52\) loads

Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the following equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[2D = 80\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."

"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's break down the cost calculation:

1. **Cost without promotion:**
   - Without any promotion, 6 pounds of butter would cost \(6 \times \$4.00 = \$24.00\).

2. **Cost with promotion:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - Therefore, for every 1.5 pounds of butter, he pays for 1 pound at full price and 0.5 pounds at half price.
   - The cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is \(1 \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - To get 6 pounds of butter, he needs to buy 4.5 pounds (since 6 pounds is equivalent to 4.5 pounds at the promotion rate of 1.5 pounds per unit cost).
   - The cost for 4.5 pounds of butter is \(4.5 \times \$6.00 / 1.5 = 3 \times \$6.00 = \$18.00\).

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is \(\$18.00\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is a fixed fee of $125. Additionally, there is a charge of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the fixed fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas:
\[ 315 - (24 \times 7) = 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. Since the 147 bananas are the total for the week, we divide by 7 to find the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed an additional 500 pieces.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so the total amount of money she has is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot make the purchase and will not receive any change.

Thus, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20 = 30).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 35 minutes after it arrives (30 + 5 = 35).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at the same time it arrives.
   - Arrives at 95 minutes (35 + 60 = 95).

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs.
   - Departs 115 minutes after the first train arrives (95 + 20 = 115).

Paul will board the fourth train at 115 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 115 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 \]
\[ = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 \]
\[ = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 \]
\[ = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount amount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(10\%\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 3600 seconds
   - 4 hours = 4 × 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - 5 × 14400 = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is **72000**."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, let's calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).
3. **Realization and return**: James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. **Total distance walked**: James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, totaling \( 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ miles} \).
5. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

**Final answer:**
1 hour"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total length of the fence:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales over the 6-hour period.

1. **Bales produced by the farmer per hour:** 5 bales
2. **Bales picked up by the truck per hour:** 3 bales

The net change in the number of bales per hour is:
\[ 5 \text{ bales} - 3 \text{ bales} = 2 \text{ bales} \]

Over a 6-hour day, the total net change in the number of bales is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ \text{Total class time per day} = 8 \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

\[ \text{Total class time per week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \text{Extra learning time per week} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

\[ \text{Total learning time per week} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Total learning time per week in hours} = \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \( 72 \) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags sold.**

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. There are 2 shaken sodas left out of a total of 8 sodas.

The probability is calculated as:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

So, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days Billy works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days:
\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."

   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the price of the set of towels after the discount is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **New Balance Calculation:**
   Adding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Each of these 25 cm parts is then to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since the total population is 600 and 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

The number of girls is:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}\]

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}\]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount of apples left for Jacques (and James, assuming James is Jacques) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He then spent $5 on a comic book.
4. He spent another $19 on a puzzle.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Raymond had after saving from his allowance:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since the 2 books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the blinking rate per minute:
\[
\text{Blinking rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We use the blinking rate to set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
\]

Now, perform the division:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[
\boxed{9 \text{ minutes}}

"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's pond:

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- Initial female goldfishes: 5

Next, we add the new fish Tate buys:

- New male guppies: 2
- New female guppies: 1
- New male goldfishes: 2
- New female goldfishes: 3

Now, we calculate the total number of each type of fish after the purchase:

- Total male guppies: 4 (initial) + 2 (new) = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (new) = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (new) = 8

Next, we find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we calculate how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's time.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time = Amalia's time + more than 4 hours.
   - The problem does not specify exactly how much longer, but it states ""well over 4 hours,"" so we can assume the minimum ""well over"" is 5 hours (since ""well over"" implies more than 4 but not significantly more).
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 5 hours = 9 hours.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Now, we sum the times for all three individuals:
   - Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
   - Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = 19 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."

   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance driven in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits
   - Total distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days can be calculated by dividing the distance Sofie walks by 2:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order, which will help us find the production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production of these four workers during their 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total production of these four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total production of the four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys short of the order.

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \text{Toys per hour} = \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"

1. **Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 for herself.**
   - This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.

2. **Luis gave the rest of his stickers to Kris.**
   - Since Kris received all of Luis's stickers, Luis must have had 16 stickers.

3. **Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris.**
   - This means Luis had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers before using half.

4. **Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.**
   - This means Seth had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers before giving half to Luis.

Therefore, Seth had **64 stickers** in the beginning."

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
     \[
     120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
     \[
     600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph}
     \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the third equation into the second equation to find \(S\):
\[C + S = 30\]
\[(S + 12) + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now, we can find \(C\):
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Next, we know that the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the length of the logs John can get from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from these 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each of these logs, he cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.

"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

Final answer:
\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) is:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times 40 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, 18 scoops will require: 
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   - Total eggs for 30 days = \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. **Next 30 days:**
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day.
   - Total eggs for the next 30 days = \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Total eggs for 60 days:**
   - Total eggs = \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. **Convert eggs to dozens:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9 \times 6 = 54\)

Next, we need to account for the 20 women who alight from the bus at the next stop. The number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket
The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners
The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham owns 80 square meters of land.
   - He sold half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - Therefore, the price per square meter for the first sale is \( \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \) dollars per square meter.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - Therefore, the price per square meter for the second sale is \( \frac{30}{10} = 3 \) dollars per square meter.

3. **Third Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money earned from the third sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - From the first sale: $50.
   - From the second sale: $30.
   - From the third sale: $90.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Does not produce any fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{2350}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

\[ \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

Now, we add the amount given by Sophia to the amount Jack originally had:

\[ \text{Jack's total amount} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) into the first relationship to express \( R \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides to isolate the term with \( Y \):
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and after giving $3 to his little sister, he is left with:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ \text{Additional pods} = 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{240}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the original 5-inch piece, and then calculate how many days he can continue to use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage and the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).
   - The chalk usage per day is 20% of the remaining chalk, so the chalk left after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.
   - We need to find the number of days \( n \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches.

   The remaining chalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as:
   \[
   C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n
   \]
   We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
   \[
   2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2
   \]

3. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{8}{11}
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
   \[
   \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
   \]
   \[
   n \ln(0.8) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
   \]
   Since \(\ln(0.8)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.8)\) and reverse the inequality:
   \[
   n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.8)}
   \]
   Calculating the values:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.3365
   \]
   \[
   \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231
   \]
   \[
   n > \frac{-0.3365}{-0.2231} \approx 1.508
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n = 2
   \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls who are on varsity.

1. **Calculate the number of girls on varsity:**

   - Number of girls = 12.
   - Girls on varsity = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\).

2. **Calculate the number of boys on varsity:**
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys = 12.
   - Boys on varsity = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\).

3. **Calculate the total number of students on varsity:**
   - Total students on varsity = Girls on varsity + Boys on varsity.
   - Total students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7.

4. **Calculate the total number of students in the class:**
   - Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls.
   - Total students = 12 + 12 = 24.

5. **Calculate the number of students not on varsity:**
   - Students not on varsity = Total students - Total students on varsity.
   - Students not on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17.

**Final Answer:**
17 students are not on varsity."

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then calculate what percentage of James' total teeth this represents.

1. **Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth the dentist caps:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Total teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is:
50%"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

The amount of milk that passed the expiry date is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the 1600 gallons of returned milk is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = \frac{1600 \times 35}{10} = \frac{56000}{10} = 5600
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by moving all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

The number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each set of 100 books is bought for $500, and he can buy 54 sets, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the money is distributed equally among 3 schools, the number of books per school is:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Therefore, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one into the tree.

2. **First Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket, throwing the remaining one back at the tree.

3. **Second Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple back at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first throw, he picked up 5 apples, but he put 4 in his pocket, so he added 4 to his count.
- After the second throw, he picked up 6 apples and added all 6 to his count.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 \text{ (initially in pocket)} + 4 \text{ (after first throw)} + 6 \text{ (after second throw)} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

And since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per 15 Minutes:**
   - In 15 minutes, Jay builds 20/4 = 5 snowballs (since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour).
   - Out of these, 2 snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net gain in snowballs every 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

4. **Total Snowballs Needed:**
   - Jay needs 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to get 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net gain per 15 minutes.
   - \( \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{3 \text{ snowballs per 15 minutes}} = 20 \text{ intervals} \).

6. **Convert Intervals to Hours:**
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, 20 intervals equal \( 20 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Convert minutes to hours: \( \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and assuming the current year is the year of the 20th anniversary, we need to find out how many years have passed since its first year. However, the exact starting year is not provided, but we can use the current age of John to find the answer.

2. **Determine John's age at the time Digimon came out:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - Let's denote the number of years since Digimon came out as \( x \).
   - Therefore, John's age when Digimon came out was \( 28 - x \).

3. **Determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.
   - Let's denote Jim's age when Digimon came out as \( y \).
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( 28 - x = 2y \).

4. **Determine the current age of Jim:**
   - Since \( x \) years have passed since Digimon came out, Jim's current age is \( y + x \).

5. **Solve for \( y \) using the information that John is 28 now:**
   - We know \( 28 - x = 2y \).
   - We also know that \( x \) years have passed, so \( y + x \) is Jim's current age.

6. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Since John is 28 now, and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     28 - x = 2y
     \]
   - We need to find \( y \) and \( x \) such that the equation holds true.

7. **Solve the equation:**
   - Let's assume \( x = 14 \) (since 28 - 14 = 14, and 14 is half of 28, fitting the condition that John was twice as old as Jim).
   - Then, \( 28 - 14 = 14 \), so \( 2y = 14 \).
   - Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = 7 \).

8. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim's current age is \( y + x = 7 + 14 = 21 \).

Therefore, Jim is currently 21 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since the number of bandages cannot be negative, this means they ran out of bandages and needed to order more. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and the usage for the day, so they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and the usage for the second day.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(16 - 28 = -12\)
   - Again, they ordered 50 more to cover the deficit and the usage, so they ordered 50 bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: Half a bulk pack = 25
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day must be adjusted to account for the deficit from the second day. They started with \(97 - 19 = 78\) (since they had 78 at the end and used 19 more than they had at the end of the second day).

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"First, calculate the cost of the haircut. The difference in hair length is \(10 - 8 = 2\) inches. The cost per inch for the haircut is $30, so the cost for the haircut is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

Next, add the cost of the color, which is $40.

The total cost is \(60 + 40 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
100"
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: \(6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00\)
2. For doing his laundry: \(1 \times \$3.00 = \$3.00\)
3. For taking the trash to the curb: \(2 \times \$0.75 = \$1.50\)
4. For cleaning his room: \(1 \times \$1.50 = \$1.50\)

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
\$3.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.50 + \$1.50 = \$9.00
\]

So, the total amount of money Jason earned in the two-week period is \(\$9.00\)."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of blood in one shark.
2. Multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten.

First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by ten:
\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (morning) had entered. Since 50 people came in the morning, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. According to the problem, the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. **Initial amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. **After the children drank**: They drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **After the wife spilled**: She spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. **After Ronnie took some**: He took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which they shared equally. Therefore, each person gets:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of fish that have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Therefore, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, which had 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and Amy uses up half of them.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - After using up 3 colors from one set, the remaining colors from that set are:
     \[
     6 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - The total number of colors from the remaining two sets and the reduced set is:
     \[
     3 \text{ colors from the reduced set} + 6 \text{ colors from the other two sets} = 9 \text{ colors}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches high, the remaining height is the space from the first floor's ceiling to the roof, which is the height of the second floor.

Height of the second floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor's ceiling = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.

240 inches"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs based on the average:
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in a day is \( 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
4 miles."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Last tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"First, calculate the total number of balloons filled:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon to find out how many were thrown:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of medicine in one dose.

1. The amount of the first medicine in one dose is 14 mL.
2. The amount of the second medicine in one dose is 3 times the first, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.
3. Therefore, the total amount of medicine in one dose is \(14 + 42 = 56\) mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL}\]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has the capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's class is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = \text{Capacity of Ali's school} + \text{Capacity of John's school} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is also:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.

   \]

**Final Answer:**
Tim was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people on the bus (270) exceeds the bus's capacity. Therefore, the bus is already over capacity, and no more people can enter.

**Final numerical answer**:
The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(0\)."
"First, let's calculate the initial cost of one visit and the total cost for the first 5 years.

The initial cost of one visit is $2. Pauline visits the museum three times a year, so the cost per year is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

For 5 years, the total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the new cost is:
\[ 2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Pauline continued to visit the museum three times a year for the next 3 years at the new cost of $5 per visit. So, the cost per year for the next 3 years is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

For 3 years, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the first 5 years and the next 3 years, the total amount Pauline spent is:
\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( 32 \) feet."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails on each hand (assuming she has 10 nails per hand). Therefore, the total number of nails is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars."

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he drives continuously without stops for simplicity, though the problem states he takes stops), the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, the total number of grapes is unknown, but we can represent it as \( G \). After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes are:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = G - 36 \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the remaining grapes were all used for the pies, we can set up the equation:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

To find the initial number of grapes \( G \), we solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

So, the initial number of grapes was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down the costs and then calculate the annual expenditure.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost of pasta} + \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of gruyere cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can determine the average time spent cleaning per day:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Finally, to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total working time per day}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at $1/3 per egg is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies.

- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
  \[
  20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40
  \]

- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
  \[
  40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40
  \]

So, the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
\[
\$40 + \$40 = \$80
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays she buys.

- Frances buys five trays at $4 each:
  \[
  5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20
  \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[
\$80 - \$20 = \$60
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Frances has left is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Therefore, the number of children increases by 5 (one for each of the original 5 children).
   - Total number of children now: \(5 + 5 = 10\).

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - Therefore, the number of children increases by \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
   - Total number of children now: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

4. **Children Leaving:**
   - The original 5 children then give up and leave the group.
   - Total number of children now: \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final number of children following the truck is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's perform the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Next, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals:
1,360 - 142

Performing the subtraction:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin he found and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: James found 1 quarter. Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, the value of the quarters is:
   \[
   1 \times 25 = 25 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: James found 2 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, the value of the nickels is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: James found 7 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 10 cents, the value of the dimes is:
   \[
   7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of the quarters, nickels, and dimes to find the total amount of money James has:

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on meditation over 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, over 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days. Therefore, the total time spent on meditation is \(30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 840 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, let's calculate the time spent on yoga. She practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the total time spent on yoga per week is \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week}\). Over 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is \(300 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga to get the overall time spent on both practices over 4 weeks:
\[840 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 2040 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then sum these values.

\]

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is \( \boxed{101} \) square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and one dozen equals 12, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is \( 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the sale price of the shoes is \( 40 - 16 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he bought 4 ice cream cones in total. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \text{ cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13 \text{ dollars}}{6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate can fill in a day. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, so the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \, \text{holes/day} - 6 \, \text{holes/night} = 3 \, \text{holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes. Since he fills 3 holes per day, the number of days required is:

\[ \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week:

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
- Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

From this, we can calculate Aaron's speed:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total required.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line required.
The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. With 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line. So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's break down the costs and revenue for a single night:

- Tom's restaurant orders 2 meals each night, and each meal costs $5. Therefore, the cost of the meals per night is \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per night.
- Thus, the total cost per night is \( \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \).

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the revenue per night is \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\).

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the weekly revenue is \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\).

Therefore, the total amount they make in a week is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Final numerical answer:
\[
8

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
