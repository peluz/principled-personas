"First, let's figure out how many eggs Janet has left after she uses some for herself and baking.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the total number of eggs used is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

Now, subtract the eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, the total money she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) × $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. 

Half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the original purchase price of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the increase in value is $120,000. Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which includes the purchase price and the repair costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70,000} \]"
"James runs 60 meters in each sprint. He does 3 sprints each time he exercises. He exercises 3 times a week.

First, let's find out how many meters he runs in one session:
60 meters/sprint × 3 sprints/session = 180 meters/session

Now, let's find out how many meters he runs in a week:
180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi's chickens need in a day. Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed, and she has 20 chickens. So, the total daily feed requirement is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, which is 60% of the first glass's price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs. Each pair will cost $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

64"
"First, let's find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Charleston's sheep = 4 × Seattle's sheep
Charleston's sheep = 4 × 20
Charleston's sheep = 80

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:

Toulouse's sheep = 2 × Charleston's sheep
Toulouse's sheep = 2 × 80
Toulouse's sheep = 160

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Total sheep = Toulouse's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

So, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"First, let's calculate how long it would normally take to download the file without any interruptions.

The file size is 200 GB, and Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute. So, the normal download time would be:

\[ \text{Normal download time} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

However, 40% of the way through the download, there is an interruption. Let's find out how much of the file that is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of 200 GB} = 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

So, 80 GB is 40% of the file. Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute:

\[ \text{Time to download 80 GB} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she has to download the entire 200 GB again.

The total time for the download, including the restart and the re-download, is:

\[ \text{Time to download 80 GB} + \text{Restart time} + \text{Time to download 200 GB} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:

\[ \boxed{160 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around.

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he travels is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to calculate the distance John covers on his way back home. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph. The distance he covers in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time of 4 hours minus the 2 hours in traffic and the 0.5 hours already spent driving, which is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
At a speed of 80 mph, the distance he covers in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance John covers on his way back home is:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours. Since her regular rate is $10 per hour, her earnings for the first 40 hours are:

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 overtime hours). Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so:

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:

\[ \$460 \]"
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month. So, we calculate:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]
So, in the second month, there were 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%. First, we find 30% of 180:
\[ 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \]
Then, we subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month:
\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \]
So, in the third month, there were 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the pastries:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Costs**: Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.
3. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after the initial cost:

- **Year 1**: Revenue = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
- **Year 2**: Revenue = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
- **Year 3**: Revenue = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
- And so on...

To find out when the total profit becomes positive, we need to account for the initial cost of $90. We can set up the equation for the total profit after \(n\) years:

\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7.5n - 90 \]

We need to find the smallest \(n\) such that the total profit is positive:

\[ 7.5n - 90 > 0 \]
\[ 7.5n > 90 \]
\[ n > \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n > 12 \]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, \(n = 13\).

So, it will take **13 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's work through the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.

2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house, and she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

5. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after all these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

7. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

8. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]

9. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.

The rest of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. We can find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

So, 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, as it yields a higher profit of $125.

**Final Answer:**
$125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction.

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel 80 miles westward.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel 150 miles northward.

Now, we add the distances for each day:

- **Total distance for the first day:** 80 miles
- **Total distance for the second day:** 150 miles

Adding these together gives the total distance for each train over the two days:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"First, let's calculate Jill's earnings from teaching:

- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:

- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from being a coach are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from being a coach are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, to find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that the total distance is 12 miles and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can rearrange the formula to solve for total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles) walking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Calculate the year Raymond's son was born:**
   - Since Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son, and we need to find out how many years ago this was, we need to know Raymond's current age.
   - We know Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, so Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.
   - Therefore, Raymond was 23 years old \(25 - 23 = 2\) years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to his first 3 customers, and each bought 1 DVD. So, that's 3 DVDs.

Then, he sold DVDs to his next 2 customers, and each bought 2 DVDs. So, that's 2 customers times 2 DVDs, which equals 4 DVDs.

His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we add the DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers:

3 DVDs + 4 DVDs = 7 DVDs

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle is burning and then use the rate at which it melts.

1. Calculate the total time the candle is burning:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

2. Use the rate of melting to find the total length of the candle that melts:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, the candle will melt \(2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}\).

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. Milk: 5 packs * $3 each = $15
3. Apples: 4 apples * $1.50 each = $6

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount she paid.

Amount spent on pizza = $50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza.

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then add them together.

1. **Shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50.

2. **Pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Now, we add the total costs for each type of item to find the total amount spent:

- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126

Let's add these amounts:

- $49.50 + $67.50 = $117
- $117 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

**Final Answer:**
$243"
"First, let's figure out how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, in 60 days, she will eat:

\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings, so we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Each carton costs $4.00, so for 4 cartons, the total cost will be:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:

\[ \$16.00 \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Identify the distance at which Henry made his first stop: 20 miles.
3. Identify the distance at which Henry made his second stop: 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, his second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.
4. Calculate the distance between the first and second stops: \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

So, Henry traveled \(\boxed{25}\) miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the cost of the boots be \( B \) dollars.
2. The cost of one pair of high heels is $33.
3. The cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, so it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
4. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   99 = B - 5
   \]
6. To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 99 + 5 = 104
   \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts. Together, these parts make up their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses:
80 (first friend) + 60 (second friend) + 100 (third friend) = 240

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
240 ÷ 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80."
"First, let's calculate the daily care time for all the dogs:

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on the dogs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, Gretchen has 110 coins in total, so:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

It is also given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has 5 more than 20 jewels:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

So, Terry spends \(\$75.00\) on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate how much money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so:

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the total amount of money he had before buying the video games was:

\[ \$160 + \$5 = \$165 \]

Since John initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he now has $165 after buying the video games, it means he has used up all the money from the lego sets and has $5 left. Therefore, he has no lego sets left to count.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's find out how much time John runs each day:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
- Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

John runs a total of 60 miles a week. Now, we can calculate his speed:
- Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. So, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"First, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

When Polly is not holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw it for:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Final answer:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many pieces of apple pie were available at the beginning. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find out how many calories are in the whole 300g bag of chips. Since it has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more calories you can consume to reach your daily target of 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories. Since the 300g bag has 1250 calories, the number of grams per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, we multiply the number of calories you can still consume by the grams per calorie:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's figure out how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

\[ \text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost will be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Net profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's find the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she bought, we need to figure out how many she used in total and then subtract the ones she had left.

First, let's calculate the total number of post-it notes she used:
\[ 220 \text{ (used at work)} + 23 \text{ (left over)} = 243 \text{ (total used)} \]

Next, we subtract the number of post-it notes she started with from the total number used to find out how many were in the package:
\[ 243 \text{ (total used)} - 80 \text{ (initially had)} = 163 \]

So, the package contained 163 post-it notes.

163"
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is 4 feet long, which is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

So, Lloyd makes \$294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to find out how long it takes him to travel back at 6 mph.

First, let's find the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. He travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance back is also 30 miles, and he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to travel back = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how many toys, each weighing 1/2 pound, are needed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds. We do this by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's revenue ($480), we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:

$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"First, let's find out how many kittens Patchy has. Since Patchy has thrice the number of adopted kittens, and there are 7 adopted kittens, we can calculate the number of Patchy's kittens as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens. Now, we can add the number of kittens from both Patchy and Trixie to the number of adopted kittens to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has:

\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = \text{Number of adopted kittens} + \text{Number of Patchy's kittens} + \text{Number of Trixie's kittens} \]
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 40 \]

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are:
30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.

Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how much money he spends each time and then see how many times he can afford it with his total money.

1. The cost of a movie ticket and popcorn is $7 + $7 = $14.
2. Peter has $42 for the week.

Now, we divide the total amount of money Peter has by the cost of one movie and popcorn session:

\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit.
3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83."
"First, let's calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00.

25% of $40.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the 25% fee is $10.00.

Now, we add this fee to the original bill:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Next, we add the $3.00 in delivery fees:
\[ 50 + 3 = 53 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ 53 + 4 = 57 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to add the raspberries in the clusters to the individual raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
- There are 6 clusters.
- Each cluster has 20 raspberries.

So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the 120 raspberries from the clusters:
\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

1. Calculate the number of unripe oranges:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5
   \]

2. Now, add up all the oranges that are not good:
   \[
   \text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
   \]

3. Subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
   \[
   25 - 8 = 17
   \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we need to find the total cost of the materials and construction. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. So, the total cost for materials and construction is:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of this total amount to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of materials and construction to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years.
2. Calculate the additional pension she gets after 20 years based on the 5% rule.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total annual pension after 30 years.

### Step 1: Annual Pension for the First 20 Years
For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

### Step 2: Additional Pension After 20 Years
Starting after 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is still $50,000 (since the fixed amount doesn't change).

The additional pension is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = \$2,500 \]

### Step 3: Total Annual Pension After 30 Years
The total annual pension after 30 years is the sum of the fixed pension and the additional pension:
\[ \$50,000 + \$2,500 = \$52,500 \]

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than $140.
   - Calculate 10% of $140: \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - New monthly charge: \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to first determine how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

So, we calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:
\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time he spends on TV and reading in one week is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\[9 \times 4 = 36\]

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Players: 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Coaches: 2 coaches

Total for one school: 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
Total people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:
48"
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

Number of emeralds = 2 × Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 × 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

So, there were 595 gems in the chest."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, let's find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are. We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. So, we can calculate the number of teachers as follows:

Number of teachers = Total number of students ÷ Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 36

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to figure out how much money she earned from her allowance and then subtract that from her total amount of money at the end.

1. Calculate the total allowance Bailey received:
   - Weekly allowance: $5
   - Number of weeks: 8
   - Total allowance = $5 * 8 = $40

2. Bailey's total money at the end is $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her total money:
   - Total money at the end: $100
   - Total allowance: $40
   - Money she started with = $100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, she teaches \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, in total, she teaches \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes in a week.

Next, we calculate the number of students in these classes. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students:
\[33 \times 15 = 495\]

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total money she makes in a week is:
\[495 \times 15 = 7425\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. Calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe.
3. Add the number of instructions from both recipes.

The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, we calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe as follows:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we add the number of instructions from both recipes:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Kelian has to read \(\boxed{60}\) instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the money raised from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times \$3 \text{ per brownie} = \$129 \]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the money raised from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4 \text{ per slice} = \$92 \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \$221 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest.

Each cell phone costs $150, and Shiela bought five of them.

\[ \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the sum of the total cost without interest and the total interest:

\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay each month:

\[ \boxed{255} \]"

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36.
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18.
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34.

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

So, Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **4th level (top level):** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **2nd level:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **1st level (bottom level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ 7.5 \]"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:

\[ 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food this is. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:

\[ \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \]

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2 \, \text{bags} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much laundry David does:**

"First, let's figure out the cost per flower for each package.

For the packages of 3 flowers for $2.50:
- Cost per flower = $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.8333 (rounded to four decimal places)

For the packages of 2 flowers for $1:
- Cost per flower = $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, the better price is the package of 2 flowers for $1.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers using the better price.

- Number of packages of 2 flowers needed for 18 flowers = 18 ÷ 2 = 9 packages
- Total cost for 18 flowers = 9 × $1 = $9

If Vincent were to buy 18 flowers at the other price (3 flowers for $2.50), he would need:
- Number of packages of 3 flowers needed for 18 flowers = 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packages
- Total cost for 18 flowers = 6 × $2.50 = $15

The money saved by buying at the better price is:
- Money saved = $15 - $9 = $6

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"First, we need to calculate the discount amount. The original cost is $100, and the discount is 30%.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we add the amount of water the boy got, which is 6 liters:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 10 \text{ liters} \]"

1. Charlie started with 10 stickers.
2. He bought 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He received 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, 4 times Grace's weight is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds.

Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, Alex's weight is \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds.

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's use some simple math to solve this problem.

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \).
2. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).
3. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is \( L + (L + 8) = 22 \).

Now, let's solve for \( L \):

\[ L + L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:

\[ \text{Games won} = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

The football team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang throughout the day. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Time the Alarm Rang:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.
   - So, the number of rings for the first time is \(4\).

2. **Second Time the Alarm Rang:**
   - The second time, the alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Time the Alarm Rang:**
   - The third time, the alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
- First time: \(4\) rings
- Second time: \(12\) rings
- Third time: \(6\) rings

Total number of rings = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

So, the alarm rang a total of \(22\) times."
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Annual Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years.

3. **First Year After 5 Years**: After 5 years, Sylvie's salary increases by 10%.
   - New Salary = Initial Salary + 10% of Initial Salary
   - New Salary = $600 + 0.10 * $600
   - New Salary = $600 + $60
   - New Salary = $660 per month

4. **Second Year After 5 Years**: The salary increases by another 10%.
   - New Salary = $660 + 0.10 * $660
   - New Salary = $660 + $66
   - New Salary = $726 per month

5. **Third Year After 5 Years**: The salary increases by another 10%.
   - New Salary = $726 + 0.10 * $726
   - New Salary = $726 + $72.60
   - New Salary = $798.60 per month

6. **Annual Salary**: To find the annual salary, we multiply the monthly salary by 12.
   - Annual Salary = $798.60 * 12
   - Annual Salary = $9,583.20

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9,583.20."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"First, we need to determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends. To find out how many will show up, we calculate 3/4 of 16:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

So, 12 guests are expected to show up.

Next, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina needs. She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. Therefore, for 12 guests, she needs:

\[ 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \]

Christina needs 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag:

"First, let's calculate how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, we multiply 10 lbs by 20:

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child will eat half as much as an adult, each child will eat:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad they will eat is:

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children:

1. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.

First, we find Corey's age:
- Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.

Next, we find Amy's age:
- Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.

Finally, we find Jackson's age:
- Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to find out how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee now runs it in 38 seconds and used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. If his speed improved by 10%, his time would decrease by 10%. We can calculate the new time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"First, let's find out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Next, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Volume Loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Volume of the Sauce**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.

3. **Volume of Tomatoes Before Cooking**: Since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking would be twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.

4. **Number of Cans Used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can. So, \(64 \div 16 = 4\) cans.

5. **Number of Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is \(4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}\).

**Final Answer**: Freda used 12 tomatoes."

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to account for all the cars that didn't drive through and the total number of cars originally on the motorway.

First, let's determine the total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam:
- 5 cars took an exit.
- Therefore, the number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Now, we know that the total number of cars originally on the motorway is 30. If 5 cars didn't drive through, then the number of cars that did drive through is:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Out of these 25 cars, 20 cars drove through in the second 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we need to find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving away 40 plants. She originally had 80 plants and will give away 40 plants, so the number of plants she will have left is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will also receive 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the 40 plants she has left, the total number of potted plants she will have is:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these numbers.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day for the next 4 days.

6 pages per day"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which is 3 glasses/day * 5 days = 15 glasses of water.

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and has a soda with dinner instead of water. That's 2 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which is 2 glasses/day * 2 days = 4 glasses of water.

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 15 glasses (weekdays) + 4 glasses (weekends) = 19 glasses of water.

19 glasses of water"
"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can use the information given about how long it takes to cover a certain distance.

First, we know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

We can set up a proportion to solve this:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}} \]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve for \( x \):

\[ 10 \times 42 = 3 \times x \]

\[ 420 = 3x \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{420}{3} \]

\[ x = 140 \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

140"
"First, let's find out how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places the pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 500 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats as follows:

Cody's cookies = 3 × Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 × 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, to find out how many cookies both Cody and Amir eat together, we add the number of cookies each of them eats:

Total cookies = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies = 15 + 5
Total cookies = 20

So, both Cody and Amir eat 20 cookies together."
"First, let's calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, let's calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the TV watching time for each day:

- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Friday**: 2 hours
- **Total known time**: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the known time from the total time:

7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (known time) = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the time spent on Wednesday by the length of each episode:

1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final answer**: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry baked \( x \) cookies last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. But he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.

The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cashback. The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon. For 10 gallons, the total cashback would be:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find the final amount the person will pay:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, after the cashback rewards, the gas will cost:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate.
2. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate.
3. Add the totals from both to find the combined total.
4. Divide the combined total by 2 to find the average.

Let's start with Beatrice:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- To find the total, we multiply the width by the length: \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Now, Marcell:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- To find the total, we multiply the width by the length: \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total: \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, to find the average, we divide the combined total by 2:
- Average: \(90 \div 2 = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's figure out how many feet Julia needs to row to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds and she can row 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate the total distance by dividing 64 seconds by 16 seconds and then multiplying by 20 feet.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64}{16}\right) \times 20 = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, we can calculate the water intake as follows:

\[ \text{Water intake} = \left(\frac{80}{10}\right) \times 2 = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

16 liters"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. There are 4 teachers.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply by the number of cleanings per lesson.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lessons in a day.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- There are 4 teachers.
- Total number of lessons = 2 lessons/teacher/day * 4 teachers = 8 lessons/day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cleanings in a day.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.
- Total number of cleanings = 8 lessons/day * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings/day.

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. Over 15 days, he plants:

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

If 5 of these flowers did not grow, then the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{\text{Jamal's phone capacity}}{6} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = 50 \times D \]

Since we already know Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 300 = 50 \times D \]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 50:

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 of these boards.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 of these boards.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \$100.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \$80.
   - Total original cost: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the new prices after the 50% increase.

4. **New price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Original price: \$10.
   - Increase: 50% of \$10 = \( 0.50 \times \$10 = \$5 \).
   - New price: \( \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \).

5. **New price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Original price: \$16.
   - Increase: 50% of \$16 = \( 0.50 \times \$16 = \$8 \).
   - New price: \( \$16 + \$8 = \$24 \).

Now, let's calculate the total selling price.

6. **Total selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - New price: \$15.
   - Sasha has 10 of these boards.
   - Total selling price: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

7. **Total selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - New price: \$24.
   - Sasha has 5 of these boards.
   - Total selling price: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

8. **Total selling price:**
   - Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \$150.
   - Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \$120.
   - Total selling price: \( \$150 + \$120 = \$270 \).

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water Katy used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. This total is made up of the 20 parts in the ratio. To find out how much one part is, we divide the total by the number of parts:

\[ \text{One part} = \frac{120 \text{ teaspoons}}{20 \text{ parts}} = 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} \]

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the total, we can find the amount of sugar used by multiplying the number of parts for sugar by the value of one part:

\[ \text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \text{ parts} \times 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} = 42 \text{ teaspoons} \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So, he buys a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pairs of shoes.

So, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out Adrien's salary four years ago, which is given as $40,000.

Adrien's current salary is 40% more than what he was earning four years ago. So, we calculate 40% of $40,000:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 40,000 = 0.40 \times 40,000 = 16,000 \]

So, Adrien's current salary is:

\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

Next, we need to find out Lylah's salary four years ago. Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \). Therefore, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as:

\[ 1.30 \times L = 40,000 \]

To find \( L \), we solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

Now, Lylah's current salary is 30% more than her salary four years ago. So, we calculate 30% of $30,769.23:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30,769.23 = 0.30 \times 30,769.23 = 9,230.77 \]

So, Lylah's current salary is:

\[ 30,769.23 + 9,230.77 = 40,000 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

\[ 56,000 + 40,000 = 96,000 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

\[ \boxed{96000} \]"

- Oranges: 8
Total for Morisette: \(5 + 8 = 13\)

Kael's fruits:
- Apples: 10
- Oranges: 4
Total for Kael: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Adding the totals together:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours

"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, the distance she covers in the first 3 hours is:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. The total time is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

In the remaining 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour, so the distance she covers in the next 4 hours is:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of her run, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."
"First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. These 20 letters are now part of the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the already-stamped pile before Jennie added the 20 letters is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began was \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons left was:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 \]

We know that after using the spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together:

38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages.

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"First, we need to find out how many friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy made by adding 20 to the number of friends Lily made.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each of them made.

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together."
"First, let's find out the cost of a watermelon and an orange based on the cost of a pepper.

Given:
- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.

Calculate the cost of a watermelon:
\[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Calculate the cost of an orange:
\[ \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons at $45 each.
- 20 peppers at $15 each.
- 10 oranges at $40 each.

Calculate the total cost for the watermelons:
\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \]

Calculate the total cost for the peppers:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Calculate the total cost for the oranges:
\[ 10 \times 40 = 400 \]

Add up all the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880."
"First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors with the patients each day. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we can calculate the total time as follows:

\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time from minutes to hours because the charges are given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour, so:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40000 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost to the hospital. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40000 - \$30000 = \$10000 \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of:

\[ \$10000 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

This means 20 elves quit. Now, we subtract these 20 elves from the original 60 to find out how many are left:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract these 10 elves from the 40 that are left:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Joseph's expenditure in June.
2. Add the expenditures of May and June together.

First, we know that Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. So, we calculate his June expenditure as follows:

\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Now, we add the expenditures of May and June to find the total expenditure for the two months:

\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

For the roller coaster:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

For the luge:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

So, Pam used:
\[ 12 \text{ tickets (roller coaster)} + 12 \text{ tickets (luge)} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times.

For the roller coaster:
\[ 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

For the luge:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

So, Fred used:
\[ 24 \text{ tickets (roller coaster)} + 12 \text{ tickets (luge)} = 36 \text{ tickets} \]

Now, we add the tickets used by Pam and Fred to find the total number of tickets used that day:
\[ 24 \text{ tickets (Pam)} + 36 \text{ tickets (Fred)} = 60 \text{ tickets} \]

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:
\[ 60 \]"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

So, the miles walked on Wednesday is \(41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"First, let's figure out how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Brian has 15 video games right before the comparison.

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has and then subtract 5:

\[ 3 \times 15 - 5 \]

First, multiply 3 by 15:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, subtract 5 from 45:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, bags of chips, and cookies before any fees or tips.

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the delivery fee and tip.

\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee on the total cost.

\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost before the tip.

\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total.

\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

So, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Mark completed in each test and then find out how many he left incomplete.

### First Test:
- **Total questions**: 75
- **Rate**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time allowed**: 8 hours

First, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions and Mark completed 40 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

### Second Test:
- **Total questions**: 100
- **Rate**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time allowed**: 6 hours

Next, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions and Mark completed 30 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

### Total Incomplete Questions:
To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say the number of blue gumballs is \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs is \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Now, substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]

Calculate the multiplication first:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]

Then, add the numbers:
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

1. Total cars available for rent: 20
2. Automatic cars: 12
3. Manual cars: 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the information given:
- \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queens)
- \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can write:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"First, let's figure out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we can calculate the total hours in a week as follows:

2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, since Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings if he spent his video game time working instead:

$10/hour × 14 hours/week = $140/week

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

$140"
"First, let's identify which items are nonfood items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are nonfood items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of nonfood items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the 10% tax on these nonfood items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of nonfood items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and nonfood items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of supplies for each client. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. Therefore, the cost for each client is:

\[ 2 \times 2 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total cost for all clients is:

\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ 92 - 72 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Kim will make each week is:

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
John has 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, we divide 12 by 3:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]
So, John can harvest 4 times in a year.

Step 3: Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. Let's calculate the total number of Lego pieces:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - 1/2 of 30 bees return.
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave.
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the next 6 hours return.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return: \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees.
   - Bees that left in the next 6 hours: 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 15 + 60 = 75 \) bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **75**."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to first calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

1. The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.
2. The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
3. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is $10 + $12 = $22.

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received.

So, the amount given to the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"First, let's find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can substitute and solve for Dorothy's friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Next, we need to find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles
- Convert to feet: \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute
- Time to get home: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles
- Convert to feet: \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute
- Time to get home: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Since Steve finishes in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in time between the winner and the loser is:
- \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by for bicycles, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by for tricycles, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by for a unicycle, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

So, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[5 \text{ dollars}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs, and each pack has six cookies inside. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost of these 60 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half of what Dave ate.**
   - Seagull ate: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.**
   - Pigeons ate: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.**
5. **Ants carried off the last fry, leaving 5 behind.**

Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack as \( x \).

- After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
- After the seagull ate 7 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
- After the pigeons ate 9 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

Now, the raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so one-third of the remaining fries were left:
\[ \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \]

After the raccoon, the ants carried off the last fry, leaving 5 behind:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes. He has these classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which is 3 days a week.

Each of these days, he spends 3 hours in classes. So, for these 3 days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours he spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes. He has these classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is 2 days a week.

Each of these days, he spends 4 hours in classes (2 hours each class, and he has 2 classes). So, for these 2 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to find the total number of hours he spends in classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, in one semester, Kimo spends attending classes:
\[ 272 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Next, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

**Final Answer:**
280"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes each month.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).

So, Blake's total distance is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each back and forth is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

So, Kelly's total distance is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

Final answer:
\[ 280 \text{ yards} \]"

   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = 1 rim * $20/rim = $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday would be:

\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."

Next, let's calculate the number of fish Locsin caught:

- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin to find the total number of fish they caught together:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: $20

"First, let's find the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that one red car costs $4. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the amount of money Jackie will lose by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant. She will lose $35 for each hour of freelance work she doesn't do. If she loses 3 hours of work, the total loss in income is:

\[ 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 105 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to compare this loss to the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the amount she would lose by doing her taxes herself:

\[ 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's sum these amounts:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Adding step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

So, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. So, for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's use some simple math to solve this problem.

1. Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years:
- Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

According to the problem, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 28 - 4 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Seth is 16 years old."
"First, let's figure out how much money Jimmy has based on the information given.

Ethel has $8. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. So, we need to calculate twice the amount Ethel has and then add $2.

Twice the amount Ethel has is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, add $2 to this amount to find out how much Jimmy has:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend, we get:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's find the cost of the jacket. Since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, and the hat costs $25, the jacket costs:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pants. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated by adding the cost of the hat and the cost of the jacket, and then dividing by 2:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total cost of each uniform by adding the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then add them together.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we add the total legs from each type of creature:

\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \( 1210 \)."
"First, let's find out the ages of the birds step by step.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

The total age of the four birds is:
\[19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\]

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the minimum payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

\[ \text{Final answer: } 95 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many glasses of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

The cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( G \). The total cost for lemons and sugar is \( 5G \).

Each gallon makes 20 glasses, so they made \( 20G \) glasses in total.

They sell each glass for $0.50, so the total revenue from selling \( 20G \) glasses is \( 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \).

Their profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $25. So, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ 10G - 5G = 25 \]
\[ 5G = 25 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons, the total cost for lemons is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"First, let's find out how many Chinese participants there are in the race. We know there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

4. **Donation to charity**:
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.

5. **Remaining after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.

6. **Total given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife.

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Bo has 40 crabs and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:

Bo's crabs: 40
Monic's crabs: 40 - 4 = 36

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36 crabs, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:

Rani's crabs: 36 + 10 = 46

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours. So, he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours. So, he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the amounts from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned \(\$130\) for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the votes. Since the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20

"To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first figure out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{\text{Number of pink calla lilies}}{5} \]

Substituting the number of pink calla lilies:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{Number of white carnations} \]

Substituting the number of white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm."
"First, let's figure out Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded):
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded):
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for Team 2 is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time:
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team (Team 1) will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer: 25%**"
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

So, they both picked 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - Total straw used = straw for hamsters + straw for rabbits + straw for rats.
   - Total straw used = 50 pieces + 20 pieces + straw for rats = 160 pieces.
   - Therefore, straw for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Rats:**
   - The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Let the number of rats in each cage be \( x \).
   - Total number of rats = 3 cages * \( x \) rats/cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 * \( x \) * 6 pieces = 90 pieces.
   - So, \( 18x = 90 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months, including the monthly interest.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2%

Let's calculate the amount after each month.

**After 1st Month:**
- Interest for 1st month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1st month = $100 + $2 = $102

**After 2nd Month:**
- Interest for 2nd month = $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2nd month = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**After 3rd Month:**
- Interest for 3rd month = $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3rd month = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

**Final Answer:**
$106.12"
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Calculate the cost per bag including transportation:**
   - Cost of wheat per bag: $20
   - Transportation cost per bag: $2
   - Total cost per bag: $20 + $2 = $22

2. **Let the number of bags be \( x \).**
   - Total cost for \( x \) bags: \( 22x \)

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the bags:**
   - Selling price per bag: $30
   - Total revenue for \( x \) bags: \( 30x \)

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Given profit: $400
   - So, \( 30x - 22x = 400 \)
   - Simplify the equation: \( 8x = 400 \)

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \)

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the food to find the total cost for these items:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Adding the cost of the rides to the cost of the tickets and food gives us the total amount spent:
\[ 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 102.00 \div 3 = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many minutes John spends collecting peaches. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and John collects peaches for 3 hours, we can find the total minutes by multiplying:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find out how many peaches he collects in total, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ducks.
2. Then, divide that number by 7 to find out how many pounds they need per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For 10 ducks, the total is:
\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily amount of insects needed.
There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - Now, the total number of pink flamingos is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

At noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons would be:

5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase. After buying the crayons, the change she will get is:

$20 - $10 = $10

So, the change Violetta will get is $10."
"First, let's find out how much a pen costs. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. So, the cost of a pen is:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. Since each pen costs $1.50, the cost of 8 pens is:
\[ 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

So, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each restaurant will receive:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To find out how many kids are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women

Now, let's do the math:

Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we add up all the cards she collected over the three months and her initial number of cards.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}

So, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards now."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- He edits an equal number of sentences for each of the two publishers.
- Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Now, let's calculate the payment from each publisher:

- For Publisher A: 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
- For Publisher B: Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, the rate is 10 cents per sentence. So, 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we add the payments from both publishers to find the total amount Mark makes in a week:

2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. That's a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 every week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the new salary after the 5% raise. A 5% raise on his current salary means his new salary will be:

\[ 104000 + (104000 \times 0.05) = 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money John made that year, including the one-time monetary reward of $5000. So, we add the reward to his new annual salary:

\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we can calculate the total tons of grapes as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total barrels of wine as follows:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese used for each meal and then add them all together.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = \(2 \text{ slices/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets = \(3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinners:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese = \(8 \text{ slices}\).

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the average calculation**: The average score is the sum of all test scores divided by the number of tests. Since Mr. Bert allows removing the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score from the first five tests and then include the sixth test score.

2. **Identify the lowest score from the first five tests**: The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

3. **Calculate the sum of the remaining scores**: Remove 71 from the list and add the rest: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

4. **Set up the equation for the average**: Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The average of the remaining four scores and the sixth test score should be 93. The equation is:
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5

So, Brinley needs to score **98** on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first four weeks and the distance he covered in the next three weeks, and then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the next three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to find the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, let's find out the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2.

Weight of each candied apple = 40g / 2 = 20g

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g.

Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 * 40g = 1000g

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g.

Total weight of candied apples = 80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.

Total weight of Joe's bag of candy = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - So, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - So, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
- The amount needed is \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that \(4x = 40\):
- Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{40}{4} = 10\).

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:
4"
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks the entire perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \(\boxed{8}\) gallons of water."
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

This means the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. 

To find 10% of $2000:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Janeth will pay in total over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's find out how many dahlias there are. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's find the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is 45 years."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored based on the information given.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate half of Naomi's points and then add 10.
   \[
   \text{Half of Naomi's points} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251.

5. **Jojo's Points:**
   To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent on the puzzles, we need to calculate the time she spent on crossword puzzles and the time she spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent on puzzles = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent on puzzles = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[

"First, let's find out how many petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

90 (geraniums) - 40 = 50 (petunias)

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, let's calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. Carlos rents the canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. So, the cost for Carlos is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. Benji rents the banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. So, the cost for Benji is:
\[ 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs for both Carlos and Benji to find the total amount they pay for their rentals:
\[ 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount they pay for their rentals, altogether, is:
\[ 180 \text{ dollars} \]"

   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Determine the travel time by car:**
   - The travel time by car is half as many days as the travel time by bus.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Calculate the total travel time:**
   - Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus, which takes 6 days.
   - He will return from Rochester by car, which takes 3 days.
   - The total travel time is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is **9 days**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after he loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we calculate the probability of picking a water type card:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Convert the fraction to a percentage:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the upgrade cost:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute together.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 \div 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

30% of 120 watermelons were ready:
\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were taken home by Ashlyn, leaving:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were harvested, leaving:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to find the total cost before registration.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration cost. The registration cost is $1000 per car, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert. So, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} = \text{Shells collected by Robert} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. According to the problem, Kylie collected 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. So, we can calculate the number of shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} \]
\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is 50."
"Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs would be:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Total number of insects in the garden: 75"
"First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. One-third of 36 penguins is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, we calculate how many penguins go inside the cave. Again, one-third of 36 penguins is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, we need to find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing. We start with the total number of penguins and subtract the ones that have either jumped in the ocean or gone inside the cave:

\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

12"
"First, let's figure out how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{\text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes eaten by both Steve and his girlfriend per day:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per day} = \text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day} + \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = \text{Total tomatoes per day} \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to determine how many vines are required to produce 63 tomatoes per week:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Total tomatoes per week}}{\text{Tomatoes per vine per week}} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, we multiply 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Ink Collection**: After using these pens, he can collect the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can collect the ink from 20 pens (since 5 pens are used to make 1 new pen, and 25 - 5 = 20) to make 4 new pens (since 20 pens / 5 = 4).

Now, let's add up all the pens:
- Initial pens: 25
- Pens made from the first collection: 4
- After using these 4 pens, he can collect the ink from 4 pens to make 0 new pens (since 4 < 5).

So, the total number of pens Ram has is:
25 (initial pens) + 4 (pens made from the first collection) = 29 pens.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Jessa is 20 years old and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:

\[ \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Mary is. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of the three girls. We add Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age together:

\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This means the number of students remaining in the hall is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 700 students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This means the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

Given that John has 54 candies, we can substitute and solve for Robert's candies:

\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can calculate:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. So, we can find the difference:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."

Dolly will read:
- Her own 2 books
- Pandora's 1 book

Pandora will read:
- Her own 1 book
- Dolly's 2 books

So, the total number of books read will be:
- Dolly's 2 books + Pandora's 1 book + Dolly reading Pandora's 1 book + Pandora reading Dolly's 2 books

This gives us:
2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) + 1 (Pandora reading Dolly's book) + 2 (Dolly reading Pandora's book) = 6 books

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike is still writing to. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now writing to:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, for each pen pal, Mike needs to write:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since Mike is writing to 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he needs to write in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ pages/pen pal} \times 3 \text{ pen pals} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Mike spends:

\[ \boxed{3} \text{ hours writing a week} \]"

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24 fries.
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. **Ginger gave Griffin some fries, let's call this number \(x\):**
   - Fries with Griffin after Ginger gave: \(9 + x\).
5. **Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\).

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
\[7 + x = 27\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final answer:**
Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other, so the difference is:

\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

We know that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:

\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Final numerical answer:
7"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works each week. She works 6 hours a day and needs it done 4 times a week, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she works over the 5 weeks is:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since Jean gets a 10% discount for the amount of work done, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

Therefore, Jean paid:

\[ \$27,000 \]"
"First, let's add up all the expenses Isabelle had for the party supplies:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid $32."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of onions the chef bought. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, we multiply 50 pounds by 4:

\[ 50 \text{ pounds/bag} \times 4 \text{ bags} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the chef spent. Since the cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, we multiply the total weight of onions by the cost per pound:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300 \]

So, the chef spent \(\$300\)."
"First, let's calculate how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Calories consumed by Sue:
- \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Calories consumed by Sue's sister:
- \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 60 = 0.5 × 60 = 30 boys.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 60 = 0.5 × 60 = 30 girls.

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.
   - Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Total girls in the school = 30 girls.
   - Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes = 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - Third class has 3 girls.
   - Number of boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Number of girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:
\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

Then, he downloaded 18 more apps, so the total number of apps became:
\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

So, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is \(3 \times 12 = 36\).

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)
- Cougars: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

So, the total number of animals Rick killed is \(46 + 27 = 73\).

**Final Answer: 73**"
"First, we need to find out what floor Bill is going to based on the given information. Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The problem states that he rides the elevator up to a floor that is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

So, we calculate the target floor as follows:
\[ 4 \times \text{starting floor} + 6 \]

Substituting the starting floor (3) into the equation:
\[ 4 \times 3 + 6 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

**18**"
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

Final answer:
\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cows Mr. Sylas adds to each stall. He buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls.

\[ \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each of the 20 stalls originally had 20 cows. After Mr. Sylas adds 2 more cows to each stall, each stall will have:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"
"First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin and bill Brady has.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1. Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   \[
   40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up all the values:

So, Brady has \(\boxed{45}\) dollars in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood tree:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before termites ate any part of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. So, the weight of the wood that was eaten is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final weight of the redwood is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books. So, we first calculate the total amount for the books:

\[ 0.50 \times 8 = 4.00 \]

Additionally, she has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, we add this fee to the amount for the books:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"First, let's figure out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

So,

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to find Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to the number of apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to determine how many cups are required for the total number of cookies she plans to make.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the number of cups of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies
   - For 66 cookies, we need to find out how many times 12 goes into 66:
     \[
     \frac{66}{12} = 5.5
     \]
   - Since 5.5 times the amount of flour is needed, we multiply 5.5 by 2 cups:
     \[
     5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups of flour}
     \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup:**
   - The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300.
   - Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
     \]
   - So, there are 6,200 pennies in two thirds of the cup.

2. **Convert the number of pennies to dollars:**
   - Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we can convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:
     \[
     \frac{6200}{100} = 62
     \]
   - Therefore, 6,200 pennies are equal to 62 dollars.

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is **62 dollars**."
"First, we calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has from the 5 boxes. Each box contains 50 marbles, so we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 50 \text{ marbles/box} = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to the total number of marbles she already had:

\[ 250 \text{ marbles} + 20 \text{ marbles} = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Samantha has. Since Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, and Carmen has $100, we can calculate Samantha's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Samantha's amount} = \text{Carmen's amount} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Next, let's determine how much Daisy has. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so we calculate Daisy's amount as:

\[ \text{Daisy's amount} = \text{Samantha's amount} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined. We do this by adding their individual amounts together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Carmen's amount} + \text{Samantha's amount} + \text{Daisy's amount} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts gives:

\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is:

\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[ \boxed{9500} \]"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 50 \text{ ads} \times \$5 \text{ per ad} = \$250 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 15 \text{ ads} \times \$75 \text{ per ad} = \$1125 \]

Now, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$250 + \$1125 = \$1375 \]

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of \$1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so:

"To find out how many M&Ms Mary got in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, let's add up all the M&Ms from the three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of bedroom windows is:

\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows in both houses is:

\[ 6 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

\[ 4 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:

\[ 12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the houses is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's add up the cost of the items the mother bought:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Now, we add these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find out how much change she should receive, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change."
"First, let's find out how many stitches the collar takes. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stitches the rosette takes. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. To find out how many stitches the sleeves take, we subtract the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches:

\[ \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes:

\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
- Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
- Total cost = \(800 + 2400 = 3200\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars."
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then add them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the rest of the cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, he will spend:

\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, he will spend:

\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that the sum of their current ages is 20.
2. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
3. Therefore, the total additional years added to their current sum of ages will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years.
4. Adding this to their current sum of ages: \(20 + 20 = 40\).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's use some simple math to solve this problem.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
2. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, expand the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to get all the \( S \) terms on one side:
\[ 6S - 3S + 9 = 27 \]
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- So, the total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park.

Total spots for cobras = 70 spots/cobra * 40 cobras = 2800 spots
Total spots for mambas = 35 spots/mamba * 60 mambas = 2100 spots

Now, we add the total spots for cobras and mambas to get the combined total.

Combined total spots = 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Finally, we find half the number of spots they all have combined.

Half the combined total spots = 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people from the team and coaching staff.

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is 12 team members * 2 guests = 24 guests.

Adding the team members, coaches, and guests together, we get 15 + 24 = 39 people in total.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Determine the length of each sterling silver bead:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch long.

4. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{\text{Remaining length}}{\text{Length of each bead}} = \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

**Final Answer:**
68"
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote:
- First week total: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) stories.
- Second week total: \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\) stories.

Adding the totals from both weeks:
- Total stories: \(120 + 240 = 360\).

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"First, let's find out how old Ann's brother is now. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 90 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

For the three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

For the two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, add these together to find the total number of stars in these five rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, subtract the number of stars in the other rows from the total number of stars:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, divide the remaining number of stars by 5:
\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ trucks} \]"
"First, let's find the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, let's calculate that:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars/packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 remaining chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, convert the working time into minutes:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10 and then multiply by $5:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15
15 * $5 = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round. The condition is that they must have over 20 points to get an extra point.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we add up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points for all three players is \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Final numerical answer:
83"
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
3"
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the activities for both days:

First day total:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Second day total:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Adding these together:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Now, let's find the total count of activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 370."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household in one day.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Since we need to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold from Tuesday to Friday.

- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) + 20 (Weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350
3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of the initial bid and all of Carmen's subsequent bids:
   - Initial bid: $200
   - Carmen's bids: $300, $350, $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1250 \]

So, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1250}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels:

\[ 30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance per week is:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance per year is:

\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is:

\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays for driving in a year:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"First, let's find out how long Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand how the pages are arranged after folding the paper. Each fold creates two pages, one on the left and one on the right. So, for a 32-page tabloid, we need to determine how many folds are required.

1. After the first fold, we have 2 pages (1 and 2).
2. After the second fold, we have 4 pages (1, 2, 3, and 4).
3. After the third fold, we have 8 pages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).
4. After the fourth fold, we have 16 pages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16).
5. After the fifth fold, we have 32 pages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32).

Since we need 32 pages, we need 5 folds. Each fold uses one piece of paper. Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 5.

"Annika started with $50.

She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides, so she had:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of books sold in the first year
Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since she sold 45 books this year, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books in the first year} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of books sold in the second year
We know the total number of books in the collection is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books} \]

We already know the number of books sold in the first and third years:
\[ 90 \text{ (first year)} + 45 \text{ (third year)} = 135 \text{ books} \]

So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 200 - 135 = 65 \text{ books} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the earnings for the second year
Each book sells for $20, so the earnings for the second year are:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \text{ dollars} \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Watson earns from his hourly wage each week. 

Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 50 \, \text{hours/week} \]

He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 50 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so his total earnings for April are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made:
\[ \$3200 \] in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This means that the remaining loaves are:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in one week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. So, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks).

Since Sandy loses weight at a rate that allows her to lose 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her to lose 8 pounds by dividing 8 pounds by the rate of 2 pounds per week:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Final answer:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2 per tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5 per packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To find out how many new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs that will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum makes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms will be \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum makes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs will be \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs will be the sum of the extra arms and legs.
   - So, \( 5 \) (extra arms) + \( 3 \) (extra legs) = \( 8 \) new limbs.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on buying gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{2050}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The rest of the family (which is 2 people) eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs each day.

Now, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"First, let's figure out Jane's age. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from 30.

\[ \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Since Jane is 27, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age.

\[ \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

So, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \(D\).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \(2D\).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \(\frac{1}{2}D\).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So, we can write the equation as:
\[D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[3.5D = 105\]

To find \(D\), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30\]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- Total people invited: 24
- People who couldn't come: 10

So, the number of people who show up is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

**Final Answer: 14**"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles.

Next, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He originally had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls there are in the classroom. Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 3 × Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 × 30
Number of girls = 90

Next, let's find out how many nongendered children there are. The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, this means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

If the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can find the number of electric poles by using the ratio.

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then we have:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's find the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
- There were 25 men and 15 women.
- So, the total number of people was \(25 + 15 = 40\).

Next, we need to find out how many people left after an hour. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left:
- \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) people left.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find out how many men left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men:
- \( 25 - 22 = 3 \) men left.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the rest must be women:
- \( 10 - 3 = 7 \) women left.

To find out how many women are left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
- \( 15 - 7 = 8 \) women are left.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and a book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together make 26 pencils. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 26.

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that Jam has 3 boxes and each box presumably holds the same number of pencils as the 2 loose pencils (which we can assume are the same as the pencils in the boxes), we can calculate the number of pencils per box. 

If 2 loose pencils are the same as the contents of one box, then each box holds 2 pencils. 

So, the total number of pencils per box is 2. 

To find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

\[ 72 \div 2 = 36 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 36 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
   \[
   \frac{65}{13} = 5
   \]
   So, Shannon uses 5 ice cubes.

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Trade Ratio**: For every 2 old records, people get 1 new record.

2. **Total New Records Traded For**: The 5 people leave with 7 new records.

3. **Calculating Old Records Traded For New Records**: Since 1 new record is given for every 2 old records, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:
   \[
   7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records}
   \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

This means there are 40 junior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month} \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplify the expression: \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that after these changes, there are 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation: \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation: \( x + 6 = 20 \). Subtract 6 from both sides: \( x = 20 - 6 \).

7. Therefore, \( x = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\):
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31

"To fully charge the phone, it needs to go from 60% to 100%. 

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. So, to find out how many minutes it will take to charge the remaining 40 percentage points, we can multiply 40 by 3 minutes.

\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\[ 120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops Erin has is:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

So, the number of $20 increments in $80 is:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \]

This means they earned $4 off their next purchase.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 off reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the reward off the price. So, the coupon took:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount they received:
\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this total discount from the amount they spent:
\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \]

So, the customer paid:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. So, the annual salary is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year. The state charges $6,000 in property tax, so the amount after property tax is:
\[ 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \text{ dollars} \]

The net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs. Job B has a higher net pay than Job A. The difference in net pay is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make \(\boxed{8400}\) dollars more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we need to find out how many of the 220 castles are ruins. Since 40 percent of them are ruins, we calculate:

\[ 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate:

\[ 88 \times 0.50 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 months * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 months * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's find out the total number of paintball guns they have together.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (the other one) has 5 guns.

So, the total number of guns is:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 of them.

To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar, 8 batches will require:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge. Since one batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar, 1 batch will require:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year.

1. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - Total initial investment = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

2. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year.
   - Increase in price = 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $4
   - New price per share = $8 + $4 = $12

3. After the first year, the value of the 8 shares is:
   - Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

4. In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.
   - Decrease in price = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
   - New price per share = $12 - $3 = $9

5. After the second year, the value of the 8 shares is:
   - Value after second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × 2
Thomas's hot dogs = 6

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

John's hot dogs = 1/2 × Thomas's hot dogs
John's hot dogs = 1/2 × 6
John's hot dogs = 3

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

More hot dogs John ate = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs
More hot dogs John ate = 3 - 2
More hot dogs John ate = 1

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students, will have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( 60 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has.

1. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

We know the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens, he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \] chickens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

- The total number of legs from the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

- The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. He practices for 4 weeks, so he adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks.

So, the number of balls he can juggle after 4 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ balls} + 1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls.
5. Out of the 3 dropped balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 is lost.

So, the number of balls lost is 1.

"The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage more they are making per day now compared to when they were making tractors.

The increase in daily earnings is:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Earnings}}{\text{Original Earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10\% \]"
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, the monthly cost of food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.

2. **The monthly cost of treats is $20.**

3. **The monthly cost of medicine is $100.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

5. **Calculate the yearly cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the yearly cost is \(220 \times 12 = 2640\) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find out how many hours all of Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then add them all together.

1. **Yoga Class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking Class on Tuesday**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class. So, it will be \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Cheese-Tasting Event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (which is half an hour)
4. **Museum Tour on Thursday**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class. So, it will be \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

Now, we add all these durations together:

\[1 \, \text{hour} + 3 \, \text{hours} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{hours}\]

So, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours."
"First, let's figure out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since they need twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they need 30 pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of pots for the roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pots for roses} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots required:

\[ \text{Total pots needed} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she bought:

\[ \text{Pots left over} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Andrea spent and gave away.
2. Subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the total amount Andrea spent and gave away:
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the initial amount of money she had:
- Andrea initially had $36.

So, the amount Andrea saved is:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spent 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spent half the time he spent boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time he spent on vacation as \( T \). We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount Dean spent on the toys. We add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17 on toys, the amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's assume Morgan is inviting \( x \) friends. The total cost for Morgan and her friends would be:
\[ 30 \times (x + 1) \]

Morgan's budget is $90, so we set up the equation:
\[ 30 \times (x + 1) \leq 90 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 1 \leq \frac{90}{30} \]
\[ x + 1 \leq 3 \]
\[ x \leq 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite up to 2 friends. 

**Final Answer:**
Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets in total over 5 days from her parents. Since she gets $5 every day, over 5 days she gets:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. So, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, she spends $1 each day on lollipops. Over 5 days, the total amount spent on lollipops is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money she saves each day, we subtract the amount spent on lollipops from the amount she gets each day:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, we can calculate the total cost of the gumballs as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05 \text{ per gumball} = \$2 \]

This means Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had after buying the candy must be $4 (because $2 is half of $4).

Now, let's determine how much money Billy spent on candy. He started with $10 and had $4 left after buying the gumballs, so the amount spent on candy is:

\[ \$10 - \$4 = \$6 \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Carver's son's age is \( x \) years.
2. According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, we can write the equation: \( 45 = 2x - 5 \).
3. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: \( 45 + 5 = 2x \).
4. This simplifies to \( 50 = 2x \).
5. Now, divide both sides by 2: \( \frac{50}{2} = x \).
6. This gives us \( 25 = x \).

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels between the three cities in one trip.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(100 + 75 - 50 = 125\) miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of 175 miles)

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

20"
"First, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To find out how long the trip took, we need to calculate the time for each part of the journey and then add them together.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Second Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times together:
- Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The trip took a total of 6 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are in total at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys)

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, to find out how many boys were present, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:

53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49 (boys present)

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together:

\[6 + 12 = 18\]

So, there are 18 kids in the park."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add up the points she has already scored and then see how many more points she needs to reach the total of 42 points.

1. Jane's score on the first test: 15 points
2. Jane's score on the second test: 18 points

First, we add these two scores together:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach 42 points:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that four times the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5 equals the number of shoplifters. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

Number of shoplifters = 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, we calculate:

Number of people for physical violence = 3 * 7 = 21

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can find out how many were kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

Number of people for other reasons = Total - (Customers + Shoplifters + Physical violence)
Number of people for other reasons = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's figure out how many points Erin has now. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points, so three times Sara's points would be:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin now has 24 points. Since Erin scored 14 points to reach this total, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors.

\[ \text{Cost of picture frames} = 44 \times 20 = 880 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching cost is 20% of the frame's cost.

\[ \text{Etching cost per frame} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

So, the total etching cost for all frames is:

\[ \text{Total etching cost} = 44 \times 4 = 176 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5.

\[ \text{Cost of pins} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \text{Number of officers} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ \text{Cost of cords} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1298 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1298} \]"
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

First, we calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper.

Now, we subtract the savings from the original price to find the total cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 100 \]"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours from each day she practiced.

1. On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of dance practice.
2. On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
3. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's class. Since Tuesday's class was 1 hour, Saturday's class was \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

Total hours = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

So, Hallie had dance practice for 5 hours a week.

"First, we need to find out the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment was faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000.

\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total amount minus the value of the faulty pieces.

\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them produce 1 kg of milk each, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \(30 \div 2 = 15\) sheep.

Now, calculate the milk from each group:
- From the 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each, she gets \(15 \times 1 = 15\) kg of milk.
- From the 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each, she gets \(15 \times 2 = 30\) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk from both groups to find the total amount of milk collected every day:
- Total milk = \(15 + 30 = 45\) kg.

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, the number of rolls left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is:
48"
"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue.

Next, we need to find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue. We subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. We calculate one-fourth of the 20 pupils:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, 5 pupils like green.

Finally, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday by dividing the total money by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we add up the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"First, let's figure out how many socks Lindsay has washed. Since 1 pair of socks consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means she has washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks. Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is \(20 + 15 = 35\).

Lindsay started with 50 socks. If she has washed 35 socks, the number of socks she has missed is \(50 - 35 = 15\).

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, the total number of cookies Rachel had before her brother ate some is:

23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Her brother then ate 44 cookies. So, the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten by her brother) = 21 cookies

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she has to repay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan is for 5 months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to adjust it for 5 months.

The formula to calculate the interest for a specific period is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% per year (or 0.10), and the time is 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan has to repay is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 = 3802.085 \]

Now, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find out how much she has to pay per month:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

For silver pesos:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

For gold pesos:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[ 350 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Millie will make from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost of making the lemonade. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

This is the total profit from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, the time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's assume the total land Mr. Ruther had initially is \( x \) hectares.
2. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. According to the problem, the land left is 12.8 hectares. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, we can isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of boys and girls as follows:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so 26 girls are initially planning to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 1/2 * 26 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Final numerical answer:
16"

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

**Final Answer: 80**"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.
- So, the total cost for the erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.
- So, the total cost for the pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- The total cost is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet.

The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, the cost per ride for Dasha is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride} \]

Since Dasha needs to ride 9 rides, the total cost for her is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Now, let's compare the total cost for both David and Dasha.

David's total cost with the bracelet is $30.
Dasha's total cost with tickets is $36.

The amount David saves by buying the bracelet instead of individual tickets is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, let's find out the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica needs to wrap 12 gifts in total.

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, and then find the difference between the number of popsicles they have.

1. First, we know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

2. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. This total can be represented as the sum of the parts of the ratio. Since the ratio is 5:6, the total parts are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

3. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
   \[
   \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
   \]

4. Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have:
   - Betty has 5 parts, so:
     \[
     \text{Betty's popsicles} = 5 \times 15 = 75
     \]
   - Sam has 6 parts, so:
     \[
     \text{Sam's popsicles} = 6 \times 15 = 90
     \]

5. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15
   \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of Netflix:
- Netflix costs $10 a month.

Next, we calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the bundle discount:
- Each service normally costs $10 a month.
- So, the total for Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 a month.

Now, let's find out the discount Tim gets by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus:
- He saves 20% on the combined cost of $20.
- 20% of $20 is calculated as \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \).

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount is:
- $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

Now, we add the cost of Netflix and the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 a month.

Finally, we calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package:
- The total cost of the streaming services is $26 a month.
- The cable package cost $60 a month.
- Therefore, the savings are $60 - $26 = $34.

**Final Answer:**
Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package."
"First, let's calculate the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Next, we add up the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"First, let's find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that the system can hold. So, we need to calculate double the number of books and then add 20 to it:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's see how many cards Erica passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards Erica passed out is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards Erica has:

- She started with 50 cards.
- She passed out 29 cards.
- She received 17 cards.

The net change is \(50 - 29 + 17\).

Calculating this, we get:
\[50 - 29 = 21\]
\[21 + 17 = 38\]

So, Erica now has \(\boxed{38}\) Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total slices:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the remaining slices:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the final number of slices left is:

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy the bike, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of money Mark needs to save: $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount in the bank) = $250.
2. Calculate how many days it will take for Mark to save $250 if he earns $10 per day: $250 ÷ $10/day = 25 days.

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days. 

25"
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * Number of spiders
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90
Number of millipedes = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate it as:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 60 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 48

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total number of bugs = 168

So, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs."

- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, let's find Beth's age:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Next, let's find Alice's age:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, we calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.**

The builder works for 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
So, the number of days worked in a month is:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the number of days worked in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the year.**

The builder gets paid $50 every day, so the total earnings for the year are:
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"First, let's calculate the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Now, let's determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- Each bag contains 2 cups
- Number of bags needed: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

For milk:
- Each bottle contains 2 cups
- Number of bottles needed: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

- Difference: \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4\)

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"First, let's calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day before the reduction.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour and is used for 8 hours a day. So, the daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and the new daily usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"First, let's find out how many stripes each zebra has:

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, for these two zebras, the total number of stripes is:
   \[
   17 \times 2 = 34
   \]

2. There is a zebra with 36 stripes.

3. There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. So, the number of stripes on this zebra is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. We do this by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 4:
\[
\frac{88}{4} = 22
\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is:
\[
22

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

- 5 pounds of meat
- 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost for the meat is:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost for the cheese is:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives the total cost:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[ \$50.00 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many corns Allan originally has. Since there are twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 × Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 × 40
Number of corns = 80

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:

New number of cannolis = Original number of cannolis + 60
New number of cannolis = 40 + 60
New number of cannolis = 100

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

Number of corns bought = 60 - 40
Number of corns bought = 20

Now, we add the corns he originally had to the corns he bought to find the total number of corns:

Total number of corns = Original number of corns + Number of corns bought
Total number of corns = 80 + 20
Total number of corns = 100

Finally, we add the total number of corns and cannolis to find the combined total:

Combined total = Total number of corns + New number of cannolis
Combined total = 100 + 100
Combined total = 200

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps just for these walks.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps before his jog are:

5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he had already taken:

10,000 (total steps goal) - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had already taken from the total steps he had taken before his jog:

8,000 (total steps before jog) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Since he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he needs to leave his house is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, the time he will leave his house is:

\[ 70 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each earning $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 40 employees, the total weekly payment for all employees is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since May typically has 4 weeks, the total payment for May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

This means that the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still $600. Therefore, the total weekly payment for all employees in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since June also typically has 4 weeks, the total payment for June is:
\[ 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is:
\[ \boxed{168000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's find out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ \$400 + \$800 = \$1200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the fireworks before the discount. We add the cost of the finale firework:

\[ \$1200 + \$150 = \$1350 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. We calculate 80% of \$1350:

\[ 0.80 \times \$1350 = \$1080 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \$1080 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. 

To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the percentage of candles that will explode:**
   - Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles do not explode. This means that 1% of her candles will explode.
   - To find out how many candles will explode, we calculate 1% of 50,000 candles:
     \[
     1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \text{ candles}
     \]

2. **Determine the percentage of candles that will smell like wet dog:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Since we are only considering the candles that will explode, we need to find 5% of the 500 candles that will explode:
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles}
     \]

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, we need to find the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we calculate 30% of $20.

30% of $20 = 0.30 × $20 = $6

So, the discount price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

Total cost = 4 × $14 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:

- Joanne's total: \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\), where \(x\) is the number of apples gathered from the average trees.
- Her sister's total: \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer: 350**"
"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

1. Camels have 2 humps each.
2. Dromedaries have 1 hump each.
3. There are 180 heads in total, which means there are 180 animals in total (since each animal has one head).
4. There are 304 bumps (humps) in total.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since the total number of heads is 180)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, and the total number of humps is 304)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so:

\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so:

\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) cubic inches.

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"First, we need to determine the elevation of the comb after it fell. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the comb's elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, and the comb is at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Therefore, the number of feet Oliver must climb is:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money the second bank gave Mr. Josue.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.
3. Calculate the total capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

So, the number of cats left after the boats took some away is:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final answer:
12 cats"
"To find out how much 2 years of the streaming service cost Bill, we need to break down the costs month by month.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256

"First, let's find the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to determine the total savings Cole made. The problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them. Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 24 - 28 = -4 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we take the absolute value:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder.

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders.

- Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
- Lillian has 3 store-bought bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Now, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.

- Total number of birds = \(90 + 60 = 150\).

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"First, let's find out the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, let's find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has left after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling his cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - So, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"First, let's figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. According to the problem, he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since he was initially told to cater for 36 guests, half of these guests would be:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So, 18 guests were supposed to have two hotdogs each. This means the caterer prepared:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that each of the 40 guests would want a second hotdog, which would require:

\[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ additional hotdogs} \]

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, the number of additional hotdogs needed is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

Therefore, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Final answer:
4 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's find out how many letters are in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Dora saved: $2
- Her mother gave her: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we determine how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"First, let's find out how much gas each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 3 gallons:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since 1% of his money was left, the 120 cents represent the remaining 99% of his money. Let's find out how much 1% is:

\[ \text{1% of his money} = \frac{120 \text{ cents}}{99} \]

Now, let's find out how much money George originally had. Since 120 cents is 99% of his money, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.99 \times \text{original amount} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

\[ \text{original amount} = \frac{120 \text{ cents}}{0.99} \approx 121.21 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had approximately 121.21 cents left, the amount he actually spent is:

\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 121.21 \text{ cents} \approx 378.79 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know he spent 120 cents on chips, so the amount spent on candy bars is:

\[ 378.79 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} \approx 258.79 \text{ cents} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{258.79 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents/bar}} \approx 3.45 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 3 candy bars.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 3 \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops by the number of friends:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."
"First, we need to find out how much each piece of the cake weighs. Since the cake is divided into 8 equal pieces and the total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, we divide 20 by 8:

\[ \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total. The weight of the 2 pieces is:

\[ 2.5 \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

The original cake weighed 20 ounces. After Rory and her mom each took a piece, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together.

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people in total (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:
\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, so he needs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Next, the cost of beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of onions and beef stock to find the total cost: \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is \(\frac{12}{6} = 2\) dollars.

Therefore, the cost per serving is \(2\) dollars."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. We know that Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes. Now, we know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's 4-minute drive time. So, we calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before the theater opens:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 9 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter formula is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

- Red beads: \(1 \text{ pack} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 20 \text{ beads}\)
- Clear beads: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 40 \text{ beads}\)

Adding these together, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[20 \text{ beads} + 40 \text{ beads} = 60 \text{ beads}\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Using the same calculation method:

- Blue beads: \(3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads}\)
- Red beads: \(4 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 80 \text{ beads}\)

Adding these together, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[60 \text{ beads} + 80 \text{ beads} = 140 \text{ beads}\]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. We subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth bought from the total number of beads Margareth bought:
\[140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads}\]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Final numerical answer:
\[80\]"

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
   - Total temperature decrease = 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time was:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate James's time for each segment of the triathlon.

- Swim: James is 10% faster, so he takes 90% of Jon's swim time.
\[ 40 \times 0.9 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- Bike ride: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the total time for the swim and bike ride:
\[ 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how long it took James to run, we subtract the time for the swim and bike ride from his total time:
\[ 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's find out how long Movie C is. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Now, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, let's find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH), we can calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given that 30 minutes is half an hour, we can substitute the values:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
2

"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after his turn in Scrabble. Joey originally has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

So, Joey's new score is 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy originally has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy's new score is 235 points.

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points.

**Final Answer: 5**"
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all sales is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find out how many colors of crayons Beatrice bought in all, we need to calculate the total number of crayons from the two different packets separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons from the six packets that each had eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons from the four packets that each had sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons."
"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - So, \( (15 + P) - 21 = 2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( 15 + P - 21 = 2 \)
   - \( P - 6 = 2 \)
   - \( P = 2 + 6 \)
   - \( P = 8 \)

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, let's find the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. So, the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We do this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 \]

To calculate this, we can break it down:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the distance for the first part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Calculate the distance for the second part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total Distance = Distance of first part + Distance of second part = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total Time = Time of first part + Time of second part = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. She starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, she receives 2 rubies in the trade. Now, let's calculate the total value of her sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of the 2 rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.

Together, in 30 days, Marin and Nancy eat \(120 + 120 = 240\) apples.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. So, for one raised bed:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil needed} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. We know there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than red cards.

To find 60% of 15, we calculate:
\[ 15 \times \frac{60}{100} = 15 \times 0.6 = 9 \]

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's find the total number of puppies from both Jennifer and Brandon.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying.

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds

3. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Next, we add up the total weight of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number because even a fraction of a trip means an additional trip is needed.

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth two cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

So, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants."

So, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. Finley started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible place, which is 100. So, she is now in 100th place.
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 2 = 98\). So, she is now in 98th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 + 3 = 101\). Again, since there are only 100 spots, we adjust this to the last possible place, which is 100. So, she is now in 100th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(100 - 1 = 99\). So, she is now in 99th place.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he adds 10 shoes to his collection.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

- Starting shoes: 200
- Shoes added on Monday: 10
- Shoes added on Wednesday: 30
- Shoes added on Friday: 60
- Shoes removed on Saturday: 180

Total shoes before Saturday's removal: 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks.
2. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the number of cookies he can have is given by the formula: \(\frac{x}{2} + 2\).
3. We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation: \(\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5\).

Now, let's solve the equation for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

"First, let's find the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 12 \, \text{inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 120 \, \text{inches} \]

Now, to find what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the ""Part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""Whole"" is the shark's body length (120 inches). So, we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{120 \, \text{inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we first need to figure out the total number of days he has to walk and then divide the total time by the number of days.

1. **Calculate the total number of days in three weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in three weeks, there are \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Determine the number of days he can walk:**
   - Jason can walk 4 days a week.
   - In three weeks, he can walk \(3 \times 4 = 12\) days.

3. **Calculate the total walking time:**
   - It takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes.

4. **Calculate the time he needs to walk each day:**
   - Total time to break in the shoes: 240 minutes.
   - Number of days he can walk: 12 days.
   - Time per day: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \).

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"First, we need to find out how many books Sarah bought. We do this by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

So, Sarah bought 20 books. Now, we need to divide these books equally among her 4 kids:

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Each child got 5 books.

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the things (dairy or peanuts).

1. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts.
2. However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. If we just add 9 and 6, we would be counting those 3 kids twice. So, we need to subtract the 3 kids who are allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

So, the number of kids allergic to at least one of the things is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we know there are 32 kids in total. To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:
\[ 621 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we calculate:
\[ \text{Jasper's blue paint tubes} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Jasper's yellow paint tubes} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, to find the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together:
\[ \text{Total paint tubes} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we need to find the combined weight of both pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first need to add the amounts they have already earned and then subtract that total from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. So, the total amount they have earned by 3 pm is:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

So, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs they currently have from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

\[
= \frac{2 \times 60}{5}
\]

\[
= \frac{120}{5}
\]

\[
= 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
\text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10
\]

\[
= 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"First, we need to find out how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we calculate:

3 times $80 = $240

Now, we know that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than this amount. So, we subtract $20 from $240:

$240 - $20 = $220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"First, let's calculate the total miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles each day for 5 days, so:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the total hours by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume in a day. Since there are four horses, the total consumption is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats the horses consume in five days. So, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are required to feed the horses for five days. We divide the total pounds of oats needed by the pounds per bag:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we need to find out how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

\[
\text{Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.}
\]"
"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the highest temperatures of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia.
2. Divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sum of the highest temperatures:
   - Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

   Sum = -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit

2. Divide the sum by the number of countries:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{-30}{3} = -10 \text{ degrees Fahrenheit}
   \]

So, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to find out how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, we subtract the amount saved from the cost of the toy car:

$12 - $4 = $8

The child needs to save $8 more. If the child saves $2 each day, we can find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8 by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total capacity of the trays is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's find out how much the family-size pizza costs. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, we can calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza together:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's figure out the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts.

Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs would normally cost:
\[ 2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. So, the cost for 2 packs is:
\[ \$4.00 \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:
\[ \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00 \]

This $2.00 is the total cost for 2 packs of razors after the coupon. Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Since there are 4 razors in each pack and she is buying 2 packs, she is getting:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:
\[ \$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid would be the height of the shortest cheerleader because they are at the top. 

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old in four years.
4. If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\) years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old. 

Angela's current age is 38."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He did this for 14 days.

So, the total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He did this for 14 days.

So, the total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box. So, Ashley brought:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, Brianne brought:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, we have:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person for the venue and the food is already included, so the total cost is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) where these two costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 2B = 43 - 7 \]
\[ 2B = 36 \]
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. Now we can find out how many insects David found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

And how many insects Lily found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found \(\boxed{16}\) insects."
"First, we need to find out how much yarn Mariah and her grandma used individually and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate the amount Mariah used as follows:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. We calculate the amount her grandma used as follows:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts for Cherrie's friends:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts for her friends is \(10 + 6 = 16\) gifts.

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total:

\(16 + 10 = 26\)

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"First, let's find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:

\[ 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug first:

\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Then, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

\[ 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the couch is 18 feet long."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.
5. She paid $7 in all.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"First, let's determine the cost and stick yield for each type of wood:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Since Frederick has $24 to spend, we need to see how many of each type of wood he can buy with this budget.

If he buys only 2 x 4 pieces:
- Each 2 x 4 costs $4, so with $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces.
- This would give him \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

If he buys only 2 x 8 pieces:
- Each 2 x 8 costs $6, so with $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces.
- This would give him \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood yields more sticks per dollar, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible with his budget.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

1600"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs Mario's sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can find the number of pairs needed by dividing the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips without the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, let's see how much she would spend if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20. The cost with the pass is:
\[ \$20.00 \]

To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost with the pass from the cost without the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo.

For the farm:
\[ 30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals} \]

For the zoo:
\[ 60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals} \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to work backwards from the information given about Rose's purchases.

1. **Rose's Purchases:**
   - Rose bought 12 onions.
   - Rose bought 4 potatoes.

2. **Relationship Between Sophia's and Rose's Purchases:**
   - Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

3. **Calculating Sophia's Purchases:**
   - Since Rose bought 12 onions, which is 4 times what Sophia bought, we can find out how many onions Sophia bought by dividing 12 by 4.
     \[
     \text{Onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Similarly, since Rose bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought, we can find out how many potatoes Sophia bought by dividing 4 by 4.
     \[
     \text{Potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
     \]

4. **Total Purchases by Sophia:**
   - To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes together.
     \[
     \text{Total} = 3 \text{ onions} + 1 \text{ potato} = 4
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:

\[ 3500 \, \text{calories/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 105,000 \, \text{calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal. Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

- From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July up to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these up:

\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \, \text{days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day. We do this by dividing the total number of calories by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105,000 \, \text{calories}}{190 \, \text{days}} \approx 552.63 \, \text{calories/day} \]

So, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal. 

Final answer:
\[ 553 \, \text{calories/day} \]"
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings for the week by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in a week.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings.

\[ \text{Amount left} = 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she runs 2 km, we multiply the distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah will need to drink \(\boxed{120}\) milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \) dollars.
2. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is \( 3L \) dollars.
3. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + 3L = 120,000
   \]
4. Combining like terms, we get:
   \[
   4L = 120,000
   \]
5. To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
   \]
6. Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
   \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for all the bags is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in a fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, a fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total number of minutes in a fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Joe throws 25 punches per minute. So, the total number of punches he throws in 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Therefore, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ 375 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Now, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Royce. According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. Double the time Rob takes is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes. Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

So, Royce takes \(\boxed{280}\) minutes to shingle a house."
"First, let's calculate the number of skeins needed for one set of winter wear for a grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Now, let's add these up for one grandchild:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha is making these for 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:
21 (skeins per grandchild) × 3 (grandchildren) = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
   - Remaining problems: \(100 - 12 = 88\)
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - Problems completed on Tuesday: \(3 \times 12 = 36\)
   - Remaining problems: \(88 - 36 = 52\)
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - Problems completed on Wednesday: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\)
   - Remaining problems: \(52 - 13 = 39\)

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is \(\boxed{39}\)."
"First, let's find out how many quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour.

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts they can pick per hour together:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

- In the morning, they sold 93 loaves.
- In the afternoon, they sold 39 loaves.

So, the total number of loaves sold is:
\[ 93 + 39 = 132 \]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves were left after the sales:

- They initially baked 200 loaves.
- After selling 132 loaves, the number of loaves left is:
\[ 200 - 132 = 68 \]

Then, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, we add these 6 loaves to the remaining loaves:

\[ 68 + 6 = 74 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:
\[ 74 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} \]

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips to find the total number of rows:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows of flowers} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much of the raisins will be used for each item if Heather divides the bag equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Since there are 3 items and the raisins are divided equally, each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, we can calculate the number of batches by dividing the total cups of raisins for the cookies by the amount needed per batch:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \, \text{per week} \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her new daily consumption in kilowatt-hours is:
\[ (12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour}) \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her new weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is still $1.50, so her new weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, we find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take:
\[ 5 \, \text{days} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{days} \]

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to do the same job.

Since 5 people are working together, they can do the work 5 times faster than one person. So, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ \frac{10 \, \text{days}}{5} = 2 \, \text{days} \]

Now, we need to convert 2 days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \, \text{days} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 48 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48 hours"
"First, let's figure out how many chairs Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 \]

So,

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} \]

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So,

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. We add up all the sofas and chairs:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Finally, we add the total number of sofas and chairs together:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"First, we need to find out the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the total amount of money Tom had by the cost of one CD:

Total money - Cost of headphone set = Remaining money
$48 - $44 = $4

Now, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought:

Remaining money / Cost of CD = Number of additional CDs
$4 / $4 = 1

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
1"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, except for some weeks where he worked out for more hours. Let's calculate the total hours step by step.

1. For 8 weeks, working out 4 hours each week:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \)

2. He worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks:
   \( 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \)

3. He worked out for 6 hours in one week:
   \( 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \)

Now, we add all these hours together:
\( 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[

"First, let's figure out Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, that means he is currently \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

Next, we need to determine Jame's age in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

The question states that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\). Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55. So, Jame's cousin is currently \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old.

Now, we need to find the age difference between Jame and his cousin now. The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

Now, let's find the cost of the printer:
- Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Next, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the total cost of the 2 monitors:
- Total cost = Cost of computer + Cost of printer + Cost of 2 monitors
- $2,400 = $1,100 + $700 + Cost of 2 monitors

Now, let's solve for the cost of the 2 monitors:
- $2,400 = $1,800 + Cost of 2 monitors
- Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Since the cost is for 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor:
- Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2 = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought back 60 (the same as the boys) + 4 * 60 seashells.

Calculating the number of seashells the girls brought:
4 * 60 = 240
60 + 240 = 300

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies."
"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Total vlogs made in the first three weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to understand the structure of the month and his saving plan.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month consists of the first 15 days, and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount saved in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

According to the problem, in the second half of April, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half. The total amount saved in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, he saves:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches that Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
   - Total cost for apples = 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
   - Total cost for oranges = 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   - Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
   - Total cost for peaches = 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost
- Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns from 20 tasks. Since Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, we multiply $0.8 by 20:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, Jairus earns $16.

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns from 20 tasks. Since Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, we multiply $0.5 by 20:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, Jenny earns $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Brad gets \( x \) dollars.
2. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4x \) dollars.
3. Together, they have 100 dollars, so we can write the equation: \( x + 4x = 100 \).
4. This simplifies to \( 5x = 100 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5: \( x = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \).

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day. That means he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, which is a total of 6 miles per day.

If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is:

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - So far, Elise has written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything: \(65\) letters.

4. **Total number of letters written:**
   - Adding the re-written letters to the previous total: \(65 + 65 = 130\).

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is **130**."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the phone tree works and how many families are notified in each round.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

1. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.
2. Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.
3. His final weight is 70 pounds.

To find his initial weight, we add the total weight lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"First, let's figure out how many toys are in a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times that amount is:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x + 2 = 400 \). To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from 400:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 each = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25 each = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12 each = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10 each = $10.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:

Final amount = $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered.

1. The cost of the hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20\)
2. The cost of the potato fries: \(10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$3\)
3. The cost of the fruit drinks: \(5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10\)

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33
\]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find out how much change she gets back:
\[
\$50 - \$33 = \$17
\]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For the amount over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission.

Let's calculate each part:

1. Commission for the first $1000:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

2. The amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]

3. Commission for the amount over $1000:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

4. Total commission:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Antonella earned a total of $450."
"First, let's calculate how many water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles Bill needs in total for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We know that when the water is warm, Ray takes 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice this time is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us the time it takes in warm water: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes for a mile.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.

On a cold day, for 3 miles, Ray takes \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

On a hot day, for 3 miles, Ray takes \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes on a hot day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day: \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

So, the total cost for your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]
\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]
\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's figure out how much coffee Octavia drinks daily. Since the daily recommended amount is 4 cups and Octavia drinks half of that, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we need to find Bob's weight. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the angle of the sun changes over time. Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees straight upward every hour.

If the sun moves for 10 hours, the total angle it will move upward is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at 32 degrees and moves 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's figure out the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the second son is:

12 - 4 = 8 years old

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he has two sons, he needs:

12 candles (for the 12-year-old) + 8 candles (for the 8-year-old) = 20 candles

Next, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

20 candles ÷ 5 candles/pack = 4 packs

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so:

4 packs × $3/pack = $12

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the reading rate in pages per minute:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} \text{ pages/minute} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week by multiplying the reading time by the reading rate:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches they consumed:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Finally, to find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches they ate from the original number of sandwiches:

\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let's say Shiloh's nephew is \( x \) years old today.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.
4. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can write the equation: \( 51 = 3(x + 7) \).

Now, let's solve the equation step by step:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth each got $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to first figure out how many goals Mark and Anna scored based on the information given.

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

Now, we add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
- Richie: 80 goals
- Mark: 60 goals
- Anna: 35 goals

Total goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[80 + 60 + 35 = 175\]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 from his lemonade stand. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's figure out how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide $70 by 7:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day.

Next, we calculate how much he spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), and he spends $10 each day, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of action figures he buys. He bought 4 wooden action figures (one each day from Sunday to Wednesday) and 15 plastic action figures (from Thursday to Saturday). Therefore, the total number of action figures is:

\[ 4 + 15 = 19 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 19 \]"
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up all the expenses.

1. The cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. The cost of 3 vaccines, each costing $20: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)
3. The cost of 4 broken vases, each costing $12: \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[200 + 60 + 48 = 308\]

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week.

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops each week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many more roses he needs to supply the flower shops each week, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \]

This means Ford lacks 25 roses each week to supply all the flower shops.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total number of roses Ford lacks in a month by multiplying the weekly shortage by 4:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \]

So, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account in 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from her initial amount in the account.

First, let's find out how much money Katina removes in 2 years. Since she removes $100 every month, we need to know how many months are in 2 years:

\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount removed over 24 months:

\[ 24 \text{ months} \times \$100/\text{month} = \$2400 \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount in the account:

\[ \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

So, after 2 years, the amount of money remaining in Katina's savings account is:

\[ \$600 \]"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
     - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

**Final numerical answer:**
$37.00"
"First, let's find out how many crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each.

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin.

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, Kate can make $36."
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is found by multiplying the length by the width.

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new carpet, including the padding. The cost per square foot for the carpet and padding is $12 + $2 = $14.

\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$14/\text{square foot} = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the contractor to remove the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot.

\[ \text{Cost to remove old carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost for the contractor to install the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot.

\[ \text{Cost to install new carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the carpet and padding, the cost to remove the old carpet, and the cost to install the new carpet.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Add up the total number of birds seen over the week.**
   - Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

   Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

2. **Count the number of days.**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Calculate the average number of birds seen per day.**
   - Average = Total number of birds / Number of days
   - Average = 280 / 7 = 40

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10. So, 20 + 10 = 30.
3. She then divides this result by 5. So, 30 ÷ 5 = 6.
4. Next, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 - 12 = 8. Now, 6 × 8 = 48.

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards. Together, they have \(5 + 2 = 7\) cards.

"First, let's find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\). The percentage by which the oven is off is calculated as:

\[
\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after being 4% higher. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \(x\). The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
x \times 1.04 = 520
\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 1.04:

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together.

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- So, 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- So, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies together:
- 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

215 minutes"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the price of Herb's house.

1. First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together:

- Total utensils: \(52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\)

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's find out how many contacts Pete uses per day. Since 90 contacts last him 45 days, we can divide the total number of contacts by the number of days to find the daily usage:

\[ \frac{90 \text{ contacts}}{45 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ contacts/day} \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, he will have:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 90 \text{ contacts/box} = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of 2 boxes with the current discount. The original price for 2 boxes is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$100.00/\text{box} = \$200.00 \]

Since there is a 10% discount, the discount amount is:

\[ 10\% \times \$200.00 = 0.10 \times \$200.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the discounted price for 2 boxes is:

\[ \$200.00 - \$20.00 = \$180.00 \]

Now, to find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:

\[ \frac{\$180.00}{180 \text{ contacts}} = \$1.00/\text{contact} \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:

\[ \$1.00/\text{contact} \times 2 \text{ contacts/pair} = \$2.00/\text{pair} \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Now, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running.
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we can set up a proportion:

- For every 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} \).

Now, let's calculate the amount of water:
- \( \frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800 \text{ ml} \).

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be written as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be written as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Final answer:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's identify the three typing speeds Jared has:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After another increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

So, we add the three measurements together:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52

   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\)

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of these people will also invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited through this method is:

\[ 100 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ (each person + their 2 friends)} = 300 \text{ people} \]

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and invites them. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people from this method is:

\[ 10 \text{ friends} + 8 \text{ spouses} = 18 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people from both methods to find the total number of people who will attend the event:

\[ 300 \text{ people} + 18 \text{ people} = 318 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the cost of shipping on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
- So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the height of the beanstalk changes each day. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- **Day 0**: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1**: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- **Day 2**: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- **Day 3**: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet. Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Final answer:

"First, let's find out how much protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms.

We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, 200 grams would have twice as much protein because 200 is double 100.

\[ 3 \, \text{grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms every day.

Now, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we need to multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

\[ 6 \, \text{grams of protein/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( x \) years.
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( x - 5 \) years.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation: \( x = 2 \times (x - 5) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ x = 2 \times (x - 5) \]
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
\[ x - 2x = -10 \]
\[ -x = -10 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

4. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for the porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\).
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
- \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees
- \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
   \[
   8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
   \[
   6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[
   14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[
   15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we add up all the cents Colby has:
\[
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}
\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
\[
345 \div 5 = 69
\]

So, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."

"First, let's calculate how much money Patrick earned in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup.

For the first four hours:
- Number of cups sold per hour: 15
- Price per cup: $0.50
- Total cups sold in four hours: \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}\)
- Total earnings in four hours: \(60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30\)

Next, let's calculate how much money Patrick earned in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.

For the next two hours:
- Number of cups sold per hour: 10
- Price per cup: $0.60
- Total cups sold in two hours: \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}\)
- Total earnings in two hours: \(20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12\)

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings over the 6 hours.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tire will need to be replaced in \boxed{6} years."
"First, let's determine how many washings one pump of shampoo will provide. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find out how many washings one pump will give by dividing 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of one pump. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of washings per pump, and then by the number of pumps needed for one washing (which is 1 in this case):

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we want the cost in cents, we convert 0.20 dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $25:
\[ 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts originally cost $35. Since there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, they will remain at $35.

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the shirt and shorts is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the problem setup, we can still calculate how much he would be short.

The amount Joe would be short is:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks how much money Joe will have left, and he cannot afford the items, the answer is that he will have:
\[ 0 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's find out how much butter Juan needs for one day. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, and he wants to make 4 dozen a day, we can calculate the butter needed for one day as follows:

\[ \text{Butter needed per day} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound} \]

\[ \text{Butter needed per day} = 1 \text{ pound} \]

Now, Juan wants to make croissants for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we need to find out how much butter he will need for the whole week:

\[ \text{Butter needed for a week} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Butter needed for a week} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 194 \times 150 \]

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 29100 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 194 \times 490 \]

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 95060 \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:

\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 95060 - 29100 \]

\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 65960 \]

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Total Duration of Research:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months.

- **Month 41:** $145,610,960,751.23 * 1.5 = $218,416,441,126.84
- **Month 42:** $218,416,441,126.84 * 1.5 = $327,624,661,685.26
- **Month 43:** $327,624,661,685.26 * 1.5 = $491,436,992,527.89
- **Month 44:** $491,436,992,527.89 * 1.5 = $737,155,488,791.84
- **Month 45:** $737,155,488,791.84 * 1.5 = $1,105,733,233,187.76

Now, we sum up all the costs:

- Initial 5 months: $100,000
- Remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + ... + $1,105,733,233,187.76

The sum of the series for the remaining 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[ S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Where:
- \( a = 150,000 \) (first term after the first 5 months)
- \( r = 1.5 \) (common ratio)
- \( n = 45 \) (number of terms)

\[ S = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]

\[ S = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]

\[ S = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Using a calculator to find \( 1.5^{45} \):

\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,188,137,744,000 \]

\[ S \approx 300,000 (1,188,137,744,000 - 1) \]

\[ S \approx 300,000 \times 1,188,137,743,999 \]

\[ S \approx 356,441,323,199,700,000 \]

Finally, adding the initial 5 months:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 356,441,323,199,700,000 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} \approx 356,441,323,200,800,000 \]

So, the total cost of the research is approximately $356,441,323,200,800,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. So, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts 3 times a day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. Therefore, for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each
   - Total for rocks: \(2 \times 2.50 = 5.00\)
3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   - Total for coral: \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\)
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each
   - Total for fish: \(20 \times 0.50 = 10.00\)
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00
\]

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate how much meat Prince sells in a day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day. So, the amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

\[ \text{Answer: } 5 \, \text{days} \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

So, 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. The remaining seats after the administrators and parents took their seats are:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at all the intersections.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights per intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then add them together.

For the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 356 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

For the second DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 135 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times = 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
2. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
3. The cost of the sessions is $125 per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total hours John spent in physical therapy:

- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went twice a week, so each week he spent \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in therapy.
- Over 6 weeks, he spent \(4 \times 6 = 24\) hours in total.

Next, we calculate the total cost:

- The cost per hour is $125.
- For 24 hours, the total cost is \(24 \times 125 = 3000\).

So, the total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we add the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's:

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the pieces he chews at school to the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner to find the total number of pieces he has chewed by the end of the day:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Final answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. 

To find out how old she is now, we subtract 12 years from 16:
16 - 12 = 4 years old now.

To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:
4 + 4 = 8 years old.

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find the total number of flowers Arianna planted. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. So, we calculate 4/5 of 200:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's convert Ashley's internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.

1. We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb.
2. Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second.
3. To convert kb to Mb, we divide by 1000: \( \frac{20 \, \text{kb}}{1000} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb per second} \).

Next, let's find out how much data she can download in one hour.

1. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.
2. If Ashley's speed is 0.02 Mb per second, then in one hour, she can download \( 0.02 \, \text{Mb/second} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds} \).

Now, let's calculate the total Mb per hour:

\[ 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \, \text{Mb per hour} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars the tow truck towed in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled ten cars each day for three days, we multiply 10 by 3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days. The tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days, so it towed \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day for the remaining four days. We multiply 6 by 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed in the week:
\[ 30 + 24 = 54 \]

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \text{Height needed in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

4"
"First, let's calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the cars. Since the company paid 30% of the price of each car, and each car costs $25,000, the cost per car is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for the company is:

\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total revenue is:

\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap at this rate. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can find the number of fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to 11.

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's find out the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. The total cost for the classes is $60.

To find the cost per class, we divide the total cost by the number of classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6 \text{ per class} \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will still sign him up for the classes even if he misses some.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes. Let's denote the number of classes he can miss as \( x \).

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this case would be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ \$60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ \$60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ -\$40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]

So, \( x \) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ customers daily} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

For Jewel:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

For Julie:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

Now, we add the weekly totals to find the combined total for both Julie and Jewel:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so:
\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular hole can be found by multiplying its length, width, and depth. So, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, so:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total cost of the truck:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 43500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

1. Calculate the raise amount:
\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 1000 \]

2. Add the raise to his original salary to get the new monthly salary:
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, let's calculate the bonus he receives, which is half a month's salary.

3. Calculate the bonus:
\[ \text{Bonus} = 21000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10500 \]

Now, let's find out his total monthly income including the bonus.

4. Total monthly income:
\[ \text{Total monthly income} = 21000 + 10500 = 31500 \]

Finally, let's calculate his annual income.

5. Annual income:
\[ \text{Annual income} = 31500 \times 12 = 378000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
Since he buys 10 dress pants:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the news website:
- The news website publishes 20 articles every day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the sister company:
- The sister company publishes 10 articles every day.
- February also has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the number of articles published by both websites to get the total number of articles published in February:

Therefore, the total number of articles published by the two websites together in February is:
\[ 840 \]"
"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since she is 4 years older than Steve, and Steve is 60 years old, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Steve's son is. The problem states that Steve's son is currently half as old as his mom. So, we calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's age} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out how old Steve's son's wife is. The problem states that she is 3 years younger than her husband. So, we calculate her age as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since one bag contains 16 kilograms, three bags will contain:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time Alisa biked: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time Stanley biked: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil to dig / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay to dig / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time to dig through soil and the time to dig through clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

   27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes**: Recently, she received 20000 more new likes.

4. **Total Likes**: To find the total number of likes, we add the likes after 3 weeks to the additional likes:

   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is **160000**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$20 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ \$400 - \$2 = \$398 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$30 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$600 \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 10\% \times \$600 = 0.10 \times \$600 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ \$600 - \$60 = \$540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ \$540 - \$398 = \$142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \$142 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, in the first month, Ariadne made a total of:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour also costs $30.

Now, let's add up the cost for the 3 hours:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

So, James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. This means she received an additional $420 - $200 = $220.

If her weekly wage should be $300, but she only received $220, then the difference between what she should have received and what she actually received is the amount that was withheld.

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$80"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

2. **Calculate the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane. The plane cost $150,000.

Next, we need to calculate the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel.

The cost to rent a hanger is $5000 per month.

The cost for fuel is twice the cost of the hanger, so:
\[ 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the total maintenance cost for the first year:
\[ 150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes (pork) + 30 minutes (rice) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$5 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$5 \]

So, the total cost of the first mixture is:
\[ \$5 + \$5 = \$10 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \text{ pound} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$2 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$5 \]

So, the total cost of the second mixture is:

Therefore, the first mixture costs \$3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
- The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)
- The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the heads equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the legs equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"First, let's find out the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \times 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the money that each person has to find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they share the money equally, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"First, we calculate the total time for the regular quarters. Since there are 4 quarters and each quarter is 12 minutes long, we multiply 4 by 12:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 5 minutes that were added due to the tie in the last quarter:

\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many employees are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, for 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

So, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"First, let's find out the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds.

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, they want to share this candy equally among the three of them.

To find out how much candy each person will have, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people:

12 pounds ÷ 3 people = 4 pounds per person

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A:
\[ 7 \text{ candies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per candy} = \$3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.75 \text{ per candy} = \$7.5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the candies:
\[ \$3.5 + \$7.5 = \$11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ \$15 - \$11 = \$4 \]

So, the change Adam received is:
\[ \$4 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- Her first 8 days were good.
- Her next 8 days were bad.
- Her following 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's confirm the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
- Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10

Now, let's see how the mood distribution fits with the given sequence:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 8 days: 8 bad days
- Following 8 days: 8 neutral days
- Next 3 days: 2 good days and 1 neutral day

So, the breakdown of good days is:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 3 days: 2 good days
- Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is:
- Total good days - Good days already counted
- 12 - 10 = 2

Final answer:
2"
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that Janey has 21 books.
2. The problem states that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. We can write this as an equation. If we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey's books can be represented as \( 2S + 3 \).
3. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: \( 2S + 3 = 21 \).
4. To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \).

First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final numerical answer:
Sally has 9 books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has enough toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so there are \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has enough toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

Now, let's sum up the total number of toys James needed to buy:

- First, he bought 8 toys.
- Then, he bought 12 more toys.

So, the total number of toys James needed to buy is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount, which is $1200.

Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \) dollars.

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:
\( 1200 - 480 = 720 \) dollars.

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \) dollars.

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount for Skyler is:
\( 720 - 480 = 240 \) dollars.

So, Skyler's investment is \( 240 \) dollars.

"First, let's find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer have together so far:

Carol has 20 signatures.
Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Together, they have:
20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in those 6 hours, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the information given.

1. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.
2. We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, we can calculate how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. So, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight (assuming Jack is also an adult):
\[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator can support a maximum load of 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write the equation for Max's cookies as:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can write the equation for the Cookie Monster's cookies as:

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 61 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can write the equation for Summer's cookies as:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 96 \]

Finally, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode and then calculate the total time based on his experiment.

1. **Determine the time to mow the entire lawn in each mode:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode.
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

2. **Calculate the time to mow half the lawn in each mode:**
   - Half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.
   - Half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Add the times together to find the total time:**
   - Total time = Time in ""turtle"" mode + Time in ""rabbit"" mode

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Catherine buys:

1. **Apples**: 
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4.

2. **Bananas**: 
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2 per kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges**: 
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3 per kilo = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies.

Next, we add the number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda to find the total number of cookies. So, \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies in total.

Now, if Greta and Celinda eat 10 of the cookies, we subtract those from the total. So, \(90 - 10 = 80\) cookies are left.

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is \(80\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin is \( T + 7 \).

There is one set of twins, so the other twin is also \( T + 7 \). There are also two other triplets, each of age \( T \).

The combined ages of all four individuals (one twin, the other twin, and the two triplets) is given as 44. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (T + 7) + (T + 7) + T + T = 44 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 2T + 7 + 2T = 44 \]
\[ 4T + 7 = 44 \]

Next, we solve for \( T \):
\[ 4T + 7 - 7 = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 4T = 37 \]
\[ T = \frac{37}{4} \]
\[ T = 9.25 \]

So, the age of one of the triplets is 9.25 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:
\[ T + 7 = 9.25 + 7 = 16.25 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{16.25}\)."

"First, let's find out the cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

This means each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we calculate \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) coins.

So, Neil saves \(20 + 8 = 28\) coins every month.

Next, we need to find out how many coins each of them saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

- Rong saves \(20 \times 12 = 240\) coins per year.
- Neil saves \(28 \times 12 = 336\) coins per year.

Now, we need to calculate how many coins they save in ten years:

- Rong saves \(240 \times 10 = 2400\) coins in ten years.
- Neil saves \(336 \times 10 = 3360\) coins in ten years.

Finally, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:

\(2400 + 3360 = 5760\)

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is 5760."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of an apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of a banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- For bananas: \(5 \text{ bananas} \times $1.0 = $5.0\).
- For apples: \(12 \text{ apples} \times $0.5 = $6.0\).
- For oranges: \(7 \text{ oranges} \times $3.0 = $21.0\).

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color Brittany's comforter has.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the same as the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"First, let's figure out how many regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs.

So, the number of regular chairs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of chairs currently available:
\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the number of chairs needed:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the points collected by the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren). So, the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies). So, the total number of great-grandbabies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend."
"First, let's find out how many pencils are actually in the box. If there is space for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, then:

20 (total space) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 (pencils in the box)

Now, to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we divide the number of pencils by 2 because a pair consists of 2 pencils:

16 (pencils in the box) ÷ 2 (pencils per pair) = 8 pairs

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

8 pairs"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:

\[ 15 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ fireworks/box} = 300 \text{ fireworks} \]

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks Hannah can see from her house, we calculate 40% of 300:

\[ 300 \text{ fireworks} \times 0.40 = 120 \text{ fireworks} \]

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:

\[ 3 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ fireworks/box} = 15 \text{ fireworks} \]

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks she sees from her house to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

\[ 120 \text{ fireworks} + 15 \text{ fireworks} = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of people going to the cinema. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person will take one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we need to calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks.

For drinks:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ drinks/person} = 40 \text{ drinks} \]
\[ 40 \text{ drinks} \times \$2/\text{drink} = \$80 \]

For snacks:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ snacks/person} = 60 \text{ snacks} \]
\[ 60 \text{ snacks} \times \$2/\text{snack} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the cost of drinks and snacks together:
\[ \$80 + \$120 = \$200 \]

So, the group has spent a total of \$200 on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's find out how much Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that when Gary's truck joins, the total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can find out how much Gary's truck can haul by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} - 4,000 \text{ pounds} - 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"First, let's figure out how many dumplings each group ate.

Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:
\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to divide the $100 in the ratio 3:2 between Gerald and Julia.

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

So, Gerald gets 3 parts, which is 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, let's find out how fast Martha's turtle can crawl. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet per second.

To find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the time:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine how much more money they need to reach their goal. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise in one hour. From the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is the initial 3 hours plus the additional 6 hours:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Final numerical answer:
9"
"First, let's find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.

To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by the city, we multiply 40% by 80%:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's total water, and 32% of that is used for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage is used for non-industrial purposes.

To find this, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final numerical answer:
8%"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily charge.

Step 1: Number of days in 2 weeks
Since there are 7 days in a week, in 2 weeks there are:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total charge
Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$168 \]

Therefore, Alex charges \(\$168\) for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To find out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum up the total production.

First, let's calculate the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's calculate the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to find out how much of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts of ice cream = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins) = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the deal**: For every 2 scoops of ice cream Erin buys, she gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

2. **Calculate the cost for 3 scoops**:
   - Cost of 2 scoops = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
   - Since the 3rd scoop is free, the total cost for 3 scoops is $3.00.

3. **Determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy with $6.00**:
   - Erin has $6.00.
   - Cost for 3 scoops = $3.00.
   - Number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy = $6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

4. **Calculate the total number of scoops**:
   - Each set of 3 scoops includes 3 scoops.
   - Total number of scoops = 2 sets * 3 scoops per set = 6 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which means she should buy 2 * 2 = 4 scoops to maximize the free scoops.

**Final Answer**: Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream."
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), she will eat:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Ginger will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces a day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), she will eat:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"First, we need to find out how much area Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

To find two thirds of 36 square feet, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. James paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking and then $1.5 per pound for the blueberries he picked. Since he picked 30 pounds, the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee, the total cost for picking the blueberries is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we subtract the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"First, let's find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the increase, we calculate 10% of $700:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wants to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ 385000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories.

\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.

\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories.

\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet.

\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

The total number of calories in the omelet is 770."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of 6 pencils is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of 8 erasers is:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

If you paid $10, the change you would get is:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"First, let's find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 30 people receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews get a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of these 6 people accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept it, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, 2 people accept the position.

**Final Answer: 2**"
"First, let's find out how many sacks of rice Goldy gave away in total. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, the total number of sacks given away is:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ sacks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice this is. Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight per sack:

\[ 7 \text{ sacks} \times 25 \text{ kg/sack} = 175 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 175 \text{ kg} \]"
"This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, the total number of boxes she bought this week is:

3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes with her feet when her arms are not raised. She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute with her arms not raised is:

\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms not raised, the total number of taps in those 3 minutes is:

\[ 550 \times 3 = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised. With her arms raised, her tap rate is 200 taps per minute for each foot, so the total number of taps per minute is:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total number of taps in those 2 minutes is:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both periods to get the total number of taps in 5 minutes:

\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then compare the two.

1. **Cost if the city fixes it:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - The city council will not charge Ron for this if they fix it.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes it himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron will also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.

Let's calculate the total cost for Ron fixing it himself:
- Cost of asphalt: \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- Fine: $120.
- Total cost for Ron: \(75 + 120 = 195\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two scenarios:
- Cost if the city fixes it: $450 (damage to the car).
- Cost if Ron fixes it himself: $195.

To find out how much Ron saves by fixing it himself:
- Savings: \(450 - 195 = 255\) dollars.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining normal chairs.
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- So, the remaining normal chairs are \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the remaining baby chairs.
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- So, the remaining baby chairs are \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Step 3: Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together.
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

Therefore, the restaurant has \(\boxed{160}\) chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three people ate a total of:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two people ate a total of:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, we calculate the dog's time as follows:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we add the times together and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, Topher's shoe is \(96 + 4 = 100\) inches long.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \(x\) inches. The relationship can be written as:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \(x\), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of students' cars smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16
\]

Each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:

\[
16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of teachers' cars smashed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24
\]

Each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:

\[
24 \times 2 = 48
\]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for the students' cars and the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:

\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

\[
\boxed{112}

"First, let's find the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**: 
   - 2/5 of 5000 people voted.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \) people voted.

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Total people - people who voted = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people voted.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \) people voted.

5. **Remaining people who did not vote by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people after midday - people who voted by 16:00 = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is **1000**."

2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the number of pieces per pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum needed.
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Step 2: Determine how many packs of gum are needed.
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.

Adding these together, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[
\frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

Since 3 sleeves are needed and there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we need to find out Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it.

Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

The total amount of money is $20.

Now, we divide $20 by 4:

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

So, each person gets $5.

Each of them got $5."
"First, let's calculate the weight of each book:

- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

\[2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many votes candidate A got. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We can find out how many votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each has after this exchange.

For Boris:
\[ \text{Boris's new apple count} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

For Beck:
\[ \text{Beck's new apple count} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange. We do this by subtracting Beck's new apple count from Boris's new apple count:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's new apple count} - \text{Beck's new apple count} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube.

For the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- So, the total water used for giant cubes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

For the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- So, the total water used for medium cubes is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

For the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- So, the total water used for small cubes is \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for medium cubes + water for small cubes
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After making the cubes, the amount of water left is:
- Water left = initial water - total water used
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

So, the final answer is:
2 ounces"
"First, let's find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Clara's books} = 2 \times \text{Steven's books} \]

Given Clara's books = 20, we can solve for Steven's books:

\[ 20 = 2 \times \text{Steven's books} \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"First, let's find out the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. We know the total number of students in the class is 50. We also know that 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated by subtracting the number of students who like the other activities from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away 1/3 of them. 

First, calculate 1/3 of 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. Now, subtract the scared birds from the initial number:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the 8 that remained. Add these 20 birds to the 8 that were left:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

So, the final number of birds in the backyard is:
28"
"First, let's find out how many students are in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same amount of students, we divide 80 by 2:

80 ÷ 2 = 40

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find 40% of 40, we multiply 40 by 40% (or 0.40):

40 × 0.40 = 16

This means there are 16 girls in each class.

To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

40 - 16 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the total number of slices now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so the final number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8

"First, let's find out the total number of grooming jobs Melissa has this week.

- Dogs to be bathed: 8
- Cats to be nails clipped: 5
- Birds to be wings trimmed: 3
- Horses to be brushed: 12

Now, we add these numbers together to get the total number of grooming jobs:

\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa will be working for 7 days in a week. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of grooming jobs by the number of days in a week:

\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the value of these two cards is:

\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

There are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. So, the total value of these 30 cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $26 per adult
- Cost for children: $12 per child

Total cost for adults = 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
Total cost for children = 2 children * $12/child = $24

Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $14 per adult
- Cost for children: $10 per child

Total cost for adults = 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
Total cost for children = 2 children * $10/child = $20

Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

Savings = Total cost for the first amusement park - Total cost for the second amusement park
Savings = $76 - $48 = $28

So, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"First, let's calculate how much the vendor used to spend on tomatoes per day.

The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each and sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the daily cost was:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.50/\text{tomato} = \$250 \]

Now, with the new vendor, the cost per tomato is $0.40. So, the new daily cost is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.40/\text{tomato} = \$200 \]

The daily savings by switching vendors is:
\[ \$250 - \$200 = \$50 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings are:
\[ \$50 \times 7 = \$350 \]

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = Sean's marbles × 2
Cal's marbles = 56 × 2
Cal's marbles = 112

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.

Carl's marbles = Sean's marbles × 4
Carl's marbles = 56 × 4
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined."
"First, we need to determine how many students will be in each of the six groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

54 students ÷ 6 groups = 9 students per group

Next, we need to find out how many groups are required if each group must have 9 students and we need 12 groups in total. Since we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups:

12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups

So, the final numerical answer is:

6 more groups are needed."
"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then add them up.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekday:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekend:**
   - There are 2 days in a weekend.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekends is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one week is the sum of the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends.
   - So, in one week, the total number of chairs rented is \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

4. **Calculate the number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - There are 8 weeks in two 4-week months.
   - So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(8 \times 500 = 4000\) chairs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther was left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:

"First, let's find out how much each roommate pays per month for electricity. Since the total monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we divide the total bill by the number of roommates:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

So, each roommate pays $25 per month for electricity.

Next, to find out how much each roommate pays per year, we need to multiply the monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 plates

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts:

- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now."
"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 0.90 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 0.50 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

3. **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them.
   - She has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Small buttons from converting remaining large stickers to small buttons: 60
- Large buttons: 20 (which can be converted to small buttons, but we count them as large buttons for now)

Total buttons (including large buttons):
\[ 27 \text{ (small)} + 60 \text{ (small)} + 60 \text{ (small)} + 20 \text{ (large)} = 167 \]

So, by the end, Lorraine has a total of 167 buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's use some simple algebra. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \). Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x \) with 11:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18

"First, let's find out how many songs John has in total across his 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we can calculate the total number of songs by multiplying the number of songs in one playlist by the number of playlists:

\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. To find out the total number of hours the songs will last, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win.

**Final Answer: 16**"
"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**
   - We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

2. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Since there are 18 Pomeranians, and they make up two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18
     \]
   - To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total:
     \[
     \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
     \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave him half of it. So, we calculate half of $90:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we add the $45 that Ava gave to Jayden to the $70 Jayden already had:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount of money he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house be \( x \).
2. The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of what the first house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house will need double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:

\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = 250 \]
\[ \frac{2x + x + 4x}{2} = 250 \]
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

Next, solve for \( x \):

\[ 7x = 500 \]
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \]
\[ x = 71.42857142857143 \]

Since the third house needs double the first house, the number of cases for the third house is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 71.42857142857143 \]
\[ 2x = 142.85714285714286 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the third house will need 143 cases of shingles.

"First, let's find out how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has.

George has 200 bananas. So, 45% of 200 is calculated as:
\[ 45\% \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

This means George has 90 more pears than the number of bananas he has. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"First, we need to find out how much money Marissa had left after buying the ball. She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball.

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing the number of books Ezra read by 2:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, to find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

So, they have read altogether:
\[ 600 \] books."
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for every hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, so her total for Monday is \( 75 + 5 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for every hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, let's add her earnings from both days:

- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

So, her total earnings for these two days are \( 80 + 30 = 110 \) dollars.

**Final Answer: 110**"
"First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold. Since they sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, we multiply 5 by 4:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold. Since they sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, we multiply 2 by 8:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, the total money from eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the money he already made from the total goal:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell to make the remaining $75. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \(\boxed{3}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total remaining time:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:
\[ 25\% \]"

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept \(\boxed{10}\) pencils."
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to the Museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time Back from the Museum:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles.
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time Spent at the Museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to the museum: 2 hours

- Time spent at the museum: 6 hours

Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- So, the total number of wheels for cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- So, the total number of wheels for motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, let's find the total number of wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles:
- Total wheels needed = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles
- Total wheels needed = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available:
- Wheels left = wheels available - wheels needed
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: 10 points per enemy.
- Points for berries: 5 points per berry.
- Points for time: 30 points per second.

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

**Emma's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E_e \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times E_b \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times E_t \)

So, Emma's total score is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

**Ava's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times A_e = 10 \times (E_e + 8) = 10E_e + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times A_b = 5 \times (E_b + 3) = 5E_b + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times A_t = 30 \times (E_t + 4) = 30E_t + 120 \)

So, Ava's total score is:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:

"First, let's find out the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost 30 dollars. 

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find out how much the remaining two pizzas cost in total, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas we already know from the total cost.

\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars} \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
2 dollars"
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in those 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount. So, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
For 2 days, the number of rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days gives the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Purchased:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the 17 new fish, the total number of fish in the pond is \(7 + 17 = 24\).

4. **Relationship Between Orange and White Fish:**
   - After adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \(O\) as the number of orange fish after the purchase.
- \(W\) as the number of white fish after the purchase.

From the problem, we know:
\[ O = 2W \]

We also know the total number of fish:
\[ O + W = 24 \]

Substituting \(O = 2W\) into the total fish equation:
\[ 2W + W = 24 \]
\[ 3W = 24 \]
\[ W = 8 \]

So, Bob has 8 white fish after the purchase.

5. **Initial White Fish:**
   - Initially, Bob had 4 white fish.

6. **White Fish Purchased:**
   - The number of white fish Bob bought is:
   \[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week. Since he travels 5 miles one way, the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week.

Total weekly distance = 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

Gallons of gas used per week = Total weekly distance / Fuel efficiency
Gallons of gas used per week = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Now, we know the price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. So, we can calculate the total cost of gas Andy uses per week.

Cost of gas per week = Gallons of gas used per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on gas."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Carrie spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{School contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise. We know John has $50, and the total cost is $300. The school will contribute $150. So, the total amount John needs to cover is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

Since John already has $50, the amount he still needs to raise is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John is still missing is:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of new employees hired in three months.
2. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Find the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of new employees hired in three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 \text{ employees} + 60 \text{ employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Find the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount paid over three months is:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to add up the total time for singing both songs.

First, let's calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"". Since they plan to sing it twice and each time it takes 150 seconds, we multiply 150 seconds by 2:

\[ 150 \, \text{seconds} \times 2 = 300 \, \text{seconds} \]

Next, we add the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"", which is 240 seconds:

\[ 300 \, \text{seconds} + 240 \, \text{seconds} = 540 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds.

540 seconds"
"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different times:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is raised by $0.50:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is raised by $1.00:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work:
- Billy's earnings = $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.

Next, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
- Sally's starting hourly wage = Billy's starting hourly wage + $0.50 = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work:
- Sally's earnings = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread. Each loaf costs $2, so:
\[ 3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2/\text{loaf} = \$6 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels. Each bagel costs $1, so:
\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1/\text{bagel} = \$2 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
\[ \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of Pierson's points would be:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount, so:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their points together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes, and each class has 25 students. So, the total number of students is:

\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is:

\[ 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:

\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:

\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted:

\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted:

\[ 1240 \text{ trees} \]"
"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. Since she plays for half an hour every day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[ \text{Hours in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours she plays in the following week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[ \text{Hours in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours she has played so far:

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

**Final Answer:**
20 miles"
"First, let's find the total cost of the materials before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, James pays a 30% premium on this total cost. To find the premium, we calculate 30% of $900:

\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find out how much James paid in total:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
- 340 out of 500 passed.
- Pass rate = \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.

For fourth graders:
- 40 out of 100 passed.
- Pass rate = \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.

For fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
- Pass rate = \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.

Total number of students:
- Third graders: 500
- Fourth graders: 100
- Fifth graders: 400
- Total = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Total number of students who passed:
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \)
- Total = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
- Overall pass rate = \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply 72 by 2:

\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \div 12 = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we need to divide the total square inches by the height in inches:

\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students and the sixteen students.

Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts, so the total amount of tea they drank is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts, so the total amount of tea they drank is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

First, let's find the total number of candies Dale has:
\[ 100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold:
\[ 200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies} \]

So, Dale still needs to sell \(\boxed{50}\) candies to sell all of his candy."
"Let's break down the problem month by month, starting from the beginning of the year.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** There are 10 students.
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so there are \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students.
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students.
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students.
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students.
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
- Number of students at the end of May: 320

The additional students that joined by the end of May are:
\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find out the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, on average, Felix climbed \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. She picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. She picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. She picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of petals she initially had:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower she picked. So, she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Now, we subtract the petals that were dropped from the initial total:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used to make the S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used to make the S'mores from the total number of marshmallows left:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \]

The remaining 14 marshmallows are the ones left to make more S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's break down the time each person can play:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
3. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many games each person can play in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):

- Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) games
- Each of the two friends: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) games
- The better friend: \(240 \div 30 = 8\) games

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:

- Jack uses \(12 \times 1 = 12\) quarters.
- Each of the two friends uses \(24 \times 1 = 24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
- The better friend uses \(8 \times 1 = 8\) quarters.

Adding these up, the total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
68 quarters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the amount of citrus zest used is \( z \) ounces.
2. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
3. The amount of salt is \( s \) ounces.
4. The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so it is also \( s \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it is \( 2s \) ounces.

Now, we know the total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We need to find the value of \( s \) and then use it to find the value of \( 2s \) (the amount of oil).

From the equation \( 2z + 4s = 10 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ 2z = 10 - 4s \]
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and \( z \) must be a non-negative value, we can test some values for \( s \). Let's try \( s = 1 \):
\[ z = 5 - 2(1) = 3 \]
This is a valid value. So, if \( s = 1 \), then the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2(1) = 2 \]

To confirm, let's check the total:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 \]
This is correct. Therefore, the amount of oil used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- So, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- So, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

First, we add the cupcakes he already has:
8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy:
63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15 cupcakes

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with:

\[ \boxed{16} \text{ cars} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students equally among the 20 students. So, we divide $125,000 by 20:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time Sandy walked over the two days in hours, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

Total number of cars he counted during lunch break:
35"
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Since each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20, we can find the total pay for one cycle by multiplying the number of tasks by the pay per task:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} \]

Next, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, we multiply the pay per cycle by the number of cycles per day:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles per day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day} \]

Finally, to find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

\[ \$180.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. So, Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, to find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game:

- Points in the first game: 14
- Points in the second game: 4

Total points = \(14 + 4 = 18\)

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's start by defining the number of cards PJ has as \( x \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have.

Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total cost of the book and the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 32 + 3.00 = 35.00 \]
\[ \text{Money lost} = 35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \]

Milly will lose $11.00."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Then, she buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the money she had initially:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

First week: 8,000 bars

Second week: Half of the first week, so \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars

Third week: Three times the first week, so \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production.

Total production of the first three weeks: \( 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \) bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

So, the production for the fourth week is \( 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \) bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then find out the total time spent in a month.

1. **Time spent writing songs per week:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

2. **Time spent on makeup per week:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.

3. **Time spent recording videos per week:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.

4. **Total time spent on TikTok activities per week:**
   - Total time = Time spent writing songs + Time spent on makeup + Time spent recording videos
   - Total time = 120 minutes + 90 minutes + 72 minutes = 282 minutes.

5. **Total time spent on TikTok activities in a month:**
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is:
   \[2 \times \$15.00 = \$30.00\]

3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is:
   \[1 \times \$15.00 = \$15.00\]

4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is:
   \[10 \times \$15.00 = \$150.00\]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \$129.00 + \$30.00 + \$15.00 + \$150.00 = \$224.00 \]

So, the total cost for Angela will be:
\[ \$224.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - \( 480 \) inches ÷ \( 12 \) inches/foot = \( 40 \) feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

First, he travels for 4 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the time it takes for one kangaroo to do the same by dividing 18 hours by 3. This gives us:

\[ \text{Time for one kangaroo} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

This means it takes one kangaroo 6 hours to travel across the highway.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel the same distance. Since the speed of the turtles is half that of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. Therefore, the time for one turtle to travel across the highway is:

\[ \text{Time for one turtle} = 6 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since the speed of the turtles is the same regardless of the number of turtles, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is still 12 hours.

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's find out how many clay dishes Rory made. Since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, and Kora made 20 dishes, Rory made:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many clay dishes Jada made. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, we add up all the clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:

\[ 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \]

So, together they made 140 clay dishes."
"First, let's calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in:

Original price of the laptop: $600
Trade-in discount: $200

Reduced price = $600 - $200 = $400

Now, let's add up all the money Erika has:

Money from her part-time job: $150
Money from her mom: $80
Extra money she needs: $50

Total money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse, is:

$150 + $80 + $50 = $280

Since the reduced price of the laptop is $400 and she has $280, the amount of money she has in her purse is:

$400 (reduced price) - $280 (total money she has) = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices he ate from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices eaten} = 15 \text{ slices left} \]

So, the final number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows.

Each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day. So, for 3 cows, the total milk produced is:
\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:
2"
"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these amounts.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10\) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) millimeters

Now, we add the lengths of the unused glue from all three glue sticks:
\[10 + 4 + 6 = 20\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills. To find out how much money she gave in total, we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

The hat cost $70. To find out how much change Thea received, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money she gave:

\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

So, Thea received $10 in change."
"First, let's calculate how much money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \) (Jack has 30 socks).
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the total number of students who are not good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
20 (total students) - 13 (students not good at both) = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (including those who are good at both math and English), we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

So, the final numerical answer is:
12 students are good at math."
"First, let's calculate the total time each group needs to perform, including the time to get on stage and exit the stage. Each group needs:

- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is left for the groups to perform:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original amount.

The simple interest formula is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, let's find the rate in decimal form. Three-quarters of the original amount is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

So, the rate (R) is 0.75 per year.

Now, we can calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]

Let's do the multiplication step by step:
\[ 300 \times 0.75 = 225 \]
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

So, the interest earned over 3 years is $675.

To find the total amount after 3 years, we add the interest to the original principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars. So, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- This means the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
- The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:
\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 (initial goats) - 10 (sold goats) = 45 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 (initial goats) - 20 (sold goats) = 25 goats.

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (goats left in Farm X) + 25 (goats left in Farm Y) = 70 goats.

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pairs.

2. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   - James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
   - To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs.
   - So, the average cost per pair is \(\frac{2640}{24}\).

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \(\frac{2640}{24} = 110\).

Therefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food baskets. Each basket of green food costs $25, and you are buying 3 of them. So, the total cost for the green food is:

\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food baskets. Each basket of red food costs $18, and you are getting $2 off for each basket of red food. So, the cost for each basket of red food after the discount is:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the red food to find the overall total cost:

\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

\[ \boxed{123} \]"
"First, let's find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half would be:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time for 45 rooms would be:

\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

15 hours"
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they will build \(12 \times 3 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built will be \(12 + 36 = 48\).

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year. So, they will build \(48 \times 2 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years will be \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the sum of all ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total.

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."

- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Infected people at the start of Day 2: 70
- Each of these 70 people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Infected people at the start of Day 3: 490
- Each of these 490 people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

So, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total amount by multiplying the number of customers by the tip amount:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

So, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\) oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

**3**"
"First, let's figure out how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, in a year, Wendy will earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige spent baking from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours.

Next, we find out how many banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 loaves every hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \$40.00 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = 70 - 30 = 40

Now, to find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40 = 110

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. Since there are 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos consumed is:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2
Number of green cars = 10

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. Since there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, we can calculate the number of blue cars as follows:

Number of blue cars = 3 × Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 × 10
Number of blue cars = 30

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find out how many yellow cars there are by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52
Number of yellow cars = 23

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's use some simple math to solve this problem.

First, let's say the number of books Fawn has is \( F \).

According to the problem, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. So, Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.

Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. So, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that together they have 85 books. So, we can write the equation:

\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."
"First, let's find out how much the sweet potatoes weigh. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, let's figure out how many jello cups Greg needs. If there are 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, then:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Since 1 box makes 10 cups, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25, so:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\$15.00\) on jello."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The electronics seller gives the seller $4000. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's find out how much Madeline pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 cost, we calculate:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining amount:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):

\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total to find out how many pieces were left.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, we subtract these from the remaining pieces.

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces he ate over the three days.

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far."
"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle of soda.

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle of water.

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

\[ \text{Total cost for soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the total cost for soda and the total cost for water to find the overall cost.

\[ \text{Overall cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03.

Total cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 × $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has to find out how much he has left.

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. She earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. So, we divide $33 by 3 hours to find her hourly rate.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours. We multiply her hourly rate by 12 hours.

\[ \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles.

Paul originally had 52 marbles. After receiving 28 more, he has:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate 1/4 of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ marbles} \]

Now, we subtract the lost marbles from the total he had after receiving more:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ marbles} \]

So, Paul has \(\boxed{60}\) marbles left."
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from the multiple-choice questions. Since there are 10 multiple-choice questions and she answers 80% of them correctly, the number of correct answers is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \]
Each correct multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so the points from multiple-choice questions are:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

Next, let's calculate the points Amy scores from the true/false questions. Since there are 20 true/false questions and she answers 90% of them correctly, the number of correct answers is:
\[ 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \]
Each correct true/false question is worth 1 point, so the points from true/false questions are:
\[ 18 \times 1 = 18 \]

Finally, let's calculate the points Amy scores from the long-answer questions. Since there are 5 long-answer questions and she answers 60% of them correctly, the number of correct answers is:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]
Each correct long-answer question is worth 5 points, so the points from long-answer questions are:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, we add up all the points from the different types of questions:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each to make a profit of $2000. The total revenue from selling these chickens is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens he took to the market must be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000."
"First, let's find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sold was 32, we subtract Julie's sales from the total:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, so we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many each of them sold:

18 ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

Micah sold 9 glasses. Julie sold 14 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

5"
"First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter. So, the total money she will get from selling the rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters.

The cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the original rope to find out how much money she will have left over:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first find Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). So, in \( x \) years, her age will be:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

16"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the usual length of Elaina's concert is \( x \) minutes.
2. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, so the length of the final concert before the encore is \( 2x \) minutes.
3. She also performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the final concert.
4. The total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is given as 65 minutes.

So, we can write the equation for the total runtime of the final concert as:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 50 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concert is 25 minutes.

Final answer:
25"
"Argo initially has 200 toys.

- He gives 40 toys to Alyssa: \(200 - 40 = 160\)
- Then, he gives 80 toys to Bonnie: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Finally, he gives 30 toys to Nicky: \(80 - 30 = 50\)

So, Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't find any space to fit in. Since 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in.

This means that the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the number of microphones that can be paired by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20 pairs"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply 3 by 8:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 birds feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[
34

"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. So, the number of cookies left is:

55 - 5 = 50 cookies

These 50 cookies were placed equally into five jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the number of cookies by the number of jars:

50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find out how many flowering plants there are, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is 25%."
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the salad**: The salad costs $6.
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. **Total cost of the salad and yogurt**: $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.
4. **Total daily cost**: Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods every day.
5. **Cost of the carrots**: To find the cost of the carrots, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total daily cost. So, $11 (total) - $9 (salad and yogurt) = $2.
6. **Cost of one carrot**: Ellen eats two carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and got a raise of $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns over the two weeks and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

**First Week:**
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so for mowing Joe's lawn once, she gets \( \frac{6}{J} \) dollars.

**Second Week:**
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
- Again, Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so for mowing Joe's lawn once, she gets \( \frac{6}{J} \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns over the two weeks.

**First Week Earnings:**
- Earnings from Joe's lawn: \( J \times \frac{6}{J} = 6 \) dollars.
- Earnings from Kamala's lawn: \( 3J \times \frac{6}{J} = 18 \) dollars.
- Total for the first week: \( 6 + 18 = 24 \) dollars.

**Second Week Earnings:**
- Earnings from Joe's lawn: \( J \times \frac{6}{J} = 6 \) dollars.
- Earnings from Alba's lawn: \( 5J \times \frac{6}{J} = 30 \) dollars.
- Total for the second week: \( 6 + 30 = 36 \) dollars.

**Total Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
- Total for both weeks: \( 24 + 36 = 60 \) dollars.

**Total Earnings:**
- Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

**Earnings from Lemonade Sales:**
- Subtract the total earnings from mowing lawns from the total earnings: \( 80 - 60 = 20 \) dollars.

So, Tasha made \(\boxed{20}\) dollars from lemonade sales."
"First, let's find out Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, the total hours he rents his car out each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets paid $25 an hour. Therefore, his total earnings from renting his car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500. So, his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car each month is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she must have originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

1"
"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles.

To find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 50 miles:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ 110 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies.

Total cookies made: 100
Cookies taken by husband: 4

Cookies left: 100 - 4 = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew: 96 ÷ 6 = 16

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read by Denise today:**
   - Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday.
   - Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

3. **Pages read by Daniel today:**
   - Daniel did not read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.

4. **Total pages read by each:**
   - Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
   - Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's understand the capacity of the pot in terms of bowls. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, that's 2 adult bowls used. 

So, the pot has enough for:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife)
- Or, 8 child bowls

This means after Calvin and his wife have their soup, the pot will have enough for 8 child bowls. Since there are 2 children, and each child will have one bowl, the children will have:
- 2 bowls for the children

Now, we need to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since the pot has enough for 8 child bowls and the children will have 2 bowls for dinner, the leftover will be:
- 8 - 2 = 6 bowls

These 6 bowls are for lunch. Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover bowls by the number of children:
- 6 bowls / 2 children = 3 times

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

First, calculate the cost of the notebooks:
5 notebooks × $1.50/notebook = $7.50

Next, add the cost of the ballpen:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

So, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can find out how much material is needed for one small mask by dividing 2 yards by 4:
\[ \text{Material for one small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by 20:
\[ \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we can find out how much material is needed for one large mask by dividing 2.25 yards by 3:
\[ \text{Material for one large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one large mask by 8:
\[ \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, to find out the total material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
\[ \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money she spent by the total number of times she saw the movies.

First, let's calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, we multiply 9 by 3:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Deepa saw the movies 27 times in total.

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money by the total number of times she saw the movies:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"First, let's figure out how much time Harold spends on each activity:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on these activities is \(10 + 8 + 1 = 19\) hours.

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's figure out how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 (original blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used for fishing) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's calculate how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his 9 red shoe boxes:
1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3 red shoe boxes used.

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 (original red shoe boxes) - 3 (used for fishing) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes are left in Tim's box."
"First, we need to find out how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate the number of books Joseph originally had as follows:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. However, Joseph lost 2 of them. To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we subtract the 2 books he lost from the original number of books he had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie. 

To find 1/5 of 30, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving some to Jamie and Donald.

Dean originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 6 to Jamie and 10 to Donald, the number of marbles left for Dean is:
\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let's say Duncan's current age is \( D \) and Adam's current age is \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
3. Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
4. The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
5. We know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D \) with 60 in the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
8. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
9. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   30 + 8 = 38
   \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add the sizes of both farms together to find the total number of acres:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's figure out how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we know that Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. To find out how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64 \]

So, Colby earns \(\$64\) in a typical eight-hour workday."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we can calculate the time for an extreme sudoku as follows:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes (since 30 minutes is half an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces for the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:
     \[
     58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna. To find the number of yellow balloons, divide the number of bologna pieces for yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:
     \[
     \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
     \]

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we first need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. In a 30-day month, he would drive:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then determine the initial amount each had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can find the cost for 12 balloons by calculating:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 12 balloons} = \left(\frac{12}{2}\right) \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: 2 tubs of ice cream cost $7 each, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each had:
\[
\text{Amount each had} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, and there are 6 students playing tennis, we can calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ (tennis players)} \times 2 = 12 \text{ (volleyball players)} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball:

\[ 6 \text{ (tennis players)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball players)} = 18 \text{ (students playing tennis or volleyball)} \]

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of soccer players is:

\[ 16 \text{ (boys)} + 22 \text{ (girls)} = 38 \text{ (soccer players)} \]

Finally, we add the number of students playing tennis or volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to get the total number of students:

\[ 18 \text{ (tennis or volleyball players)} + 38 \text{ (soccer players)} = 56 \text{ (total students)} \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money the class made from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue from selling the lollipops is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pets Larry has in total.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

The total number of pets is \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"First, let's figure out how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Now, let's add the number of slices Abby and Josh eat together in a day:
- Abby eats 2 slices.
- Josh eats 4 slices.
So, together they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in a day:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. To find out how many shells she collected, we need to calculate the number of years she collected shells and then multiply by the number of shells she collects each year.

From age 5 to age 10, she collected shells for:
10 - 5 = 5 years

Since she collects one shell each month, and there are 12 months in a year, she collects:
12 shells per year

So, over 5 years, she would have collected:
5 years * 12 shells/year = 60 shells

Final numerical answer:

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, we determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we divide 8 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks up in total. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in total.

3. To find the number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
   \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries."
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank, we get:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"

   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month. So, the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it's a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining money is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can see:
\[10 \div 10 = 1\] movie.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[1\] movie."
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Calories in a mini cinnamon roll: \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Calories in a mini blueberry muffin: \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40,000 calories.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45,000 calories.
   - Total calories from all pastries: \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

The total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is **85,000** calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add 39 and 78:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add 78 to the result:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add 48 to the result:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add 57 to the result:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday).

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
- It travels for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
- It travels for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find out how much farther the bus went:
- Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

60 miles"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

First, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's and Peter's ages:
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many water balloons Maria and her friends started with.

Maria invited 4 friends, so there are a total of 5 people (including Maria). Each of them got 2 water balloons at the start. So, the total number of water balloons they had at the start is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ balloons/person} = 10 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total number of balloons at the start is:
\[ 10 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 11 \text{ balloons} \]

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons given is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons/person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding these to the initial total, the final number of balloons is:
\[ 11 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 26 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- She has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

For Sydney:
- She has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's find the total distance spat by both of them combined:
- Total distance = Distance spat by Zoey + Distance spat by Sydney
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people:
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- In a month with 30 days, it runs \(24 \times 30 = 720\) hours.

So, the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month is:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 720 \text{ hours} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- In a month with 30 days, it runs \(24 \times 30 = 720\) hours.

So, the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month is:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 720 \text{ hours} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine how much Cameron would pay if he chooses the 12-hour stay option and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour.

1. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
2. The number of additional hours after the first 12 hours is \(17 - 12 = 5\) hours.
3. The cost for the additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay would be:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. We know that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. Since there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds, the total for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep and each needing 7 pounds, the total for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay Nate needs: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the amount he spent on gas:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that amount:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. Each pen costs $25:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \text{ pens} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number of letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. There are 5 different schools.

First, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To find out how much Patty's Plumbing charged for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is $35 per hour, or part thereof, we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$78.75
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
\$40 + \$78.75 + \$60 = \$178.75
\]

So, Patty's Plumbing charged \(\$178.75\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15/\text{CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 \times 0.60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40/\text{CD} = \$200 \]

However, since he only sold 5 out of the 10 CDs, the amount he actually spent on the CDs he kept is the discounted price of 10 CDs minus the money he got from selling 5 CDs. But since the question asks how much money he was out, we only need to consider the initial cost after the discount, which is $90, because the money from selling the CDs is not a cost but an income.

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carat = $5.

Now, we add the earnings from all the root crops together:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.

\[ \text{Distance swum} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information given.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate seven times that amount:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, we need to subtract 40 from this amount to find out how many loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

450"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers.

She loses 7 stickers, so:

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times.

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from selling the Wall Street Journal.

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley earns is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Marcus is. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. So, if we let Leo's age be \( L \), then:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{L}{2} \]

Since we know Marcus is 21 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{L}{2} \]

To find Leo's age, we solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

Leo is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to understand the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages.

Given:
- 100 pages are printed on 1 inch of paper.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

First, we calculate the number of pages per inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Pages per inch} \times \text{Thickness in inches} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \times 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes in 15 hours:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes Vince to staple 30 reports:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he staples in each interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim woke up earlier:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. but woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep that day:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Kim slept on her bed:**
   - Subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was asleep.
   - \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's find out how many measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. He has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of unoccupied beds initially:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

Now, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will be the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of new patients admitted:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ occupied beds} \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 emails are to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. Since 9 emails are non-work and 6 of those are to family, the remaining emails are:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 times Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 times Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to understand that Courtney's count of 48 was 20% more than the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to the problem, Courtney's count (48) is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% is the actual number and 20% is the overstatement). This can be written as:
\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

1. Let's say Jeffrey carried \( J \) balls.
2. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

According to the problem, if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, we can set up the equation for Jason's balls as \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):

\[ 2J = 2 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

To find the total number of balls, we add the number of balls each boy carried:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Net increase on the third day: 6

So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so four times that is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

This means that on the fourth day, the pirates dug enough holes to increase the total from 29 to 40. Therefore, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than either of them, Collins got:

\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \text{ corn chips} \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add up the corn chips each person got:

\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:

225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"First, we need to find out how much the tickets for travel cost. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. 

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, to find the total cost of travel, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.
4. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
   \]
   \[
   9A - 21 = 339
   \]
6. Add 21 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 9:
   \[
   A = 40
   \]
8. Now, we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. To find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught, we use the expression for Stan's Pokemon:
   \[
   4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
   \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"First, let's figure out how many episodes there are in total. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we divide the minutes per episode by 2 to find the number of episodes:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ episodes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we add the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. So, she received 6 brownies (since 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies).
3. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. So, she received 48 brownies (since 4 dozen = 48 brownies).
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. So, 18 brownies were eaten (since 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies).

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made: 12
- Brownies received from office party: 6
- Brownies received from home party: 48

Total brownies before the party: \(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\)

During the party, 18 brownies were eaten. So, the number of brownies left is:

\(66 - 18 = 48\)

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"First, let's find out the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, and Nani is 8 years old, we can calculate the brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Next, we need to find out the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of Nani's age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Since Nani's sister is 25% younger, we subtract this from Nani's age to find her age:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = \text{Nani's age} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."

   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

So, it will take Andy \(\boxed{227}\) minutes to string all the racquets."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The price of the first 2 phones is full price, so:
- 2 phones * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, so:
- 2 phones * $600 / 2 = 2 phones * $300 = $600

Now, we add the cost of the first 2 phones and the second 2 phones:
- $1200 + $600 = $1800

So, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"First, let's find out how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

So, Zeke's team has \(13 + 7 = 20\) players.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

So, the total number of players is \(20 + 13 = 33\).

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals:

\[2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}\]

Next, we subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes she bought:

\[12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}\]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and then sold some of. She kept 1/4 of these 8 boxes for herself. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}\]

So, the number of boxes she sold is:

\[8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}\]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges}\]

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of states in the USA is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India is \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This would be the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India.

So, the total number of states is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries. So, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's break down the sales for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, using the sales from Sunday, we can determine the sales for Saturday:
- Apple pie on Saturday: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day.

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
- Apple pie: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
- Total for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
- Apple pie: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
- Total for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: \(\$225 + \$315 = \$540\)

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of sunscreen used per day:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, she uses \(1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:**
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces}\).

3. **Determine how many bottles are needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: \(32 \, \text{ounces} \div 8 \, \text{ounces/bottle} = 4 \, \text{bottles}\).

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's find the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. So, 40% of $100 is:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

This means the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. So, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

So, the total cost of both cars is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24 be \(D\).
   - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will also be 5 years older.
   - Therefore, the current age of Emil's dad is \(48 - 5 = 43\).

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24 be \(B\).
   - Therefore, \(24 = 2 \times B\).
   - Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will also be 5 years younger.
   - Therefore, the current age of Emil's brother is \(12 - 5 = 7\).

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - The current age of Emil's dad is 43.
   - The current age of Emil's brother is 7.
   - Therefore, the sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her:
20 (from mother) + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her:
2 * 20 (from mother) = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's find out how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. So, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the total pounds of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we need to find out how many servings 21 pounds of crawfish make. We do this by dividing the total pounds by the number of pounds per serving:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the two sizes together and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet, we'll keep our calculations in feet.

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.

So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up:
\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket.

For each basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all the baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00.

\[ \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00 \text{ per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

**Final Answer: 6**"
"First, let's break down the tasks Emily needs to do:

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
     \[
     \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90:
     \[
     \frac{90}{30} = 3 \text{ sets}
     \]
   - Since each set takes 10 minutes, for 3 sets, it will take:
     \[
     3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and sauteing:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - So, the temperature dropped by \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - So, the temperature dropped by \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was off for 2 hours.
   - So, the temperature increased by \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Total Temperature Change:**
   - The total cooling effect is \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - The warming effect is \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - So, the net temperature change is \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Calculate the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then add them all together.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, so:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church, so:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (which is 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we add all these checks together:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

So, Buford writes **52 checks per year**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\).
   - Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's figure out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we can calculate the amount from his father as follows:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam's father gave him $12.

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam received a total of $18 from his mother and father.

The total cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

\[ \text{Adam had to contribute } \$12 \text{ from his savings.} \]"
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. So, the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- Helene is 10 years old.

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the group:

\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"First, let's find out how much money Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From his neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to include the $200 that Walter's friend is going to give:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as the total amount collected from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend. So, we need to multiply the total amount by 3:

\[ 2200 \times 3 = 6600 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:

\[ \boxed{6600} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first define the size of the slices. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

Now, we need to find out how many slices each group gets and the total number of slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \), so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours.
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Let's add up the total time required:

- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making batter: 20 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

Total time = 120 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:**
   - Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
   - Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
   - Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

2. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

3. **Calculate the number of chocolate bars in one box:**
   - Since 8 boxes contain 64 chocolate bars, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.
   - Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 ÷ 8 = 8.

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"First, let's calculate the cost per session for the dance studio. The cost includes a fixed cost of renting the studio and a variable cost based on the number of students.

The fixed cost per session is $25. The variable cost per session is $1.50 per student. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \$40 \text{ per day} = \$120 \]

Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$120 \text{ per week} = \$480 \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Since Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars per box.

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we'll do the same for Martha. Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter.

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

8"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. Since the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water are needed:

\[ \text{Gallons of water needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, they need 8260 gallons of water to fill the pool.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by Matteo:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time traveled: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by Shandy:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time traveled: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old and how many are under 16 years old.

Since half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old:
\[ \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

The remaining half are under 16 years old:
\[ \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of male students over 16 years old:
\[ \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \]

So, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
\[ \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

Now, we calculate the number of male students under 16 years old:
\[ \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

So, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
\[ \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

Finally, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of female students:
\[ \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[ 1875 \]"
"First, let's find out how many laps each person can run in one hour.

Bethany can run 10 laps.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"First, let's calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Total on the first day:**
\[
4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Total on the second day:**
\[
3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Total water pumped over two days:**
\[
7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before the Second Phase:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.93)^3 \):
     \[
     (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]

3. **Charge Before the First Phase:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 0.348, so:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.91)^5 \):
     \[
     (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **55.7%**."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in total per hour from wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

- Hours worked per week: 40

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, let's find out how much Janet wants to save for the down payment:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Percentage to save: 20%

Amount to save = 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, we calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000:

- Weekly savings: $1000/week
- Total savings needed: $2000

Number of weeks needed = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already bought.

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10. After buying the fruits, he has:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final answer:

"First, let's find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away:

15 packs (total) - 2 packs (kept) = 13 packs (given to friends)

Each pack contains 60 pieces of sweets, so the total number of pieces Anne gave to her friends is:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. So, each friend received:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase each year to the original price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120
   - Increase = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126
   - Increase = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30
   - Increase = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**
$139"
"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. This means there are a total of:

\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

albums dedicated to selfies and portraits. Since each of these 5 albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:

\[ 45 \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

The final answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests.
5. **Additional Checkins After Dinner**: 7 more people checked in after dinner.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- **Guests after early checkouts**: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- **Guests after late checkouts**: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- **Guests after afternoon checkins**: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- **Guests after additional checkins**: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is **98**."

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22\]

So, John has 22 bananas in total."
"First, let's break down the quiz into its different types of questions:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
- Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- These 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so:
  - Average questions: \(36 / 2 = 18\)
  - Difficult questions: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

Next, we calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
  - \(75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18\)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"First, let's figure out the price of a large stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4 and a large one costs three times that, a large stuffed animal costs:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so:

\[ S = 2L \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4S \) and from the large ones are \( 12L \). Therefore, the total earnings equation is:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we have:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:

\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she made from selling cupcakes. She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:

\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:

\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. So, the total amount given to her sisters is:

\[ 2 \text{ sisters} \times \$10/\text{sister} = \$20 \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:

\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:

\[ \$300 \]"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs.

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

This means the number of eggs left for their friends to find is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

"First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days.

1. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day.
2. So, 40 dwarves can mine \(36 \times 40 = 1440\) pounds per day.
3. In 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days."
"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Price per sandwich = $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Price per sandwich = $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of 8 sandwiches = 8 × $1.50 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, let's find out how much Tom needs to pay after using the money from his old bedroom set.

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and Tom sells his old one for $1000. So, the amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

**Final Answer:**
200"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

So, she has 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, as she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her clutch of balloons. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's sum up the total number of balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he doesn't have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there's a substitute, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
   - So, the chance he doesn't have to turn it in if there's a substitute is 50%.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\) or 20%
   - So, the chance he doesn't have to turn it in if the normal teacher gives an extension is 20%.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting a personal extension: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\) or 6%
   - So, the chance he doesn't have to turn it in if he gets a personal extension is 6%.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
\[50\% + 20\% + 6\% = 76\%\]

Finally, to find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract the above sum from 100%:
\[100\% - 76\% = 24\%\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for guests after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats for guests = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats for guests = 6000 - 1250
Seats for guests = 4750

Now, we need to divide these seats equally among the graduates.

Number of graduates: 950
Seats for guests: 4750

Tickets per graduate = Seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - This means that 1 medium jelly bean is equivalent to 3 small jelly beans.
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, we need to find out how many small jelly beans this is equivalent to.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate her total parking expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out her net earnings after parking expenses, we subtract the total parking expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \, \text{dollars} - 9 \, \text{dollars} = 36 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:

\[ \frac{36 \, \text{dollars}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Ted buys 3 books for $16 each and 3 pencils for $6 each.

Now, add the cost of the books and pencils to find the total amount spent:
$48 + $18 = $66

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To set off all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 moves (since the first bottle doesn't require a move to start).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds/move} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make if he packs them with eight apples in each pack. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. So, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. So, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money she started with:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out for college. Since he takes out $50,000 per year and it takes him 4 years to finish, the total amount of loans is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After college, his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would have been:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

After college, Jim's income is $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income. The total amount he needs to earn is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year after college, the number of years it will take to earn $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"First, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is:

\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

Then, on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than this amount:

\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. This is 5 more than twice the amount delivered on Tuesday:

\[ 2 \times 102 + 5 = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we add up the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters Monday - Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each pasta salad costs $6.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of both salads to find the total amount:
- Total cost = cost of chicken salad + cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **101 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Adding $1 to that: \(10 + 1 = 11\).
   - So, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).
   - So, he lost $16.5 in the third race.

4. **Total Amount Lost:**
   - First race loss: $5.
   - Second race win: $11 (which is a gain, so we consider it as a positive value).
   - Third race loss: $16.5.
   - Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 - 11 = 10.5\).

5. **Average Loss:**
   - He participated in 3 races.
   - Total loss over 3 races: $10.5.
   - Average loss per race: \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\).

So, the average loss per race is $3.5.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Number of countries in South America**: 26
2. **Number of cities in each country**: 5
3. **Population of each city**: 1000 people

First, we calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[ \text{Total number of cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Number of cities per country} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cities} = 26 \times 5 = 130 \]

Next, we calculate the total population of South America by multiplying the total number of cities by the population of each city:
\[ \text{Total population} = \text{Total number of cities} \times \text{Population per city} \]
\[ \text{Total population} = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000 \]

So, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the growth is given in inches and one of the heights is already in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step.

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day to hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in 3 weeks, there are \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team in 21 days is \( 21 \times 9 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008:
- The price in 2007 is $20,000.
- The depreciation for 2008 is 21% of $20,000.
- Depreciation amount = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200.
- Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

Next, let's find the price of the car in 2009:
- The price in 2008 is $15,800.
- The depreciation for 2009 is 21% of $15,800.
- Depreciation amount = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318.
- Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482.

Finally, let's find the price of the car in 2010:
- The price in 2009 is $12,482.
- The depreciation for 2010 is 21% of $12,482.
- Depreciation amount = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22.
- Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,621.22 = $9,860.78.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we need to find out how many books are in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{10}{100} \times 50 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 German books.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"First, we need to find out how many kilometers Bernice has already driven. According to the problem, she drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. 

So, the total distance she has driven so far is 325 kilometers.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks daily by the number of days:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
\[ 120 + 20 = 140 \]

At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
\[ 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
\[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: The shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The package originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 off coupon, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is **$2400**."
"First, let's find out how much the insurance costs after the accident. The insurance is 60% more than the normal cost.

The normal cost is $120 a month. To find 60% of $120, we calculate:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the additional cost due to the accident is $72. Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means the new monthly cost of the insurance is $192. To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"First, let's figure out how many sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he does this every week, in a year (52 weeks), he uses:
- \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets
- \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do. The machine can wash:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- He has 208 twin sheets
- Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, the number of loads for twin sheets is \(208 \div 2 = 104\) loads

For the king sheets:
- He has 52 king sheets
- Since the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, the number of loads for king sheets is \(52 \div 1 = 52\) loads

Adding the loads for both types of sheets:
- Total loads = 104 (twin) + 52 (king) = 156 loads

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"First, let's figure out how many movies Jill and her friends watch on each day of the weekend.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.

On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. So, on Sunday, they watch:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend (both Saturday and Sunday):
\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. We multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4:
\[ 6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 4 \text{ weekends} = 24 \text{ movies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 24 \]"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many stickers Leo collected this year.
2. Calculate the total number of stickers in his collection now.

**Step 1: Determine how many stickers Leo collected this year.**

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
Leo collected 100 stickers this year.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of stickers in his collection now.**

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he added 50 more stickers to his collection, making the total:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
This year, he added 100 more stickers to his collection, making the total:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \]

So, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection now is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much cat food Imma uses in one day. Since she feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams each time, we can calculate the daily food consumption as follows:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ 720 \, \text{grams} \div 120 \, \text{grams/day} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's figure out how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\)

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \(D + 18\) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \(D\):

\[2D = 80\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(D\):

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part was 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: Each pill costs $4, and she needs 30 pills, so the cost is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

The total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. 

20% of 80 emails don't require any response:
\[ 80 \times \frac{20}{100} = 16 \]

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day.

Now, let's find out how many emails he does need to respond to each day:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. 

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

To find 70% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. To find 80% of 40:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas left.

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony is sending. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so:

\[ \text{Cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so:

\[ \text{Cost for big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:

\[ \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500 \text{ cents}}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"First, let's figure out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering more is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ meatballs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had issues, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ \text{Number of successful deliveries} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ \text{Total tons of fertiliser} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

**300**"
"Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter in total.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for the first pound, he pays $4.00. For the second pound, he gets it at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:

1. First pound: $4.00
2. Second pound: $2.00 (half off)
3. Third pound: $4.00
4. Fourth pound: $2.00 (half off)
5. Fifth pound: $4.00
6. Sixth pound: $2.00 (half off)

Adding these up: $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually come is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. So, we need to calculate the cost for the 21 additional guests (41 - 20 = 21).

Cost for additional guests = 21 guests * $6/guest = $126

Now, we add the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests:

Total cost = $125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The party will cost $251."
"First, let's find out how much money Maggie spent. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and she had $60, we calculate:

\[ \text{Amount Maggie spent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

So, Maggie spent $15. To find out how much money Maggie has left, we subtract the amount she spent from her original amount:

\[ \text{Amount Maggie has left} = 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Next, let's determine how much money Riza spent. Since Riza spent one-third of her money, and she had $60, we calculate:

\[ \text{Amount Riza spent} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Riza spent $20. To find out how much money Riza has left, we subtract the amount she spent from her original amount:

\[ \text{Amount Riza has left} = 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money the two of them have left in total, we add the amounts they each have left:

\[ \text{Total amount left} = 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the two of them have $85 left."
"First, let's find out how many bananas all three monkeys eat in a day. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide this number by 7 to find out how many bananas they eat each day.

\[ \text{Bananas per day} = \frac{315}{7} = 45 \]

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:

\[ \text{Second monkey's bananas per day} = 10 + 4 = 14 \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day:

\[ \text{Third monkey's bananas per day} = 45 - (10 + 14) = 45 - 24 = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

750 pieces"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs more money to cover the cost. The florist can sell roses at $2 each, so Jenny can only buy:

\[ \frac{\$25}{\$2/\text{rose}} = 12.5 \text{ roses} \]

Since Jenny can't buy half a rose, she can only buy 12 roses. The cost for 12 roses is:

\[ 12 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$24 \]

After buying 12 roses, Jenny spends $24 and has:

\[ \$25 - \$24 = \$1 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the remaining $1 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in $1, so Jenny leaves with:

\[ 4 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"

   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, let's add up the totals from each item to find the overall total money made:

- Total from milkshakes: $33
- Total from burger platters: $99
- Total from sodas: $30

Adding these together:

\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

So, the total money Terry makes is:

\(\boxed{162}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long Paul will wait for his train.

1. **First Train:**
   - The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
   - It stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - So, the first train leaves the station 30 minutes after it arrives (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves 30 minutes after it arrives, so the second train arrives 30 minutes after 30 minutes, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, the second train leaves the station 65 minutes after the first train arrives (60 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves 65 minutes after the first train arrives, so the third train arrives 60 minutes after 65 minutes, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves 125 minutes after the first train arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves 125 minutes after the first train arrives, so the fourth train arrives 145 minutes after the first train arrives (125 minutes to leave + 20 minutes to arrive).
   - Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait 145 - 10 = 135 minutes for his train.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach 200 toothpicks. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number required:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many jellyfish one spring creates in one second.
2. Calculate how many jellyfish one spring creates in one hour.
3. Calculate how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours.
4. Finally, calculate how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.

Step 1: Since every second a new jellyfish is created, one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Step 2: There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour. Therefore, one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour.

Step 3: In 4 hours, one spring would create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

Step 4: If 5 springs are working at the same rate, they would create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final numerical answer:
72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, let's calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Distance to the Store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway Point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. **Realization and Return**: James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. **Total Distance Walked**: James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, totaling \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.
5. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

**Final Answer:**
1 hour"
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches.

Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas. So, for 10 bunches, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if she bought these bananas individually.

The cost of one banana is $0.80. So, for 40 bananas, the cost would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches.

The cost of one bunch is $3.00. So, for 10 bunches, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, let's find out how much money she saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The savings would be the difference between the cost of buying bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\)."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth per year is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - So, \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes were sold.

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - So, \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes were sold.

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - So, \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes were sold.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Each Trekking bike is sold for $450.
   - So, \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars from Trekking bikes.

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Each BMX bike is sold for half the price of an MTB, which is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars.
   - So, \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars from BMX bikes.

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Each MTB bike is sold for $500.
   - So, \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars from MTB bikes.

Finally, let's add up the earnings from all the bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \) dollars.

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bales made by the farmer in one hour:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

2. **Determine the number of bales picked up by the truck in one hour:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales left in the field each hour:**
   - Each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales, and the truck picks up 3 bales.
   - Net bales left each hour = Bales made - Bales picked up
   - Net bales left each hour = 5 - 3 = 2 bales

4. **Calculate the total number of bales left in the field over 6 hours:**
   - Since 2 bales are left each hour, over 6 hours, the total number of bales left = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

So, the final number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, let's add the class time and the extra learning time to find the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

So, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"First, we need to determine the height from which the ball bounces on its first bounce. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the ball is dropped from:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the ball reaches:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce. Since the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, we calculate:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child, who is 6 feet tall, is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"To find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so before the T-Rex ate, there were \(1080 \times 2 = 2160\) kilograms of meat.

Therefore, the triceratops had 2160 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's find the total area of all four walls:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of soda remaining after Ellen and her brother took their sodas.

Ellen started with a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. So, there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now there are 8 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. After he took his sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and can get any of the remaining 8 sodas (2 shaken + 6 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. So, the probability is:

\[
\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \boxed{25\%}."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   In 3 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances each train has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off.

- 20% of 50 days is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\) days.

So, the number of days Billy works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

- \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works:

- \(6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

240"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long, which totals 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends:
- 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Now, let's calculate the total time over 5 days:
- 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the discount:

3. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount amount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
4. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the discount:

5. The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. To find the discount amount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
6. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

Finally, let's add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the current balance:

7. Add the cost of the frying pan to the current balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 = 86.00
   \]
8. Add the cost of the set of towels to the new balance:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( J \).

2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

5. To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{15}J = 6
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 15:
   \[
   J = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

90"
"First, let's figure out Ben's age. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. Since Ben is 8 years old, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, Caroline is 24 years old."
"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.

\[ \text{Annual Savings} = 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Lauren will have saved by the time she retires. She plans to save for 20 years.

\[ \text{Total Savings} = 20,000 \times 20 = 400,000 \]

Now, we need to figure out how much money Lauren will need each year during her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.

\[ \text{Annual Retirement Expense} = 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \]

To find out how many years Lauren can live on her savings, we divide her total savings by her annual retirement expense.

\[ \text{Years of Retirement} = \frac{400,000}{40,000} = 10 \]

Since Lauren plans to save for 20 years and can live on her savings for 10 years, she needs to work for an additional 10 years beyond her planned 20 years of savings.

\[ \text{Additional Years Needed} = 10 \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 10 more years."
"First, we need to find the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty cuts from the 100 centimeters of ribbon.

To do this, we divide the total length of the ribbon by 4:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 cm by 5:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the total population is 240 boys. We can set up the equation as follows:

40% of total students = 240 boys

Let's denote the total number of students as \( T \). Then, 40% of \( T \) is 240, which can be written as:

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 60\% \times 600 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"First, let's add the cost of the pots and the garden soil:

- Pots: $19
- Garden soil: $26

Total before coupon: $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we apply the $7 coupon:

So, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, add these two totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

Step 1: Total miles to hike
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

Step 2: Total number of days in June
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day
Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, she plans to hike \(125 \times 2 = 250\) miles per day.

Step 4: Find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike
To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the total miles by the number of days and then subtract the planned miles per day from this result.

First, calculate the miles she needs to hike per day to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles per day} \]

Now, subtract the planned miles per day from the required miles per day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles per day} - 250 \text{ miles per day} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
60"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total cost for each color of ball and then add them together.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total cost for red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total cost for blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total cost for green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

Now, we add the total costs for each color of ball to find the total amount received by the store:

\[
27 + 55 + 75 = 157
\]

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount left for Jacques is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

So, James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Then, it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money Raymond saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's figure out how much money Anna spent in total. She started with $16 and has $2 left, so she spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

We know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount she spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we divide the total amount spent on the books by 2 to find the cost of each book:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each book cost Anna $5. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many students are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate a 20% increase on last year's enrollment of 50 students.

First, we calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

First, we know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then solve the equation:

\[
255x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Now, divide both sides by 255 to solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

\[
\text{It will take 9 minutes.}

"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's pond.

**Initial Count:**
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

**Total Male Fishes:**
- Male guppies + Male goldfishes = 4 + 3 = 7

**Total Female Fishes:**
- Female guppies + Female goldfishes = 7 + 5 = 12

Next, Tate buys more fish:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

**After Buying:**
- New total of male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- New total of female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- New total of male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- New total of female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

**New Total Male Fishes:**
- Male guppies + Male goldfishes = 6 + 5 = 11

**New Total Female Fishes:**
- Female guppies + Female goldfishes = 8 + 8 = 16

Now, we need to find how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:
- Difference = Female fishes - Male fishes = 16 - 11 = 5

**Final Answer:**
Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we add up the time each person took to find the total time:

- Amalia's time: 4 hours
- Megan's time: 6 hours
- Dior's time: 9 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = 19 hours

**Final Answer:**
19 hours"
"First, let's calculate the distance to John's parents' house. Since he drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

This is the one-way distance. Since he makes a round trip, we need to double this distance:

\[ \text{Round Trip Distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to multiply the round trip distance by 2:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers.

The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. So, together they produce:
\[ 6 \, \text{toys/hour} \times 2 \, \text{workers} = 12 \, \text{toys/hour} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. So, together they produce:
\[ 4 \, \text{toys/hour} \times 2 \, \text{workers} = 8 \, \text{toys/hour} \]

Adding these together, the first four workers produce:
\[ 12 \, \text{toys/hour} + 8 \, \text{toys/hour} = 20 \, \text{toys/hour} \]

Since all workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 20 \, \text{toys/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{toys} \]

The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys, and after the first four workers have worked, 200 toys have been produced. By the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means the total number of toys produced by the end of the shift is:
\[ 400 \, \text{toys} - 20 \, \text{toys} = 380 \, \text{toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \, \text{toys} - 200 \, \text{toys} = 180 \, \text{toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \, \text{toys}}{10 \, \text{hours}} = 18 \, \text{toys/hour} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 18 \, \text{toys/hour} \]"
"First, let's find the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of all the dogs together to find the total weight:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris, which means Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, the 16 stickers Luis had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- So, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

- Since 1 ounce of M&M has 30 M&M, 30 ounces will have \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&M.

Now, we need to determine how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

- The total number of small bags he can make is \(900 \div 10 = 90\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half the circumference of the Earth.
2. Determine how many days it takes for Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take for him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

**50 days**"
"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ miles per hour} = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ miles per hour} = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \(V\), then we have:
\[14 = 2V\]

Solving for \(V\):
\[V = \frac{14}{2} = 7\]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now:
\[7 + 2 = 9\]

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Arnold painted \( A \) and the number of eggs Madeline painted \( M \). Since they painted the same number, \( A = M \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted \( S \). So, \( C + S = 30 \).
4. **Camden Painted 12 More Than Sarah**: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

Now, let's substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted:
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]
So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56. We can write the equation for the total as:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:

\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find out the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 400 by 16:

\[ 400 \div 16 = 25 \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \] pounds."
"First, let's find out how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood.

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount he makes from selling all the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

Valerie's brother's earnings = Valerie's earnings * 2
Valerie's brother's earnings = $5000 * 2
Valerie's brother's earnings = $10000

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. So, we first find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = Valerie's earnings + Valerie's brother's earnings
Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = $5000 + $10000
Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = $15000

Now, we calculate their mother's earnings:

Their mother's earnings = Combined salary of Valerie and her brother * 2
Their mother's earnings = $15000 * 2
Their mother's earnings = $30000

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

Total earnings = Valerie's earnings + Valerie's brother's earnings + Their mother's earnings
Total earnings = $5000 + $10000 + $30000
Total earnings = $45000

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, we can calculate her speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she spends 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk, the total time for her 3-mile walk is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the final tree, which had 3 blue birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if we subtract the 24 marbles he receives from the total of 60, we can find out how many marbles he originally has.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles.

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Donny can only drink water that is at least 40 degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the bottle, the temperature of the mixture in the bottle can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water.

The formula for the weighted average temperature is:
\[ \text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, simplify the numerator:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Next, multiply both sides of the inequality by 5 to clear the denominator:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Then, subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks have \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so over 21 days, they bring \(20 \times 21 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over three weeks. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so over 21 days, they bring \(10 \times 21 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added over the three weeks. Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens. After three weeks, the number of cows is \(50 + 420 = 470\) and the number of chickens is \(20 + 210 = 230\).

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the cows and chickens, which is \(470 + 230 = 700\).

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is \(\boxed{700}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the original total cost:

\[ 90\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.90 \times \$40.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 less than 3 scoops:**
   - 1 less than 3 scoops is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

3. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for 2 scoops.

4. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, we need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) sets of 2 scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \) potatoes.

So, the final numerical answer is:
27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jelly beans} + \text{Number of red jelly beans}) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (17 + 34) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - 51 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 9 \]

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree. 

First, let's find out how many lemons he collects from all the trees in one year:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade. A decade is 10 years.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

So, in a decade, Tim gets 300 lemons."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many men and women were on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.**

- Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower costs $2.

To find out how many sunflowers he sells per day, we divide the daily earnings from sunflowers by the cost of one sunflower:
\[ \text{Sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Daily earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Cost per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.**

- Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day.
- We need to find out how many he sells in 3 days.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[ \text{Sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, Faraday was able to sell 39 sunflowers after 3 days.

**Final Answer:**
39"
"First, let's figure out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many rocks he sells. Since he sells 60% of his inventory:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the initial investment:

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scenes and then add them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes = \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes = \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes = \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add up the days required for each type of picture scene:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's find the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles initially.
- Then, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles.
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part of the trip.
- Sid took an additional 3 hours for the second part of the trip.
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket
The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be written as a probability of 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners
The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

### Final Answer
The probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2.

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected.

\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} \]
\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Finally, they divided all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person got 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, for the weekend, he eats:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend, we get:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"First, let's find out how long the second song is. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \times 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the length of the first song to get the length of the second song:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Now, add the lengths of both songs to get the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. So, the selling price is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit from one device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since the profit from selling one device is $20, the total profit from selling 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, Carl's height is:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each juice bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - To cover 100% of the daily energy demand for one person, Hortex would need to produce \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \) bottles of juice.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

2. **Calculate the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex can produce 4200 bottles of juice per day.

3. **Determine the additional bottles needed:**
   - The additional bottles needed are \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

So, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's figure out how many octuplets are dressed in each color:

- Total octuplets: 8
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- Blue-wearers with bows: \( 2 \times \frac{1}{1} = 2 \) (since all blue-wearers wear bows)
- Purple-wearers with bows: \( 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \)

Now, we know that a total of \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) octuplets are wearing bows. Out of these, 2 are wearing purple and 2 are wearing blue.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula for probability:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearing bow wearers}}{\text{Total number of bow wearers}} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."

2. **Reports on Monday and Tuesday**: They received 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday.
3. **Reports on Thursday and Friday**: They received 2136 reports on Thursday and Friday.

First, we calculate the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall number of reports to find out how many were received on Wednesday:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{1125} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold for $50. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, we need to find out how much land he has left after selling 40 square meters:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. So, we calculate 1/4 of the remaining 40 square meters:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land he has left after selling 10 square meters:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, the money he earned from selling the remaining land is:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Initially, there were 36 eggs hidden in the yard. After the children found their eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find 60% of 400 apartments:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}\]

So, the third complex has:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[1248\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's calculate the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, so:
\[ x - 200 = 1000 \]
\[ x = 1200 \]
So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1200 - 200 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can sum up the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 2650 \]

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2650}\)."
"First, let's find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

To find 1/5 of $100, we divide $100 by 5:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we need to add this $20 to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's figure out how much money Rissa and Ronnie initially had.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa had:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \).

After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
\[ 15 - x \]

According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial money. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Solving the right side of the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \]

So, we have:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount, he also gave $3 to their little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used**: The mural used 12 pints of paint in total.

2. **Understand the distribution of colors**:
   - Half of the mural is yellow.
   - The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

3. **Calculate the amount of yellow paint**:
   - Since half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

4. **Calculate the remaining paint for red, white, and purple**:
   - The remaining half of the mural is \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) pints.

5. **Determine the amount of red paint**:
   - The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple.
   - Therefore, the amount of red paint is \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) pints.

So, the number of pints of red paint used is **2**."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then add them all together.

1. **Monday**: Alice counted 3 clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She saw double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) clouds.
3. **Wednesday**: She saw double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) clouds.
4. **Thursday**: She saw double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) clouds.
5. **Friday**: She saw double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) clouds.

Now, we add up the clouds from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 clouds."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the price of the box and then by $1:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ pods per dollar} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, for $1, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 twenty-dollar bills to pay for the bill. The number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 twenty-dollar bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"First, let's determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday.

1. Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:
   \[
   45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Calculate the amount of chalk remaining after Monday:
   \[
   5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

3. Calculate the amount of chalk used each day (20% of the remaining chalk):
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 2.75 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. Determine the amount of chalk remaining after each day:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after 1 day} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 0.55 \text{ inches} = 2.20 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after 2 days} = 2.20 \text{ inches} - 0.55 \text{ inches} = 1.65 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after 3 days} = 1.65 \text{ inches} - 0.55 \text{ inches} = 1.10 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. Check if the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches after each day:
   - After 1 day: 2.20 inches (not less than 2 inches)
   - After 2 days: 1.65 inches (not less than 2 inches)
   - After 3 days: 1.10 inches (less than 2 inches)

The teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 3 days because it will be less than 2 inches.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find out how many students are on varsity in total:

\[ 4 \text{ (girls on varsity)} + 3 \text{ (boys on varsity)} = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[ 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]

To find out how many students are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"Mike bought 5 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we first calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought:

Thrice the number of masks Mike bought = 3 * 5 = 15

Now, we add 2 to this number to find out how many masks Johnny bought:

Johnny's masks = 15 + 2 = 17

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's figure out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so if he drills 4 teeth, he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Next, we need to find out the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist fixes the teeth by drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

Now, we need to find out what percentage of James' teeth this is. James has 30 teeth in total. The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}}\right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"First, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

To find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the refund for 1600 gallons would be:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of:
\[ \$5600 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
   - So, Wendy's age \( W \) is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - Colin's age in 25 years will be \( C + 25 \).
   - So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \).

Now, we can set up the equations based on these statements:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Distribute the 3 and 5:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
Colin is 20 years old."
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

To do this, we divide the total amount of money by the cost for 100 books:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with his $27000. So, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, since Bob distributes this money equally among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school can get:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

1800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket, so he had 1 apple in his pocket and 1 apple in his hand.
3. He then threw the apple in his hand into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples in his hand.
4. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, so he now has 1 apple in his pocket (from before) + 1 apple from the 5 he just picked up = 2 apples in his pocket, and 1 apple in his hand.
5. He then threw the apple in his hand at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, he has 2 apples in his pocket and 6 apples in his hand.
6. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. So, he now has 2 apples in his pocket + 6 apples in his hand = 8 apples.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is \(\$306\)."
"First, let's calculate how many slices of cheese pizza Kate's friends will eat in total. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, and there are 6 friends, so:

\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many slices of pepperoni pizza Kate's friends will eat in total. Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and there are 6 friends, so:

\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

To find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas together:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

First, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. He ran 3 miles each of these days. So, for these three days, the total miles are:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. He ran 5 miles each of these days. So, for these two days, the total miles are:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to get the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[ 19 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many snowballs Jay actually gains in an hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs} \]

So, the net gain of snowballs in an hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he gains 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times \text{hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for hours:
\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

5 hours"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and assuming it started in 1999 (as Digimon was first released in Japan in 1999), it would be 2023 now (1999 + 20 years = 2019, and we are in 2023).

2. **Find out how old John and Jim were 20 years ago:**
   - John is 28 years old now. So, 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
   - At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim was \(8 \div 2 = 4\) years old.

3. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since then, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - Adding the 12 bandages left from the first day, they had \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages before using any on the second day.
   - After using 28 bandages on the second day, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - Adding the 100 bandages and subtracting the 25 bandages used, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages before the end of the third day.
   - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so the number of bandages they started with on the first day must be \(109 - 78 = 31\).

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{31}\)."

"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week. She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week.

\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5.

\[ 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 67.5 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen did not have any absences, she will receive an additional $10 for each week.

\[ 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add her weekly earnings to the additional amount for her perfect attendance.

\[ 67.5 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} + 40 \, \text{dollars} = 270 \, \text{dollars} + 40 \, \text{dollars} = 310 \, \text{dollars} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add up all the people who entered the restaurant:

- Morning: 50 people
- At 10:00: 40 people
- After 10:00: 80 people
- Evening: 150 people

Total number of people = \(50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\)

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"First, let's calculate the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. She bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. The problem states that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. So, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the first day, he planted a total of \(20 + 40 = 60\) trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the second day, he planted a total of \(30 + 50 = 80\) trees.

Adding the trees from both days, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius is \(60 + 80 = 140\).

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, and it will be shared equally among the 3 people. So, the amount of root beer each person gets is:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The problem states: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.""

We can translate this into a mathematical equation. Let's use \( x \) to represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

The phrase ""four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as \( 4x \).

The phrase ""eight more than"" means we add 8 to the previous expression, so we get \( 4x + 8 \).

According to the problem, this expression equals 40. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \).

First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we know that 5/11 of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.

Amy had:
- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, we account for the colors stolen by her sister. Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\]

Subtracting these 3 colors from the remaining total:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \)
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \)

Since the house is two stories, we need to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches high. Therefore, the height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof is:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = \frac{40}{100} \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = \frac{60}{100} \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles all dogs need to walk per day.
2. Subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total to find out how many miles the last dog needs.

First, we know the average miles per day for all 4 dogs is 3 miles. So, the total miles for all 4 dogs is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the miles the first three dogs need:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much John got from the loan. The loan is worth 40% of the house's value, which is $250,000.

To find 40% of $250,000, we calculate:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John got a loan worth $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

To find 60% of $100,000, we calculate:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is:
\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna. Since the cost of tuna is $0.50 per kilogram, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

So, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"First, we need to find out the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we need to find the profit. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting for the specified number of days.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we add up the total amount of water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"First, let's find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons in each pack. So, the total number of balloons they had at the start is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons/pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose.

1. For one dose, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
2. The amount of the second medicine in one dose is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.
3. Therefore, the total amount of medicine in one dose is \(14 + 42 = 56\) mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[56 \text{ mL/dose} \times 8 \text{ doses} = 448 \text{ mL}\]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has the capacity of 1/8 of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know the capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = \text{Capacity of Ali's school} + \text{Capacity of John's school} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest.

The original amount borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300.

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months.

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. So, we need to find half of 10:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diaper changes, Jordan changes the other half:

\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes (by wife)} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and the estimated number is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."

   - The bus started with 20 people.

2. **People entering at the first stop:**
   - 40 people entered the bus.
   - Total people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\).

3. **People entering at the second stop:**
   - \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\).
   - Total people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\).

4. **People entering at the third stop:**
   - The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Total people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

5. **Remaining spaces on the bus:**
   - The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
   - Remaining spaces: \(200 - 180 = 20\).

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost increases by 150% of $2.

150% of $2 is calculated as:
\[ 150\% \times 2 = 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of visits Pauline made over the 8 years. She visits the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years, she made:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits} \]

In the next 3 years, she also made:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]

Adding these together, the total number of visits is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for all these visits. With each visit costing $5, the total cost is:
\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

   - So, the total number of students is \(10 \times 4 = 40\).

2. **Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed:**
   - Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by 8.
   - \(40 \div 8 = 5\).

3. **Calculate the total time needed:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room.
   - Since there are 5 groups, the total time is \(5 \times 45 = 225\) minutes.

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"First, let's figure out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs.

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the pounds of ground beef needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much of his secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need for 5 pounds of ground beef. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef:

\[ \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window:

\[ 5 \text{ windows} \times 35 \text{ inches/window} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.
   - So, the total cost for the first 16 minutes is \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The total call duration is 36 minutes, and the first 16 minutes are already accounted for.
   - Therefore, the remaining minutes are \( 36 - 16 = 20 \) minutes.
   - The cost per minute for the remaining 20 minutes is $0.20.
   - So, the total cost for the remaining 20 minutes is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the cost of the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes, we get \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cupcakes Carly makes be \( c \).
2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]
3. Each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]
5. Substitute the expression for \( b \) from step 2 into the equation from step 4:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]
7. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount on both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

1. **Determine how many paintings Shelley has:**
   - We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
   - Samantha has 27 paintings.
   - Therefore, Shelley has \(27 + 12 = 39\) paintings.

2. **Determine how many paintings Kim has:**
   - We know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
   - Shelley has 39 paintings.
   - Therefore, Kim has \(39 - 8 = 31\) paintings.

So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

To find 80% of $40:
\[ 80\% \times 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price after a 50% decrease, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from $72.

50% of $72 is:
\[ 50\% \times 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]

So, the price in January after the decrease is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:
\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For 2 lessons at the reduced rate, he earns:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ 440 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Next, we count the number of quizzes:
There are 9 quizzes.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes to find the mean:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining 36 apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36.

\[ 25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he gave 9 to his sister.

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's say the number of novels Regina has written this year is \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. So, we can write the equation as:

\[
9 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
\]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

**Final Answer:**
12"
"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he doesn't stop at all, which is not realistic but we'll use this for calculation), the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes used by her brother as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

So, Madeline's brother used 30 grapes.

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes and their mother made 4 pies, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes used for the grape juice and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 30 + 48 = 78 \]

Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, we need to add these to the total number of grapes used for the juice and pies to find out how many grapes were there at the beginning:

\[ 78 + 6 = 84 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School.
2. Subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers to the remaining number of teachers.

Let's do the math:

1. Total number of teachers = 82
2. Number of sick teachers = 13
3. Number of substitute teachers = 9

First, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to the remaining number of teachers:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the final number of teachers at school that day is:
\[ 78 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for one batch of macaroni and cheese:

1. The cost of pasta is $1.00.
2. The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
3. The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's add up the costs for one batch:
\[1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00\]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), the total cost is:
\[10.00 \times 52 = 520.00\]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are needed to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe.

To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) and the total time available in a day (480 minutes):

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

However, this result indicates the total time required to clean all classrooms in terms of the daily working hours, which means the custodian would need to work more than one full day to clean all the classrooms. Given the constraint of 5 days, the custodian would spend 25% of their day on average cleaning classrooms each day.

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"First, let's figure out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- One bookcase has 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf.
- So, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(2 \times 10 + 20 + 15 = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

- \(110 \div 55 = 2\)

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer: 2**"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The cost per dozen is $2.40, so the total cost for five dozens is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell from 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we know that Skyler has 50 red hats. This means the remaining hats are:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"First, let's find out the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount, so:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the bag of beef jerky costs $15.00 after the discount.

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This means each stick of beef jerky costs $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we remember that $1.00 is equal to 100 cents. So, $0.50 is:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

Each stick of jerky costs 50 cents."
"First, let's find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in total to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we need to determine how many questions she got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games she has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game.

First, let's find the total number of games:
- Ara plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we calculate the total points:
- Ara scores 21 points per game.
- She has played 160 games.

So, the total points are:
\[ 21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This left him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, he found out one of them was a bead and got rid of it. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to buy 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 buys a car.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"First, let's count the flashlights. Since there is one flashlight for each person and there are 4 people, the total number of flashlights is:
4 flashlights

Next, let's count the candles. There are 8 rooms in total. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. So, we calculate the number of rooms in each half:
8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms

For the 4 rooms with small candles:
4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles

For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

Adding the small and medium candles together:
16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together:
4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using a total of 40 candles and flashlights."
"Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. So, the total number of chips is:

\[ 55 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 110 \text{ chips} \]

His family has five members, and they all get the same number of chips. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \text{ chips} \div 5 \text{ people} = 22 \text{ chips/person} \]

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First side**: It takes John 5 minutes.
2. **Second and third sides**: Each takes twice the time of the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. **Fourth and fifth sides**: Each takes half the time of the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. **Sixth side**: Once the fifth side is done, the sixth side is done, and it also takes 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes

Adding these times together:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5 \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 32.5 minutes.

**Final answer: 32.5 minutes**"
"First, let's figure out how many robots Dominick saw. The problem states that there were half as many robots as helmets. Since there were 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of helmets}\)
Number of robots = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20\)
Number of robots = 10

Next, we know there were 20 helmets.

Now, let's find out how many footballs there were. The problem states that there were half as many helmets as footballs. So, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

Number of footballs = \(2 \times \text{Number of helmets}\)
Number of footballs = \(2 \times 20\)
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we add up all the items Dominick saw:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"First, let's find out how many minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and he spends 6 hours at work each day, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in a day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"First, let's calculate the drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes to dry one painting.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes to dry one painting.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.

The difference in drying time is:
- \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"First, let's calculate the water needed for each group of plants.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

3. To find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we subtract the number of the other plants from the total:
\[ 20 \text{ total plants} - 4 \text{ plants} - 8 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants} \]
These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add up all the water needed:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find out how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land and swim in water, and then add these times together.

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We can find this by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people} \]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people} \]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add up the number of people Conor saw each day to get the total for the week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ 480 \]"
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"First, let's figure out how much lemon juice Tim needs for the lemonade.

For 4 gallons of lemonade, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup of lemon juice per gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he needs:
\[ 1 \text{ cup of lemon juice} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

So, in total, Tim needs:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to find out how many lemons he needs for 6 cups of juice, we calculate:
\[ 6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 36 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons."
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for each type of dog and then multiply by 7 days.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- So, the total daily consumption for German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- So, the total daily consumption for Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
- The total daily consumption is \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

Finally, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
- The total weekly consumption is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

So, the Kennel house will need \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.
- So, the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.
- So, the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
- Total number of legs = \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
- Number of pairs of legs = \(80 \div 2 = 40\) pairs.

So, the final numerical answer is:
40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks. According to the problem, this total is 32 blocks. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in each direction and then determine his final distance from his house.

1. **Traveling West:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Traveling East:**
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Calculating Final Distance from Home:**
   - Elvis first travels 90 miles west.
   - Then he travels 144 miles east.
   - The net distance from his house is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
   - Net distance: \( 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles} \)

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the boat's value after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find out how many pink candies there are, we first need to figure out how many of each of the other colors there are.

1. **Red Candies**: We are told there are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ orange candies}
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ yellow candies}
   \]

Next, we add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies to find out how many candies are not pink:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \text{ candies}
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total:
\[
232 - 189 = 43 \text{ pink candies}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add the weight of the children together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add all the weights together:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to move the car. To find 1% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[ 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force he needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3 weeks:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18.

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Since each ice cream cone costs $1.25, we need to find out the total cost for 4 ice cream cones:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the ice cream cones is $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan has $13 left.

Next, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, he can buy 2 movie tickets.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen's total spending is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, Lani's total spending is:
\[ 30 + 100 + 100 = 230 \]

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add Ellen's and Lani's total spending together:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ 335 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Now, let's add up the cost of ingredients for one jar:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Next, we calculate the profit for one jar by subtracting the cost of ingredients from the selling price:
$50 (selling price) - $44 (cost of ingredients) = $6 (profit per jar)

Finally, to find the total profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 (profit per jar) * 10 jars = $60

So, the final numerical answer is:
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them all together.

   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - The value of the nickels is \(120 \times 0.05 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - The value of the pennies is \(750 \times 0.01 = 7.50\) dollars.

Now, we add the values of all the coins together:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

The total dollar amount in the jar is **$31**."
"First, let's add up all the money Janet spent:

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's sum these amounts:

$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet spent a total of $27.00.

Next, we subtract the total amount spent from the money her parents gave her:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

**$13.00**"
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate how much he makes in a week. Since he gets paid $4 per car, in a week he makes:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Josh makes \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in 2 weeks."

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

First, let's find out how many toy soldiers are in each half:
12 toy soldiers / 2 = 6 toy soldiers

Now, let's calculate the money he would earn from selling the first half:
6 toy soldiers * $5/toy = $30

Next, let's calculate the money he would earn from selling the second half:
6 toy soldiers * $7/toy = $42

Finally, let's add the money from both halves to find the total amount:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that each day, the net number of holes filled is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net filled/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies made is 7995.
The number of rainbow cookies is 2595.
The number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 (rainbow cookies) + 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 5670

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
7995 (total cookies) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal cookies) = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers he actually brought as \( x \)

3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - 5 = 2
\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs in the second basket.
2. Add the number of eggs in both baskets together.

Step 1: The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket. So, we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]
So, the second basket has 20 eggs.

Step 2: Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total money raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

1. **Vanessa's Speed and Distance:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

2. **Aaron's Speed and Distance:**
   - Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but he ran half the distance she did.
   - Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

3. **Aaron's Speed:**
   - Aaron's speed can be calculated as \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Vanessa's Speed:**
   - Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).

5. **Time for Vanessa to Run 4 Miles:**
   - Using Vanessa's speed, the time to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, he needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals each night, and each meal costs $5. So, the cost of the meals per night is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per night.

So, the total cost per night is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(15 \times 2 = \$30\).

However, the question asks how much they make a week, not how much they spend. Since the problem does not specify any income, we can assume the question is about the cost, which is the amount they spend on food and wine.

Final numerical answer:
\(\$30\)."
"First, let's find out the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price of each watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Selling price} = \text{Cost price} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's figure out Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

James is twice as old as Dora. So, James is \(9 \times 2 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 32 when his son James was born, and James is currently 18, John is now \(32 + 18 = 50\) years old.

The question asks how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. Since the youngest son was born when John was 32, and we are not given any information about the youngest son's current age, we can assume the question is asking about the age of the youngest son in 3 years from the time of his birth.

If the youngest son was born when John was 32, and we are asked about his age in 3 years, the answer is simply 3 years old plus the 3 years we are adding to the future, which is \(3 + 3 = 6\) years old.

Final numerical answer:

   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.80:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the radiator costs $320 after the discount.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

To find the total cost for the mechanic, we multiply $50 by 3:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the mechanic charges $150 for the installation.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{470} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's use some basic algebra. Let's say the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out the total number of pizza slices. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. This means the slices need to be shared among 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
