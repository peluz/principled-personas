"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."

"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to account for the $50,000 Josh spent on repairs. The total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3. Since every second glass is at the reduced price, for 16 glasses, 8 glasses will be at the full price and 8 glasses will be at the reduced price.

Calculate the total cost for the glasses at the full price:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Calculate the total cost for the glasses at the reduced price:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Add these two amounts to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse based on the relationships provided.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

**Final Answer**: 260"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file at the normal rate of 2 GB/minute.

40% of 200 GB is:
\[ 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB again.

The time to download the entire 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding up all the time:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to download the file is:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

This means John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The remaining time is:

\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]

The distance he covers in this time is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances he covered while driving:

\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially was 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the final total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Costs**: Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.
3. **Annual Income**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual income is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the annual income minus the annual cost, which is \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

We need to find the number of years, \(n\), such that the total profit (initial cost plus net profit over \(n\) years) becomes positive.

The total profit after \(n\) years is given by:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = -90 + 7.5n \]

We need to find the smallest \(n\) such that:
\[ -90 + 7.5n > 0 \]

Solving for \(n\):
\[ 7.5n > 90 \]
\[ n > \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n > 12 \]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, \(n = 13\).

So, it will take \(\boxed{13}\) years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)
   - Profit: \( 5125 - 5000 = 125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)
   - Profit: \( 8096 - 8000 = 96 \)

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry purchase to maximize profit, which would be $125 at the end of the month. 

**Final Answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent walking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Determine the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the water from both the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[
6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the difference between Samantha's current age and the age of Raymond's son when he was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years before Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Billy sold DVDs to his first 3 customers, each buying 1 DVD, which totals 3 DVDs. Then, he sold DVDs to his next 2 customers, each buying 2 DVDs, which totals 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. 

So, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 = 7\).

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length is:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

   - Total cost = \( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \) dollars.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of \( \boxed{243} \) dollars on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance to the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, calculate the distance from the start of the trip to the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Next, calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance to the first stop from the distance to the second stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Sum of guesses} = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

\[
\text{Number of guesses} = 3
\]

\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

"First, calculate the daily care hours for one dog:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, calculate the weekly care hours by multiplying the daily care hours by the number of days in a week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends:
\[ \boxed{35} \text{ hours a week} \]
taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. 

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since John initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165 on video games and had $5 left, it indicates that he did not use all the lego sets he initially had. However, the question asks how many lego sets he still has, which implies he used all the lego sets he had to get the $195.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ 0 \]

John still has 0 lego sets."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \( \boxed{10} \) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \div 4 = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s, then Ben’s iPhone is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s, Brandon’s iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine how many pieces were taken by the guests. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the initial number of pieces minus the remaining pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories one serving of chips contains:
\[ 250 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Now, we calculate how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can find out how many grams correspond to 0.8 servings:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

Finally, we calculate how many grams of chips can be eaten with 0.8 servings:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams per serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, we divide the total number of candles by 10:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
104
\]"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchases and usage.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package.

First, let's establish the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had:
- Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.

Next, let's account for the Post-it notes she used at work:
- She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

After purchasing the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had would be:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes remaining would be:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after all this, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, the number of blue ties he bought is:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties. Since he bought 10 red ties and each costs $60, the total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM).
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys need to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360

- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- Total revenue for Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]
- Total revenue for Friday:
  \[
  480
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. The revenue on Thursday is $520 and on Friday is $480. The difference in revenue is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40
\]

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the kittens from the adopted ones and the house cats:

\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

The final numerical answer is:
40"

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

1. The cost of one movie ticket is $7.
2. The cost of popcorn is $7.
3. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this $14 with his $42.

4. We divide $42 by $14 to find the number of trips: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total weight the bridge can carry:**
   \[
   \text{Bridge weight limit} = 5000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the weight of the empty truck and the driver:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the empty truck and driver} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the empty truck and driver:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25 = \(0.20 \times 25 = 5\)
- Sour oranges: 2

Now, we can calculate the number of good oranges by subtracting the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)
Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Good oranges = 25 - 8
Good oranges = 17

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we calculate the total cost of the materials and construction:

\[ \text{Total cost of materials and construction} = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost:

\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of materials and construction to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

Therefore, Janet paid a total of \(\$1430\)."
"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of her pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension amount is calculated as:
\[ 5\% \times \$50,000 = 0.05 \times \$50,000 = \$2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension will be the base pension plus the additional 5%:
\[ \$50,000 + \$2,500 = \$52,500 \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the increased pension amount for the remaining 10 years. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
\[ \$52,500 \]

\$52,500"
"First, let's calculate the amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, for 6 months (half a year), the cost is:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced monthly charge for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less, so the new monthly charge is:

\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]

For the second half of the year, which is also 6 months, the cost is:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs of the first and second halves of the year to find the total amount paid by Aleena for the entire year:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's efficiency is:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the mpg we calculated:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 1 coach for each team.

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 1 (girls) + 1 (boys) = 2 coaches

Therefore, for each school:
- Total number of people = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total number of people = 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

\[ \boxed{595} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Given that there are 5 students for every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

   \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes each weekday and 8 classes on Saturday. There are 5 weekdays, so the total number of classes from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Adding the 8 classes on Saturday:

\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students attend these classes. Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is:

\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is:

\[ 495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$7425.00 \]"

- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Money from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129.

Next, calculate the money raised from selling cheesecake slices:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Money from cheesecake = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92.

Finally, add the two amounts together to get the total money raised:
- Total money raised = $129 + $92 = $221.

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.

So, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\)."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:
1. 4th level: 16 square feet
2. 3rd level: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet
3. 2nd level: \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet
4. 1st level: \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} = 60\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[60\]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final numerical answer:**

"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond and David do based on the given relationships.

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Let \( D \) be the amount of laundry David does.
   - Therefore, \( 4D = 400 \) pounds.
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds.

2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Let \( R \) be the amount of laundry Raymond does.
   - Therefore, \( R = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"First, we calculate the total number of roses Dan has by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:

\[ 3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we find the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First alarm:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is directly proportional to the duration).

3. **Third alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three alarms:
\[ 4 \text{ (first alarm)} + 4 \text{ (second alarm)} + 2 \text{ (third alarm)} = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the guests will attend. 

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to show up is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend:

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster, which is equivalent to running 90% of his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, we calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, and Freda's batch made 32 ounces of sauce, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

Therefore, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 more potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she gives away from her total gives:

"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

6 pages per day"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"

"First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height.

The inner volume of one box is:
\[3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"Let's break down the time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- **Thursday**: 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- **Friday**: 2 hours (2 one-hour episodes).

Adding these up, we get:
\[2 \text{ (Monday + Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback reward, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate and then find the average, we need to calculate the area of the roll-ups each person had.

First, let's calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had:
- Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had:
- Marcell's roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the number of roll-ups each person had to find the total number of roll-ups:
- Total number of roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average number of roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. Given that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     300 = 50x
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{50} = 6

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: \$100.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \$80.
   - Combined total original cost: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Prices have increased by 50%.
   - New price per board: \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board: \( \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

3. **Total selling price:**

"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, the cost for one child is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars. For 3 children, the total cost is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) dollars.

Therefore, John paid \(\boxed{360}\) dollars."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

"First, let's determine Lylah's initial salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's initial salary. Then:

\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (40%) from her initial salary of $30,769.23:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.692 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

"Sadie's sleep pattern for the week can be broken down as follows:

1. On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
2. For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
3. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept each day and then sum them up:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
To find \( Q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we can calculate the total weekly video game time as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:
- Milk: Food (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% tax = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

Adding the tax to the non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items with tax:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Total cost of everything = Total cost of food items + Total cost of non-food items with tax
Total cost of everything = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

Final numerical answer:
16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
John has 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.
First, calculate the number of pineapples harvested from one hectare in a year:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]
Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 60 bees have now returned.

To find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we need to account for the bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours.

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30 bees
- Bees that returned in the next 6 hours: 15 bees
- Bees that left in the following 6 hours: 60 bees

So, the number of bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ bees} \]

These 15 bees plus the 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours will return in the last 6 hours:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

Time taken by Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute

Time taken by Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, and the loser is Tim. The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Now, we determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. **Final number of fries**: 5
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: 5 + 1 = 6 fries
3. **Before the raccoon took two-thirds**: The raccoon took two-thirds, so the remaining one-third is 6. Therefore, the number of fries before the raccoon took them is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
4. **Before the pigeons ate**: Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, the number of fries before the pigeons ate is \(18 + 9 = 27\).
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 7 fries (since Dave ate 14 fries). Therefore, the number of fries before the seagull ate is \(27 + 7 = 34\).
6. **Before Dave ate 14 fries**: The number of fries before Dave ate is \(34 + 14 = 48\).

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in classes.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days in a week is:
\[3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes:

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in classes.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days in a week is:
\[2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week by adding the hours from both types of days:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one semester is:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[272\]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}.\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. **Cost of pens**: Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each.
   \[
   4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = \$6
   \]

2. **Cost of notebooks**: Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each.
   \[
   2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = \$8
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**: Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper at $20.
   \[
   1 \text{ rim of bond paper} \times \$20 = \$20
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount Raphael spent.
\[
\$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34
\]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of \$34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which doesn't change the total number of tadpoles he sees because they were already part of the 11. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so Finn can no longer see those 2.

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we subtract the 2 hidden tadpoles from the initial count:

11 - 2 = 9

Finn can now see 9 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.
- Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total fish caught by both = 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price = $20
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase every two months:**
   - Increase every two months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months = 36 / 2 = 18

4. **Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months:**
   - Total increase = Increase every two months * Number of two-month periods
   - Total increase = $4 * 18 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months:**
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92."
"Given:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

We know:
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- An action figure costs $5.

First, calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
- Each red car costs $4, and there are 5 red cars, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
- Each action figure costs $5, and there are 3 action figures, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Finally, add up the costs of all the toys:
- Cost of red cars: $20
- Cost of action figures: $15
- Cost of the doll: $15

Total cost = \(20 + 15 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

The total worth of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 per hour for 3 hours.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference in money:**
   - Net difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Net difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs required is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Next, calculate the miles walked on the weekend:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, add the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of each bird based on the given information and then sum their ages.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Since Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two's age is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:
\[ 8 \text{ (Sally Thirtytwo)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} = 41 \]

The total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{41}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and he has 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut them:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue and the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made $25 in profit.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost.
   - Profit = Revenue - Cost
   - $25 = Revenue - \( C \)
   - Therefore, Revenue = \( C + 25 \)

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $5.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - Total cost = \( 5G \)

3. **Calculate the total revenue in terms of glasses:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Total glasses = \( 20G \)
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - Total revenue = \( 20G \times 0.50 = 10G \)

4. **Set up the equation for profit:**
   - \( 10G = 5G + 25 \)
   - Simplify to find \( G \):
     \[
     10G - 5G = 25
     \]
     \[
     5G = 25
     \]
     \[
     G = 5
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Total cost of lemons = \( 3G = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"First, let's determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the donation, the remaining amount is:
\[
\text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
\[
\text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after all these expenses and donations.
\[
\text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, Monic has:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs}
   \]
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, Rani has:
   \[
   36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[
40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

The total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"Lloyd earns $10 per hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is:
\[ 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was:

\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:

\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \]

This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we add 2 years to Mark's current age to find Jean's age:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 212 \text{ seconds} = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the small rodents:**
   - Total straw for small rodents = 160 pieces.

4. **Calculate the number of pieces of straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw for small rodents = straw for hamsters + straw for rabbits + straw for rats.
   - Therefore, straw for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

5. **Determine the number of rats and the straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let the number of rats in each cage be \(x\).
   - Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats = \(3x\).
   - Total straw for rats = \(3x \times 6 = 18x\).
   - We know that \(18x = 90\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{90}{18} = 5\).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

The formula for the amount after each month with compound interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate.
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

For 3 months, the calculation is:
\[ A = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is $106.12.

**Final Answer**: $106.12"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying and the transportation cost.
   - Total cost = \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue for \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them paid:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is \(\boxed{91}\)."

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark's total weekly earnings are:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has:
- Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.
- She also has 54 blue pens and 12 red pens.

The total number of pens Janet has now is:
\[22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98\]

So, Janet has \(\boxed{98}\) pens now."
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 over 6 tests:**
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

2. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score after removing the lowest score (which is 71) should be 558:**
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 558
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   367 + x = 558
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 558 - 367 = 191
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{191}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

1. **First Period:**
   - He rode 5 times a week.
   - Each ride was 25 kilometers.
   - He did this for 4 weeks.
   - Total distance for the first period: \(5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km}\).

2. **Second Period:**
   - He rode 2 times a week.
   - Each ride was 60 kilometers.
   - He did this for 3 weeks.
   - Total distance for the second period: \(2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km}\).

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of the distances from both periods: \(500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km}\).

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she mows the lawn is \(10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\) dollars.

To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we set up the equation:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[4x = 70 - 30\]
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4}\]
\[x = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. So,

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers counted on the third day is:
\[500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her hourly wage is $8.00. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months.

The total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned.

The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are \(4 + 7 = 11\) dahlias.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's determine how many points each student scored based on the information given.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate half of Naomi's points and then add 10:
   \[
   \text{Half of Naomi's points} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. We can now calculate Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collected rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- After losing 8 water type cards, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards.
- After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type card. The probability is given by the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.3333\ldots \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the combined rate at which they can place pieces together:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

30% of 120 watermelons are ready for harvest:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the subtotal.

\[ \text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the subtotal to get the final amount Mark pays.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the second cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the third cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fourth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.

After the fifth cycle, he will have 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fifth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he will have 25 pens again, but he will not be able to make any more new pens because he will have less than 5 pens left.

Adding up all the pens, we get:
- Initial pens: 25
- Pens from first cycle: 5
- Pens from second cycle: 5
- Pens from third cycle: 5
- Pens from fourth cycle: 5
- Pens from fifth cycle: 5

So, the total number of pens is \(25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 45\).

The final numerical answer is:

\text{Sum of ages} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68
\]

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. The number of students remaining after this is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. The number of students remaining after this is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count each book being read once.

- Dolly reads her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book = 3 books.
- Pandora reads her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books by the end.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives from each pen pal per week is:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since he is corresponding with 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives from all pen pals per week is:

\[ 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \times 3 \text{ pen pals} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages he writes per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \]

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has \(\boxed{250}\) minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\)
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\)
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after Ginger gave: \(9 + x\)
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\)
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:**
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\)

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since Jean gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

Therefore, Jean paid:

\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies:

- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300 \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed:**
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{50}{100} \times 60 = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = \frac{50}{100} \times 60 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let the number of cougars killed today be \( x \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3x \).

We also know that today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, \( x = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Thus, today Rick killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves and 12 cougars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:
- Wolves: \( 10 + 36 = 46 \)
- Cougars: \( 15 + 12 = 27 \)

Total animals killed: \( 46 + 27 = 73 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, 8 stalls will have \(8 \times 22 = 176\) cows.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

Therefore, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, determine the weight of the entire redwood before the termites ate any part of it:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, calculate the remaining percentage of the redwood:

\[
100\% - 30\% = 70\%
\]

Now, calculate the weight of the remaining 70% of the redwood:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

\[

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. First, we find the total number of fruits Jamal has:

\[ \text{Total fruits Jamal has} = \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Andrea's total number of fruits is:

\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Adding the total number of fruits Jamal and Andrea have:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Total fruits Jamal has} + \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 92 + 76 = 168 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

So, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to determine how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup. The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300.

To find two-thirds of 9,300, we calculate:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two-thirds of the cup.

Since 100 pennies make up $1.00, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:
\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we first find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

So, Harry has 11 trees. Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee Calculation:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

2. **Transfer Fee Calculation:**
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

3. **Total Price Calculation:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

4. **Difference from Budget:**
   - Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
   - Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

Next, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid:
\[
\text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000

"First, let's break down the time taken for each step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** This takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

**Final answer:**

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the overall total cost:
- The total cost for the newspaper ads is $250.
- The total cost for the television ads is $1125.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on all the ads is \( 250 + 1125 = 1375 \) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) blue golf balls.

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has:

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ M&Ms} \]

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows per house in the bedrooms is:

\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:

\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:

\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

The change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches that the body of the sweater takes, we have:

\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stitches for the rosette. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette by adding the stitches for these parts:

\[ \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ \text{Stitches for the two sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: \( 20 \times 40 = 800 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: \( 80 \times 30 = 2400 \) dollars

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total amount of money used: \( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
3200 dollars"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

Therefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."
"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes:
- Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
- Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes:
- Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
- Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

Now, add the total time for both small and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

**Final numerical answer:**
30"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Sam is 6 years old.**"
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\). Adding the 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas needed is \(\frac{39}{3} = 13\).

Finally, if each pizza costs $15, the total cost for 13 pizzas is \(13 \times 15 = 195\).

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Determine the length of each sterling silver bead:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch long.

4. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

Therefore, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the first five rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the first five rows from the total number of stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars make up these 40 stars:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final numerical answer is:
\[8\]"
"First, calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, determine how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. This is calculated by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Next, we determine how many bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we need to divide these 16 bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Susan earns \(\boxed{75}\) dollars for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members eating rice at each meal, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Next, add the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, subtract the total number of crates sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Bid**: Carmen bids after each of the three other bidders, so her bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Now, we sum up all the bids:
- Opening bid: $200
- First other bidder: $250
- Second other bidder: $300
- Third other bidder: $350
- Carmen's bid: $400

Total cost = $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $400 = $1500

Thus, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1500}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles each day.

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance for a week is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.

Now, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance for a year is \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.

John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total bonus he gives his driver. Since he gives a $150 bonus per month and there are 50 weeks in a year, he works 10 months in a year (assuming he doesn't work in the 10 weeks of the year that are not part of the 50 weeks). Therefore, the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 10 = 1500\) dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving. The total cost is \(30000 + 1500 = 31500\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31500}

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print four pages: two on the front and two on the back. Specifically, for a 32-page tabloid:

1. The first piece of paper will print pages 1 and 2 on the front, and pages 32 and 31 on the back.
2. The second piece of paper will print pages 3 and 4 on the front, and pages 30 and 29 on the back.
3. This pattern continues until all 32 pages are printed.

Since each piece of paper can print 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper needed:

\[
\frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (the third year).
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - The number of unsold books is 50.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).
   - The number of books sold in the second year is the total sold minus the books sold in the first and third years: \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 65.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:

- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his weekly earnings from hourly wage are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500 \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ extra arms}
   \]

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ extra legs}
   \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ extra arms} + 3 \text{ extra legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
   \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs consumed per day by the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over a week (7 days), the total number of eggs consumed is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \]

years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Final numerical answer:
\[
14

"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. Therefore, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Adding the 20 marbles Solomon bought and the 8 marbles his father gave him, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kg."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of girls**: Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of nongendered children**: The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total number of children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. So, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means 10 people left the party. We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's determine how many men left the party:
\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]
So, 3 men left the party. Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. After 7 women left, the number of women remaining is:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"The book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can confirm this by noting that the 2 loose pencils plus the pencils in the three boxes equal 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils are in the three boxes. Since the total number of pencils is 26 and 2 of those are loose, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils each has:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the three boxes Jam has, which is 24 pencils per box, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ 72 \div 24 = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Effect of Ice Cubes on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes:
     \[
     5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Effect of Cream:**
   - Adding 15 milliliters of cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - Combining the weakening effects from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker}

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people leave with 7 new records.

First, calculate the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends (which is 14):
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount the customer paid after applying the rewards and the coupon:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs.

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we find 40 percent of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard (RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard (the other one) has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 of them. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share after the first year is:

New price per share = $8 * (1 + 50%) = $8 * 1.5 = $12

The value of the shares after the first year is:

Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share after the second year is:

New price per share = $12 * (1 - 25%) = $12 * 0.75 = $9

The value of the shares after the second year is:

Value after second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cows be \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \), we find:
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to consider the number of legs on each type of table and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged tables:
   - There are 40 tables with 4 legs each.
   - Total legs from 4-legged tables = \(40 \times 4 = 160\).

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 3-legged tables:
   - There are 50 tables with 3 legs each.
   - Total legs from 3-legged tables = \(50 \times 3 = 150\).

3. Add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
   - Total legs = \(160 + 150 = 310\).

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son eats in a week. Since he gets 4 cookies 5 days a week, the total is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, the total is:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we add the cookies eaten by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are consumed by them in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Since Jenny buys 36 cookies each week, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:
\[ 2 \text{ shirts} \times \$30 \text{ per shirt} = \$60 \]

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$60 = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Davos paid:
\[ \$60 - \$24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid \(\$36\) for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in daily revenue:

\[ \text{Difference in revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase in revenue, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for food is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for treats is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for medicine is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the costs for a year:
\[ 1200 \text{ (food)} + 240 \text{ (treats)} + 1200 \text{ (medicine)} = 2640 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To determine the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga Class (Monday)**: The yoga class lasts 1 hour.
2. **Cooking Class (Tuesday)**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class. Therefore, the cooking class lasts \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Cheese-Tasting Event (Wednesday)**: The cheese-tasting event lasts 0.5 hours (30 minutes).
4. **Museum Tour (Thursday)**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class. Therefore, the museum tour lasts \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Errands (Friday)**: The errands take 2 hours.

Now, we sum up the hours for all activities:
\[ 1 \text{ (yoga)} + 3 \text{ (cooking)} + 0.5 \text{ (cheese-tasting)} + 1.5 \text{ (museum tour)} + 2 \text{ (errands)} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she earns from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"

Then, we will subtract these costs from her budget to find out how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   - One round of mini-golf costs $5.

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person:**
   - One ride on the go-karts costs $10.
   - Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, the total amount saved over 5 days is:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy had left after buying the gumballs is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying the gumballs is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Billy spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 16/2 = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:

"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Carver just turned 45 years old, so \( C = 45 \).
2. Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age, which can be written as \( C = 2S - 5 \).

Substituting \( C = 45 \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 20 days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Mark needs \(\boxed{23}\) pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Adding the times for both segments:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring these 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who has 8 points.

"To determine the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY approach and subtract that from the original market price.

1. Calculate the savings from the DIY approach:
   - The savings is 20% of the original price.
   - Original price = $400.
   - Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.

2. Subtract the savings from the original price to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold over the three days, we add the pairs sold each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk from both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."

"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

pupils who do not like blue. Out of these remaining 20 pupils, one-fourth likes green. So, the number of pupils who like green is:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the apples picked on Monday were all sold, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14 apples. Therefore:

\[
\text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks, and 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is:

\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \]

To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies and received 42 more from Janet. So, the total number of cookies she had before her brother ate any is:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Her brother then ate 44 cookies. To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

So, the final number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance hiked by Cho = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance hiked by Cho} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance hiked by Chloe = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance hiked by Cho} - \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, her profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups and sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, her profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost: $30 (for the ride bracelet).
- Dasha's cost: $36 (for tickets).

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discounted cost. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original cost:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of his previous cable subscription, which was $60 per month.

The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the daily energy consumption if the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours):
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since Allan has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. Therefore, the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. Adding the new totals together, we get:

\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

1. **Number of employees at the start of June**: 40
2. **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June**: 
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 30 employees, the total pay in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 30 \text{ employees} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars (May)} + 72000 \text{ dollars (June)} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ 168000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00. Therefore, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The total cost is $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it is worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we find the total cost of the fireworks before the discount by adding the cost of the first pack, the second pack, and the finale firework:

\[ 400 + 800 + 150 = 1350 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1350:

\[ 0.20 \times 1350 = 270 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Tim spent:

\[ 1350 - 270 = 1080 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1080} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12 cookies) at a time, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us the percentage of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, which is 5%.

Given that Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, we can infer that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. This is because 100% - 99% = 1%.

Now, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are both defective (smell like wet dog) and expected to explode. Since 5% of the candles are defective and 1% of the candles are expected to explode, we need to find the intersection of these two groups.

First, calculate the number of candles that are defective:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to assume that the defect (smelling like wet dog) and the explosion are independent events. Therefore, the probability that a candle is both defective and expected to explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are expected to explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:

\[ \text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Joanne's total apples are:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, her sister's total apples are:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer:**
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps is 304, and since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

The number of feet Oliver must climb is:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave $4000, the second bank gave:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the sale price of the tattered jeans is $28. The savings from the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings from the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \). According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2 and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. Therefore, we have:
\[ J - 22 = 2 \]
\[ T - 28 = 4 \]

Solving these equations, we get:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]
\[ T = 28 + 4 = 32 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $32. The difference in the original prices is:
\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. According to the problem, each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, each of Lillian's homemade bird feeders attracts:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders. Lillian buys 3 store-bought bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by these feeders is:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade bird feeders. Lillian builds 3 homemade bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by these feeders is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders:

\[ 60 + 90 = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has left after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each.
   - The total number of hotdogs prepared is \(18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Attendance:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - This means that 20 guests (half of 40) would need a second hotdog, and the other 20 guests would need only one hotdog.
   - The total number of hotdogs required is \(20 \times 2 + 20 \times 1 = 40 + 20 = 60\) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is 60.
   - The shortfall in hotdogs is \(60 - 54 = 6\) hotdogs.

4. **Determine the Number of Guests Without a Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each second hotdog is for one guest, the 6 hotdogs are for 6 guests.
   - Therefore, 6 guests did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
6 guests did not get a second hotdog."

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the perimeter formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Initially, Marcus's house is at 40 degrees.

He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Therefore, the temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total cooling effect is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this cooling effect from the temperature after baking:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is:
\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

2. Calculate the distance the horse runs: \( 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for 16 miles. Since the horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay per mile:

3. Calculate the total hay consumed: \( 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \).

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3:

4. Calculate the total cost: \( 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \).

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

5. Calculate the total amount of money Michael has: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we need to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:

6. Calculate the change: \( 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the change Michael has after buying the hay is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out \(\boxed{2}\) trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after his turn in Scrabble. Joey initially has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new scores to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points. 

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all sales is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"First, calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain eight pieces:

Next, calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain sixteen pieces:

\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces per packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:

\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown regular price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option should be $2 more than the cost of the super ticket option.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 15 + x = 21 + 2 \]
\[ 15 + x = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 - 15 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. **Distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:**
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
   \]

5. **Average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies already there, making the total number of fairies \( 50 + 25 = 75 \). Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
45

"First, let's determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he now has:
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is:
   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his current total:
   \[
   210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each 6-inch remora is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw two remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. 

10%"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \( 80 \)."
"To break in the new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week for 3 weeks. First, we calculate the total number of days he will be walking:

Next, we divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book:
\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids to find out how many books each child received. Sarah has 4 kids, so we divide 20 by 4:
\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \boxed{5} books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

1. Let's denote:
   - \( D \) as the number of kids allergic to dairy.
   - \( P \) as the number of kids allergic to peanuts.
   - \( B \) as the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

2. Given:
   - \( D = 9 \)
   - \( P = 6 \)
   - \( B = 3 \)
   - Total number of kids in the class = 32

3. The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is given by:
   \[
   D + P - B = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
   \]

4. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to either dairy or peanuts is:
   \[
   \text{Total kids} - \text{Kids allergic to either or both} = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is \( 20 \)."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
   - Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - Each group has 7 tour guides.
   - Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

3. Calculate the total number of people:
   - Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:

\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes that Jasper has to find the total number of paint tubes:

\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, Jasper has a total of 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[
48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"By 3 pm, Keegan and Tashay had collectively earned $83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tasha) = $174.

Their goal was to raise $200. Therefore, the amount they still need to earn is $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel's player can hold. Since Gabriel's player can hold up to 100 songs and he currently has 20 songs, the number of additional songs he can add is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Now, we calculate how many more songs Luri's player can hold. Since Luri's player can also hold up to 100 songs and she currently has 60 songs, the number of additional songs she can add is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

Final answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find out how much her handbag cost, which is $20 less than $240. So, we subtract $20 from $240:

\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:

\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest temperatures for each country:
   - Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

2. Sum these temperatures:
   \[
   -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
   \]

3. Divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{-30}{3} = -10
   \]

The average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts. Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs cost:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack:
\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many razors Heather gets for $2.00. Since each pack contains 4 razors and she is buying 2 packs (but only paying for 1), she gets:
\[ 4 \text{ razors from the paid pack} + 4 \text{ razors from the free pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is then:
\[ \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid is determined by the height of the topmost person, as they are the highest point.

The height of the human pyramid is therefore 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks \(5 \times 8 = 40\) minutes each day. Over 5 days, she walks \(40 \times 5 = 200\) minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42.

So, Angela's current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Therefore, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

1. **Morning rides:**
   - Cost per morning ride: $6
   - Number of morning rides per day: 1
   - Number of days: 14
   - Total cost for morning rides: \( 6 \times 1 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars

2. **Afternoon rides:**
   - Cost per afternoon ride: $2
   - Number of afternoon rides per day: 1
   - Number of days: 14
   - Total cost for afternoon rides: \( 2 \times 1 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost for morning rides: $84
   - Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
   - Total cost: \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by three to find out how many pies they can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \(L = D + 7\)
2. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)
3. \(L + D + B = 43\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\):
\[B = 2D\]

Now, substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the total equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now, we can find \(L\) using the first relationship:
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]

So, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used. Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn, so:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

To find the total amount of yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[ 273 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her friends based on their requests:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts based on their requests is:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[26\]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and each costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, calculate the total number of legs for Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Given that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost of not having the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, let's verify the number of cows in the zoo:
- If the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, then the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

Next, let's verify the number of sheep on the farm:
- If the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, then the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has \(30\) cows and \(10\) sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is \(30 + 10 = 40\).
- The zoo has \(60\) cows and \(20\) sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is \(60 + 20 = 80\).

Adding the totals from both the farm and the zoo:
- The combined total number of animals is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is 4."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July (up to July 19th): 19 days
   Adding these up:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Gerald has \(\boxed{110}\) dollars left."

Next, calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Water per kilometer} = 2 \, \text{km} \times 60 \, \text{ml/km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for all the bags is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"First, we determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which amount to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which amount to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars}\]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[\boxed{32}\]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

Next, we need to calculate double Rob's time. Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. Therefore, we add 40 minutes to 240 minutes to find out how long Royce takes. 

So, Royce takes \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

**280**"
"First, let's calculate the number of skeins needed for one set of winter wear for a single grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Adding these together for one grandchild:
\[ 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 \text{ skeins} \]

Since Martha is making these for 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:
\[ 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ skeins} \]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes each day.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
4. Add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Loaves returned by the grocery store: 6

First, subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total:
\[ 200 - 93 = 107 \]

Next, subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining loaves:
\[ 107 - 39 = 68 \]

Finally, add the loaves returned by the grocery store to the remaining loaves:
\[ 68 + 6 = 74 \]

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers, we add the number of rows of red tulips to the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows of flowers} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much of the raisins will be allocated to each of the three items: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Since Heather is dividing the raisins equally among the three items, each item will get:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, we can calculate the number of batches by dividing the total amount of raisins for the cookies by the amount needed per batch:

\[
\frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12
\]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Therefore, her new daily consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is still $1.50, so her new weekly cost is:
     \[
     98 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147/\text{week}
     \]

Finally, let's find the difference between the new and old weekly costs.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \$147/\text{week} - \$126/\text{week} = \$21/\text{week}

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy is:

Total money available / Cost per CD = Number of CDs
$48 / $4 = 12

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, which amounts to \(4 \times 8 = 32\) hours. Additionally, he worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which adds up to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours. Lastly, he worked out for 6 hours in one week, adding another 6 hours. 

To find the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we sum these amounts:

\[32 + 10 + 6 = 48\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 48."
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]

2. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, the number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]

4. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]
So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of one monitor. Let the cost of one monitor be \( M \). Then the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \) dollars."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as \( G \).

The problem states that each girl brought \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \) seashells.

So, we calculate:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Each girl brought 300 seashells.

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300."
"First, determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, he originally had:

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188\]

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together gives the total number of vlogs made in the first three weeks:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs."
"First, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

1. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total monthly savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = \$4.50
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

"First, calculate the total earnings for Jairus:
- Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Next, calculate the total earnings for Jenny:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, find the difference in their earnings:
- Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings = $16 - $10 = $6.

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles.

"To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

Thus, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add that to his final weight.

1. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.
2. Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.
3. His final weight is 70 pounds.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered:

1. The cost of the hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20\)
2. The cost of the packs of potato fries: \(10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$3\)
3. The cost of the cans of fruit drinks: \(5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:
\[
\$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33
\]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find out how much change she will get back:
\[
\$50 - \$33 = \$17
\]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill needs for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional \(\boxed{92}\) bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a warm day.

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day. 

On a cold day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a warm day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between a warm day and a cold day is:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a warm day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"First, let's determine the number of buttons with four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons have four holes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 buttons with four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes:

\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes:

\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:

\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

\[ 70 \]"
"First, we determine the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how much coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is \(\boxed{180}\) pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time of Movement**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of the Sun**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Movement} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground is the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   \text{Final Angle} = 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees}

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is **82 degrees**."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the second son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs a number of candles equal to their age, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the candles is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, the reading rate is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using this rate, the number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, we can determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information provided.

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, we can calculate the daily spending amount as follows:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends 4 days. Therefore, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After spending $40, the remaining amount of money is:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week:

- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, the number of roses he lacks each week to supply all the flower shops is:

65 (needed) - 40 (grown) = 25 roses

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 24 months. Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 100 \times 24 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Kate can make is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we'll calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we'll calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we'll add all these costs together to find the total cost:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5. So, \(30 \div 5 = 6\).
4. Next, this value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when she sets it to 450. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) such that the oven will read 520 degrees but actually be 4% higher. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 1.04T = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Adding the 5 minutes gives:
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Adding the durations of both movies together:

"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is. There are 90 pairs in 180 contacts.

"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday: 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday: 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Total calories burned: \(1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

- Water needed: \(\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\)

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- Number of red jelly beans = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After the lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his typing speed by 5 WPM again, his new typing speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \, \text{WPM} \]

Now, we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

The formula for the average is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}} \]

So, the sum of the measurements is:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

The number of measurements is 3. Therefore, the average is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Weight change from eating Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\).

2. **Weight change from eating donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\).

3. **Difference in weight change:**

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Determine how much protein John consumes in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we need to find out how much protein he consumes in a week (7 days):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The additional cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already paid a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \]

George earns \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}

"First, we need to determine the total number of washings provided by the jumbo bottle of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. 

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then each wash uses half the amount of shampoo that 2 pumps would use. Therefore, the number of washings per pump is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each washing costs. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. Since 2 pumps provide 120 washings, the cost per washing is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert the cost per washing to cents:
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Since 1 pump provides 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ washings}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents per washing} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"

   \text{Cost of 20 fish} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10.00
   \]

5. **Fish food:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of fish food} = \$2.00
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$10.00 + \$5.00 + \$6.00 + \$10.00 + \$2.00 = \$33.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Scarlett spent is:
\[
\boxed{33.00}

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of meat Prince will have to sell from the bull. The bull weighs 750kg.

Next, we calculate how much meat Prince sells in a day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell 750kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:
\[ 4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by the students:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ 36 \]"

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ times}
   \]

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ times}
   \]

3. Adding the remaining play times of both DVDs gives:
   \[

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
2. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
3. The cost of the sessions is $125 per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy:
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went twice a week, so each week he spent \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in therapy.
- Over 6 weeks, he spent \(4 \times 6 = 24\) hours in therapy.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(24 \times 125 = 3000\).

So, the total cost of the physical therapy is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and the school day lasts 8 hours, we calculate:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we account for the gum he chews on the way home and after dinner. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's:

\[
1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
\]

Adding the pieces chewed at school, on the way home, and after dinner, we get:

\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Subtracting the 7 pieces he gives to his sister from the 14 pieces he had left, we get:

\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[
\boxed{7}

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach:
- The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each.
- Total cost for basketballs = 8 * $14 = $112.

Now, we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach:
- Difference in spending = Total cost for basketballs - Total cost for baseballs
- Difference = $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Therefore, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. So, for the last four days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week, we get:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Calculate the height difference:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height:
\[ \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost to the company for acquiring these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car.

\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.

\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.
- The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
- The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.

First, calculate the price of the gold Jewell:
\[
\text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver Jewell:
\[
\text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ truck stamps} \]

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \text{ rose stamps} \]

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \]

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:**
   - Distance to be covered: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's determine the cost per class based on the total cost and the number of classes. Manny's total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. The cost per class is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Rearrange the inequality to solve for \( x \):

\[
10x \leq 40
\]

\[
x \leq 4
\]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is the sum of the customers processed by each:
\[50 \text{ (Jewel)} + 100 \text{ (Julie)} = 150 \text{ customers/day}\]

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[150 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week}\]

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges. The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

1. **Clara's Purchase:**
   - Price per pomegranate: $20
   - Number of pomegranates: 20
   - Total cost before voucher: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars
   - Voucher discount: $2
   - Total cost after voucher: \( 400 - 2 = 398 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

2. **Sheila's Purchase:**
   - Price per pomegranate: $30
   - Number of pomegranates: 20
   - Total cost before discount: \( 30 \times 20 = 600 \) dollars
   - Store discount: 10%
   - Discount amount: \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \) dollars
   - Total cost after discount: \( 600 - 60 = 540 \) dollars

Finally, let's find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.

3. **Difference in Prices:**
   - Clara's total cost: $398
   - Sheila's total cost: $540
   - Difference: \( 540 - 398 = 142 \) dollars

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \(\boxed{142}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month were:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he effectively pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the first hour, so each additional hour costs $30.

The total cost is calculated as follows:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

This $220 represents the money she received this week, which includes her wage minus any amount that was withheld. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is:

\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Total dozens of eggs needed = \( \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Lori will need **2 dozens** of eggs."
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental:**
   - James pays $5,000 per month for the hanger.

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\) dollars per month.

Next, we calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental} + \text{Fuel Cost} = 5,000 + 10,000 = 15,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = 15,000 \times 12 = 180,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Cost} + \text{Total Annual Cost} = 150,000 + 180,000 = 330,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \boxed{330000} \]"
"Given:
- Time to cook rice = 30 minutes
- Time to cook pork = Time to cook rice + 20 minutes
- Time to cook beans = 0.5 * (Time to cook pork + Time to cook rice)

First, calculate the time to cook pork:
\[ \text{Time to cook pork} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ \text{Combined cooking time of pork and rice} = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, calculate the time to cook beans:
\[ \text{Time to cook beans} = 0.5 \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, calculate the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = \text{Time to cook rice} + \text{Time to cook pork} + \text{Time to cook beans} \]
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time it took to cook all the food is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
2S + G - S - G = 15
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

\[ \text{Cost increase} = 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the more expensive brand is:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day).

\[ \text{Cost of coffee for a week} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the apple pie cost \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the initial duration of the game is:

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. Therefore, the bamboo needs to grow:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to cover the additional 8 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so there are now \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James had 4 toys.
   - He bought 8 more toys.
   - He then bought 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys James needs is \(4 + 8 + 12 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

"First, let's determine how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow the entire lawn when he uses both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn."

- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the other two triplets.

We know the following:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]
or
\[ T_1 = P_2 + 7 \]
or
\[ T_1 = P_3 + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write:
\[ T_1 + P_1 = 44 \]
or
\[ T_1 + P_2 = 44 \]
or
\[ T_1 + P_3 = 44 \]

Let's assume \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \). Then we can substitute \( P_1 \) in the second equation:
\[ (P_1 + 7) + P_1 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_1 + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_1 = 37 \]
\[ P_1 = 18.5 \]

Now, we can find \( T_1 \):
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{25.5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Now, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the savings of Rong and Neil together, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit per piece:
- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of an apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of a banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).
- There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).
- There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total price for the crate:
\[5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = \$32.0\]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[

2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren), so the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies), so the total number of great-grandbabies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = \(15 \times 20 = 300\).

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display:

- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Fireworks Hannah will see from the city = \(300 \times 0.40 = 120\).

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Finally, let's add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city and the fireworks she will set off in her backyard to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah will see = \(120 + 15 = 135\).

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the following equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 4,800 \text{ pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Let \( x \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Then we have:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 32 + 18 = 50 \]

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."

Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much they raise per hour. From the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger. 

**Final Answer: 14**"
"First, calculate the area that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles, which is two thirds of the 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet.

\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \times 24 \text{ sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

   - Right foot: \(300\) taps per minute
   - Left foot: \(250\) taps per minute
   - Total taps per minute: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps
   - Total taps in 3 minutes: \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps

2. **Calculate taps with arms raised:**
   - Duration: \(2\) minutes
   - Right foot: \(200\) taps per minute
   - Left foot: \(200\) taps per minute
   - Total taps per minute: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps
   - Total taps in 2 minutes: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps

3. **Sum the total taps:**
   - Total taps: \(1650 + 800 = 2450\) taps

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the cost of the city council's fine and the cost of materials to the potential damage to his car.

1. **Cost of the city council's fine for unauthorized road maintenance:**
   \[
   \text{Fine} = \$120
   \]

2. **Cost of materials (3 buckets of asphalt at \$25 each):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of asphalt} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Fine} + \text{Cost of asphalt} = \$120 + \$75 = \$195
   \]

4. **Potential damage to Ron's car:**
   \[
   \text{Damage} = \$450
   \]

5. **Savings by fixing the pothole:**
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Damage} - \text{Total cost} = \$450 - \$195 = \$255
   \]

Therefore, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole."
"The restaurant originally has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. After sending 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs for repair, the number of chairs left can be calculated as follows:

Normal chairs left: \(170 - 20 = 150\)
Baby chairs left: \(23 - 13 = 10\)

Total chairs left: \(150 + 10 = 160\)

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Since there are three people who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of students' cars smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16
\]

Each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:

\[
16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of teachers' cars smashed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24
\]

Each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:

\[
24 \times 2 = 48
\]

Adding the windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars, we get:

\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.

By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

The number of people remaining to vote by midday is:
\[
5000 - 2000 = 3000
\]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
\]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[
3000 - 2000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[
\boxed{1000}

"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Over 30 days, he will need:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, the number of packs he will need is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- The number of sleeves needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

Each person gets $5.

Each of them got $5."
"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each. Since there are two such books, the total weight for these is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: Twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up all the weights:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. This can be calculated as:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine the number of books Steven has:

\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is:

"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. So, the number of birds scared away is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This means the number of birds left after the stone was thrown is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. So, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

**Final Answer: 28**"
"First, we determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students is 80 and there are two classes with an equal number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we calculate the number of girls in each class. Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls, we find 40% of 40:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

This means there are 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"

   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so the final number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8

\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

To find Cal's marbles, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]

Given Sean has 56 marbles:

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) large buttons.

3. **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Large buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60

Total buttons = 27 (small) + 60 (large) + 60 (small) = 147 buttons.

**Final Answer:**

"Last week, Joey played:
- 2 matches on Monday,
- 1 match on Friday,
- and double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:
\[2 + 1 + 4 = 7\]

Therefore, Joey played 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's sum up the number of students for each size:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Adding these together gives the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

"First, calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:
20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Next, find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
50 - 10 = 40 people

Now, calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:
60% of the remaining 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, determine how many people think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16 people

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( P \) be the total number of puppies. Then:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times P = 18
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[
P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

So, Jana has \(\boxed{27}\) puppies."
"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it. So, we calculate half of $90:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the $45 that Ava gave to Jayden to the $70 Jayden already had:

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the $200 camera. We subtract the amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. However, since the problem asks for a final numerical answer, we'll round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \boxed{142.86} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Next, we add the number of pears and bananas to find the total number of fruits:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits."

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Adding the number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:
\[ 600 \]"
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- Her hourly rate is $15, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- For 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Adding her earnings from both days:

- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.

"First, let's break down the problem into parts and solve each step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - The Llesis family drove for a certain number of hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Let \( t_d \) be the time spent driving in hours.
   - The distance driven, \( D_d \), can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     D_d = 50 \times t_d
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - The family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
   - The hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
   - The distance hiked, \( D_h \), can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     D_h = 20 \times 1.5
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     D_h = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent:**
   - The total time spent driving and hiking is 6 hours.
   - Let \( t_d \) be the time spent driving.
   - The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     t_d + 1.5 = 6
     \]
   - Solving for \( t_d \):
     \[
     t_d = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}

"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on. According to the problem, \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects. According to the problem, \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in those 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
Thus, the number of rides in those 2 days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days gives the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, simplify the first equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve these equations by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, solve for \( O \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O + W = 17 \):

\[ O + 4 = 17 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

   - Total amount = \( 200 + 35 = 235 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much Carrie spent.

4. **Amount spent from twenties:**
   - Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties.
   - Total twenties = 10.
   - Amount spent from twenties = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 10 \times 20 = \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

5. **Amount spent from quarters:**
   - Carrie spent all the quarters.
   - Total from quarters = 35 dollars.

6. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Amount spent from twenties + Amount spent from quarters
   - Total amount spent = \( 120 + 35 = 155 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the trip, which is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school will contribute:

\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means the school will contribute $150. Therefore, the remaining cost that John needs to cover is:

\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he has from the remaining cost:

\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. Since she plays for half an hour every day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, we calculate:

\[ \text{Hours in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the following week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:

\[ \text{Hours in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. She picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. She picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. She picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower she picked:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

So, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
2. Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
3. The third friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

- Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters
- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68\]

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:

\[68 \times 0.25 = 17\]

So, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the total amount of ingredients fills a 10-ounce jar. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which represents the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. However, we only need to find \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if we choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number, the equation will hold. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \), is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars Joe gives away or sells is:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time Sandy walked over the two days in hours, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35 \]

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is:

\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. Therefore, the payment for one cycle is:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, the daily earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

\[ \$180.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color of egg together:
\[5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27\]

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total cost of the book and the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 32 + 3.00 = 35.00 \]
\[ \text{Money lost} = 35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has initially is:
\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. The cost for the bag is:
\[ 20 \]

The total amount spent is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ \boxed{14,000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week:

1. **Recording TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours = 120 minutes.

3. **Doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities per week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 120 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 90 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 282 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes per month} \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{1128} \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base 4 mirrors, so the additional cost for mirrors is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base 1 chandelier, so the additional cost for chandeliers is \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base 10 pictures, so the additional cost for pictures is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $224.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of relationships given in the problem.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

**Final answer:**
Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total time for one kangaroo to travel the same distance would also be 18 hours, as they are traveling at the same speed.

The speed of one kangaroo can be calculated as the distance divided by the time. Let's denote the distance of the highway as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). Therefore, we have:
\[ D = S \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

The time \(T\) it takes for one turtle to travel the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} = \frac{D}{\frac{S}{2}} = \frac{D \times 2}{S} = 2 \times \frac{D}{S} = 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since the four turtles are traveling at the same speed and covering the same distance simultaneously, the time it takes for all four turtles to travel the distance is the same as the time it takes for one turtle, which is 36 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the price after the trade-in is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop after receiving help from her mom and her part-time job earnings. This means the total amount of money she currently has, plus the $50 she still needs, should equal the price of the laptop after the trade-in. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 280 = 400 \]

To find the amount of money in her purse, we subtract 280 from 400:

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 400 - 280 = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \]
Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
\[ 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \]
The unused length of the second glue stick is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]
The unused length of the third glue stick is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Adding these unused lengths together gives:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters} \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:
- Car: $10000

Total cost - Total money Gabriel has = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars. The hat cost $70. Therefore, the change Thea received is \(80 - 70 = 10\) dollars.

The change Thea got is $10."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter's socks are \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter's dishes are \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. This is given by:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission time, which is 10 minutes. The total time for one group plus the intermission is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute segments fit into the 120-minute concert duration:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   However, the interest rate should be expressed as a decimal. Therefore:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for one year:**
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. For one year:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 1 = 225
   \]

4. **Calculate the total interest for 3 years:**
   \[
   I_{\text{total}} = I \times t = 225 \times 3 = 675

"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts without collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Adding the remaining goats from both farms together, we get:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:

- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- The discounted price for each basket of red food = \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- Total cost for red food = \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the total costs for both types of baskets to find the overall total:
- Total cost = cost of green food + cost of red food = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is:
123"
"First, calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, determine the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:

\[
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes} \]

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes} \]

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year:
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes} \]

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ 96 \text{ homes} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students and has some extra.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Subtracting this from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
\[ 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} \times 3 \text{ daughters} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

She also gave 3 oranges to her only son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together:

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. Since there are 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, we calculate:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 jello cups, we calculate:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, we find:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back \(\boxed{500}\) dollars in change."
"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays per month is:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost:
\[ 400 \times 0.40 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

This $160 is the total amount Keenan pays per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so the remaining pieces are:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces. Now, let's sum up all the pieces he has eaten:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle for soda and water.

The cost for 7 bottles of soda is $21.00. Therefore, the cost per bottle of soda is:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, each bottle of soda costs $3.00.

The cost for 4 bottles of water is $8.00. Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, each bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide the total earnings by the number of hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles, so he then has:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total, we get:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, Paul has \(\boxed{60}\) marbles left."
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from each type of question.

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - Total questions: 10
   - Correctly answered: 80% of 10 = \(0.80 \times 10 = 8\)
   - Points per question: 1
   - Total points from multiple-choice: \(8 \times 1 = 8\)

2. **True/false questions:**
   - Total questions: 20
   - Correctly answered: 90% of 20 = \(0.90 \times 20 = 18\)
   - Points per question: 1

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these 180 chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens he bought plus the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:

\[
\text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:

\[
\text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{\text{Cost of chickens}}{\text{Number of chickens}} = \frac{7000}{180} = \frac{700}{18} = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89
\]

However, the question asks for the total amount Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, which we have already calculated as $7000.

\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

5"
"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[ \boxed{575} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and we assume she buys a rope of the same length, 20 meters.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope.

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

So, we can write the equation for the final concert as:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes."
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. 

To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

Argo now has 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so she had \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

Each jar contains 10 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Next, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}
\]"
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11v = 121 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \]
So, the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]
So, the speed of a whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the salad is $6.
2. The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods, so the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since Ellen eats two carrots a day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. 

Mark used to make $10 an hour. With a raise of $2 per hour, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns over the two weeks.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he was mowed. Therefore, the total amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \).

The total amount Tasha made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is:
\[ 6 \times 3J + 6 \times 5J = 18J + 30J = 48J \]

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns over the two weeks is:
\[ 48J \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns last month were $80. Let's denote the amount she made from lemonade sales as \( L \). Therefore, we have:
\[ L + 48J = 80 \]

To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to determine the value of \( J \). However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine \( J \) directly. Instead, we can express the amount made from lemonade sales in terms of \( J \):
\[ L = 80 - 48J \]

Since the problem does not give us the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we can infer that the amount made from mowing lawns is a multiple of 48. The only way to satisfy the equation \( L + 48J = 80 \) with \( L \) being a non-negative amount is if \( J = 1 \) (since \( 48 \times 1 = 48 \) and \( 80 - 48 = 32 \)).

So, if \( J = 1 \), then:
\[ L = 80 - 48 \times 1 = 32 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we calculate Christian's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we calculate Harry's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour.

The total hours he rents out the car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Since he gets paid $25 per hour, his total earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500.

So, his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, we determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so we calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed \( 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \) miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is \( 50 + 60 = 110 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance they rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"Susan initially made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

These 96 cookies are to be divided equally among her 6 nephews. So, we divide 96 by 6:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

15"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to find the total amount of soup.

If four adult's bowls are filled, then the total amount of soup is enough for 4 adult bowls.

Now, let's see how much soup is needed for the family's dinner. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have two children. So, the total number of bowls needed for dinner is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ (adult bowls)} + 2 \text{ (child bowls)} = 6 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, we need to convert the remaining soup into child bowls. The total soup is enough for 4 adult bowls, which is equivalent to:
\[ 4 \text{ adult bowls} \times \frac{8 \text{ child bowls}}{4 \text{ adult bowls}} = 8 \text{ child bowls} \]

After the family eats, the remaining soup is:
\[ 8 \text{ child bowls} - 2 \text{ child bowls} = 6 \text{ child bowls} \]

These 6 child bowls of soup can be divided among the two children. Therefore, each child will get:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 3 \text{ child bowls} \]

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times from the leftover soup.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost of the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material per small mask by 20:
     \[
     \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material per large mask by 8:
     \[
     \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total material needed:**
   - To find the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes. After using 3, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate how many red shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Initially, Tim has 9 red shoe boxes. After using 3, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box are 4 and 6, respectively.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, we calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, we subtract the 6 marbles given to Jamie and the 10 marbles given to Donald from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

Together, the two farms have \(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

700"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Therefore, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
     \[
     58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, the number of yellow balloons is:
     \[
     \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}

"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals to \(100 \times 30 = 3000\) miles in a month. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up: \(3000 \div 1000 = 3\).

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\[5 + 10 + 8 = 23\]

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Julia and Nadine bought.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of the balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the ice cream: 2 tubs of ice cream cost $7 each, so the total cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, let's denote the amount each girl had as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount is:
\[
2x = 28

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, then over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"

   - Cost for popcorn: $8
   - Cost for candy: $2
   - Total cost for tonight: \(8 + 2 = 10\) dollars

7. **Remaining budget after tonight:**
   - Remaining budget: \(20 - 10 = 10\) dollars

8. **Cost per movie:**
   - Since it's a Friday, the cost for a movie is $10.

9. **Number of movies Colby can see with the remaining budget:**
   - Number of movies: \(\frac{10}{10} = 1\)

Therefore, Colby can see \(\boxed{1}\) more movie tonight."
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, each mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles.

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of each type of toy:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of these toys from the overall number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

First, substitute the expression for \( Pa \) from the second piece of information into the third piece of information:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( Pa \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100, \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100. \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80. \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ J = 20. \]

Now, substitute \( J = 20 \) back into the expression for \( Pa \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. \]

Finally, substitute \( J = 20 \) into the expression for \( P \):
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

Thus, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person initially received. Maria invited 4 friends, and each friend, including Maria, received 2 water balloons at the start. So, the total number of balloons given at the start is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} + 1 \text{ balloon for Maria} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons to find the total number of balloons:

\[ 9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total number of donated boxes is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

Adding these together, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

- The total number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

Next, calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Now, find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

To find the average total distance spat, divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2):
- Average total distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{\$/widget} = 259,200 \, \text{\$} \]

Revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{\$/widget} = 194,400 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[ 259,200 \, \text{\$} - 194,400 \, \text{\$} = 64,800 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total number of hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional hours are \( 17 - 12 = 5 \) hours.
- The cost for the additional hours is \( 5 \times 70 = 350 \) pesos.

So, the total cost for the 17-hour stay with the additional hourly charge is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 17-hour stay with the additional hourly charge from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information given.

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday.

To find seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from this number to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales:

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo’s age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus’s age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pages per inch**: Since the book is printed such that 100 pages are printed on each side of the paper and the paper is printed on both sides, each inch of thickness corresponds to 200 pages (100 pages per side).

2. **Calculate the total number of pages for the given thickness**: The book is 1.5 inches thick. Therefore, the total number of pages is calculated by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = 200 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:

\[

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Kim Was Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Time Kim Was Awake Before Her Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time from 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Not Asleep:**
   - Total time Kim was not asleep includes the time she was sleepwalking and the time she was awake before her usual wake-up time.
   - Total time not asleep: \(23 + 5 = 28\) minutes.

5. **Time Kim Actually Slept:**
   - Subtract the time she was not asleep from her usual sleep duration.
   - Time Kim slept: \(480 - 28 = 452\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{452}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. With 1/5 of the beds occupied, the number of occupied beds is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. The total number of new admissions over 2 weeks is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

After these admissions, the total number of occupied beds will be:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Thus, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

**Final answer: 100**"
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

The remaining emails, which are not work emails or family emails, are sent to her boyfriend. The number of these emails is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of attendees (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given:

- Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

According to the problem, if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):

\[
2J = 2 \implies J = 1
\]

Now, we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is:

\[
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
\]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

After filling in 2 holes:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there are 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than either of them, Collins got:

\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \text{ corn chips} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they got together is:

\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \text{ corn chips} \]

Adding the number of corn chips Collins got, the total number of corn chips is:

\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:

\[
\boxed{225}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan, \( S \), can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, \( X \), can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ X + S + A = 339 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \), we get:
\[ (4A - 8) + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. Her friends at home had 4 dozen (48) brownies ready for the surprise party.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Total brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 \text{ (made by Greta)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 18 \text{ brownies} \]

Brownies left over:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Nani is 8 years old.

Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ years} \]

So, Nani's sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. **Synthetic Gut Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we sum the total times for each type of stringing:

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (1 for himself, 1 for his wife, and 1 for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is $300 each. So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is:

"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ 120 \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

To find the specific number, we need to know the value of \( x \). The USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the total amount needed by his hourly wage:

$25 ÷ $5/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

5 hours"
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard and Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:

\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries. Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

"First, let's determine the number of boxes Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread on Sunday: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Saturday for apple pie:
- Apple pie on Saturday: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
- Apple pie earnings: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
- Total earnings on Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
- Apple pie earnings: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
- Total earnings on Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. If she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:

\[ 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen, the number of bottles she will need is:

\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The blue car costs $100.

Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of $100:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car costs:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

**Final Answer: 160**"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the spacing are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length by the space each plant needs:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00. So, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- Each basket will also have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. So, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. With 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. With 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is \(3 \div 1 = 3\).

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes each month. Since she sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes, and each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we need to determine how many pairs she can buy each month.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since the peeling and sautering are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the cooling and warming process step by step.

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner running.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then his age when he saw the comet for the first time is \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
52

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Twice as long as Tobias's howl, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: The combined length of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, so \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total combined length of their howls in seconds:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \text{ seconds (Chikote)} + 60 \text{ seconds (Igneous)} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
2. \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information about Helene's age being twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice this average:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The total amount donated by everyone else is $2000. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Next, determine how many cookies were given to the church next door:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies per person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). Therefore, the total size of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours
3. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Let's add up the total time required for each step:
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

Total time required = 120 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 180 minutes

Convert 180 minutes into hours:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, subtract the total time from the serving time (5:00 pm):
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
   - Total cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Daily earnings = Total cost per session * Number of sessions per day
   - Daily earnings = $40 * 3 = $120

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has 4 weeks, and the studio is open 3 days a week, the number of days in a month = 4 * 3 = 12 days
   - Monthly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a month
   - Monthly earnings = $120 * 12 = $1440

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1440."
"First, let's determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes. Since Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[
\text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, we determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes. Since Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[
\text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha. We do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. According to the pool company's instructions, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons of water needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons of water needed} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. Therefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours can be calculated as:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

After 5 hours, the power bank continues to lose 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after the next 3 hours can be calculated as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Now, we multiply these values together:
\[ 0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5018 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.5018 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.5018} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.78%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \(\boxed{55.78\%}\)."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \$10 \]
\[ \text{Hourly tips} = \$15 \]
\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 20\% \times \$10,000 = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$25 \times 40 = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed the sweets equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \( \boxed{139} \) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums are exclusively selfies and 2 albums are exclusively portraits. This means there are:

\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

albums that are either selfies or portraits. Since each of these 5 albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

- 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
- 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests who checked in.
- After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Initial number of guests: 100
2. Guests after early checkout: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
3. Guests after late checkout: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. Guests after afternoon check-in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. Guests after dinner check-in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[4 + 6 + 12 = 22\]

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of remaining questions: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- These remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions.
- Number of average questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
- Number of difficult questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  24 \times 0.75 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ average questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ difficult questions correct}
  \]

Now, we sum up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[
18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats \(\boxed{77}\) sandwiches in one week."

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

This means that the number of eggs left to be found by the friends is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found:

"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. According to the problem, a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.5
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she has:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

yellow balloons left. As she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her clutch of balloons. First, calculate 75% of 8:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her existing balloons. Now, let's sum up all the balloons she has:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension even if the normal teacher doesn't give an extension to the whole class:**
   - Probability = 20% or 0.20

First, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present and does not give an extension to the whole class. This is the complement of the probability that Marcus gets a personal extension in this scenario.

- Probability that Marcus does not get a personal extension = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Next, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present and does not give an extension to the whole class, and the substitute teacher is not present.

- Probability of normal teacher not giving an extension and substitute teacher not being present = (1 - 0.40) * (1 - 0.50) = 0.60 * 0.50 = 0.30

- Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario = 0.30 * 0.80 = 0.24

Now, we add the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework if the substitute teacher is present (which is 50% or 0.50).

- Total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework = 0.50 + 0.24 = 0.74

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

74%"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total amount Melissa is paid for her jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from the total pay to find the net pay:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, calculate the net pay per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place on the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle and then adding 1 (since he starts at the first bottle and places one at the beginning):

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Richard to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he needs to do this 8 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth), the total time is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college:
\[ 50,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After earning his degree, his income tripled:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 3 = 75,000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 100,000 \text{ dollars} \]

After college, Jim's annual income is $75,000. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals:
\[ 200,000 \text{ dollars} + 100,000 \text{ dollars} = 300,000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 at an annual income of $75,000, we divide the total amount by his annual income:
\[ \frac{300,000 \text{ dollars}}{75,000 \text{ dollars/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice the amount delivered on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

Then, on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than this amount:

\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Amount won in the second race = \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

4. **Total Amount Lost:**
   - First race loss = $5.
   - Second race win = $11 (this is a gain, so it reduces the total loss).
   - Third race loss = $16.5.
   - Total loss = \(5 - 11 + 16.5 = 10.5\).

5. **Average Loss:**
   - Total loss over 3 races = $10.5.
   - Number of races = 3.
   - Average loss per race = \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for consistency.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:

"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."

2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the depreciation factor: \(1 - 0.21 = 0.79\).
2. Apply this factor for 3 years: \(20000 \times 0.79^3\).

Now, let's compute \(0.79^3\):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493039 \]

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9861} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
\[ 120 + 20 = 140 \]

At the second stop, 50 people descend and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
\[ 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
\[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package originally $8, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\$2400\)."
"First, we calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, the number of sheets used per year is:
- Twin sheets: \(4 \text{ beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- King sheets: \(1 \text{ bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do for these sheets. The machine can handle:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \text{ twin sheets} \div 2 \text{ sets per load} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \text{ king sheets} \div 1 \text{ set per load} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry:
- \(104 \text{ loads} + 52 \text{ loads} = 156 \text{ loads}\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
156"
"First, let's break down the number of movies watched each day:

- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
- On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Now, to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4:

\[ 6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 4 \text{ weekends} = 24 \text{ movies} \]

Therefore, in 4 weeks, they can watch a total of 24 movies."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, the total number of stickers he had at the beginning of this year is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year. So, the number of stickers he collected this year is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers in his collection now is:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \]

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} + 3 = 10 \]

Solving for Jake's slices:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, we can calculate the number of slices Silvia ate as follows:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia by adding their individual slices together:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each charge:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs:
\[
200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost of the doctor's visit is:

"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
300 \text{ tons}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next half pound at a discount.

To calculate the cost, we need to determine how many full pounds and half pounds he will get with the promotion for 6 pounds of butter.

1. For every 1.5 pounds of butter (1 pound at full price and 0.5 pound at half price), the cost is:
   - Full pound: $4.00
   - Half pound at half price: $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00
   - Total cost for 1.5 pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

2. Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate how many sets of 1.5 pounds he will get:
   - 6 pounds / 1.5 pounds per set = 4 sets

3. The total cost for 4 sets is:
   - 4 sets * $6.00 per set = $24.00

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $24.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Classmates: 25
- Dance class members: 7
- Family members: 13

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will attend is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. The number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee and the additional guest fee gives:

$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]
Solving for Maggie's initial money:
\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]
Solving for Riza's initial money:
\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them spent:
- Maggie spent:
\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]
- Riza spent:
\[
90 - 60 = 30
\]

To find out how much money they have left together, we add the remaining amounts:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this is the daily consumption, the weekly consumption for all three monkeys is:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 168 + 7x\]

We know the total weekly consumption is 315 bananas, so we set up the equation:
\[168 + 7x = 315\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7}\]
\[x = 21\]

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - 5 × 14400 = 72000

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is **72000**."
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Since Binkie's score was 90, we can calculate Frankie's score as follows:

Twice Binkie's score: \(2 \times 90 = 180\)

Frankie's score: \(180 + 15 = 195\)

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles, before realizing he forgot something. He then walked the 2 miles back to the store.

The total distance James walked is:
\[ 2 \text{ miles (to halfway point)} + 2 \text{ miles (back home)} + 2 \text{ miles (to the store)} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Given that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the annual growth rate is:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

The number of bales left in the field is the total number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up:
\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the height to which the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, so the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height to which the ball bounces on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is \(6 \times 12 = 72\) inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is \(72 + 2 = 74\) inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is \(74 - 5 = 69\) inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is \(69 + 3 = 72\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

First, we find the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 10:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"First, calculate the area of the north and south walls:
- Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet.
- Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.

Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls:
- Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet.
- Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, determine how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet:
- Number of gallons needed = \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) gallons.

Finally, calculate the total cost. Since each gallon costs $12:
- Total cost = \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda. The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

So, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days he works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days:
\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:

1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."

"First, let's determine the total population of the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. We can set up the following equation to find the total population (P):

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the school. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples bought is 12 kg. If Pierre and Paul take 7 kg, then the remaining amount for Jacques is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, James will have \(\boxed{5}\) kilograms left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Then, it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:
\[ -6 + 3 = -3 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Raymond initially had $21. He saved an additional $11, so his total amount of money became:

\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. The total amount spent is:

\[ 5 + 19 = 24 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount of money he had:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students this year, we calculate 20% of 50 and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the blinking rate per minute:
\[
\text{Blinking rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We use the blinking rate to set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
\]

Now, perform the division:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate's garden pond has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish:
- He buys 2 more male guppies, so the total number of male guppies becomes \(4 + 2 = 6\).
- He buys 1 more female guppy, so the total number of female guppies becomes \(7 + 1 = 8\).
- He buys 2 more male goldfishes, so the total number of male goldfishes becomes \(3 + 2 = 5\).
- He buys 3 more female goldfishes, so the total number of female goldfishes becomes \(5 + 3 = 8\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: \(6\) (male guppies) + \(5\) (male goldfishes) = \(11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8\) (female guppies) + \(8\) (female goldfishes) = \(16\)

The difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes is:
\[16 - 11 = 5\]

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\) hours."
"First, let's calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents. Since he drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours for one way, the distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since this is a round trip, we need to double this distance:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian walks in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Adding these together, the first four workers produce:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all five workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, we need to determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, and Kris kept 9 for herself. So, Kris originally had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers.
2. These 16 stickers were the result of Luis giving half of what he received to Rob. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half of his stickers. So, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Thus, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we determine the total number of M&M in the 30 ounces:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make \(\boxed{90}\) small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance that is half of the way around the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to cover that distance given his daily flying distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the way around the earth would be:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \text{ mph} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the length of the logs John can make from the tree. The tree is 80 feet long, and he can make logs from 80% of it:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to determine how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each group of trees.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the final tree, which had 3 blue birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we sum all these numbers together:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of these marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces.

The formula for the weighted average temperature is:
\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts. 

\[
\boxed{68}

"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over this period and then sum them with the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 days = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of scoops per potato:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be interpreted as \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of scoops per potato is \( \frac{2 \text{ scoops}}{3 \text{ potatoes}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ scoops per potato} \).

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If \( \frac{2}{3} \) scoops are made from 1 potato, then for 18 scoops, the number of potatoes required is:
   \[
   \frac{18 \text{ scoops}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ scoops per potato}} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans. Since there are 17 green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Next, calculate the number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years):
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from individual sales + Sunflowers from bouquets = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue:

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, the probability of winning for the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots during the weekdays.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots during the weekend.

Adding the carrots eaten during the weekdays and the weekend, Mason eats a total of \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots a week.

"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to get the total length of the cassette:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned's height is:

\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find Carl's height. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need to produce 5 bottles of juice (since \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \)).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 bow-wearers, 2 are purple-wearers. Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tax reports received over the week.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining total.

Let's start with the total number of tax reports received over the week:
\[ 5168 \]

Next, subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Then, subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

The price for this land was $50. So, the remaining land after the first sale is:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his remaining land. The amount of land sold in the second transaction is:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

The price for this land was $30. So, the remaining land after the second sale is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

Abraham then sold the remaining 30 square meters of land for $3 per square meter. The money earned from this sale is:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money earned from the three sales:

\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[ \boxed{170} \]"
"First, we need to find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, we need to find Geb's age, which is 10 less than half of Haley's age. So, we subtract 10 from 13:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old. 

Geb's age is 3."

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

\[ \text{Total amount Jack has now} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation:
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify and solve for \( Y \):
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, so we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum these values.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]

This means the number of bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
- Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, summing up the goals:
- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals.
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Day 1 (Tuesday): 
     - Remaining chalk = 2.75 inches - (20% of 2.75 inches) = 2.75 inches - (0.20 * 2.75 inches) = 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.20 inches.
   - Day 2 (Wednesday):
     - Remaining chalk = 2.20 inches - (20% of 2.20 inches) = 2.20 inches - (0.20 * 2.20 inches) = 2.20 inches - 0.44 inches = 1.76 inches.
   - Day 3 (Thursday):
     - Remaining chalk = 1.76 inches - (20% of 1.76 inches) = 1.76 inches - (0.20 * 1.76 inches) = 1.76 inches - 0.352 inches = 1.408 inches.
   - Day 4 (Friday):
     - Remaining chalk = 1.408 inches - (20% of 1.408 inches) = 1.408 inches - (0.20 * 1.408 inches) = 1.408 inches - 0.2816 inches = 1.1264 inches.
   - Day 5 (Saturday):
     - Remaining chalk = 1.1264 inches - (20% of 1.1264 inches) = 1.1264 inches - (0.20 * 1.1264 inches) = 1.1264 inches - 0.22528 inches = 0.90112 inches.

4. **Determine when the chalk needs to be recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - On Saturday, the remaining chalk is 0.90112 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"First, let's determine the number of teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so if he drills 4 teeth, he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This includes both the teeth that were drilled and the teeth that were capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\) teeth.

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[
\left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount based on the price per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by moving all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with his total budget.

The total number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob distributes this total number of books equally among 3 schools. Therefore, the number of books per school is:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one back into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one back at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out.
4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples step by step:

- Initially, 2 apples fell out.
- Newton put 1 in his pocket and threw 1 back, causing 5 more to fall out. So, he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground, making a total of 6 apples.
- Newton picked up 4 of these 5 apples (leaving 1 on the ground) and put them in his pocket, throwing the remaining one back, which caused 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground, making a total of 11 apples.
- Newton picked up all 6 apples on the ground, adding them to the 5 he already had in his pocket, making a total of 11 apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 11.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices they will eat:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required:

For the cheese pizza:
Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pie}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pie}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, for these three days, the total is \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, the total is \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Adding these totals together gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\]

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour (60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4).
   - Therefore, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Net rate = Rate of building - Rate of melting
   - Net rate = 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs/hour.

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of accumulation.
   - Time = Total snowballs needed / Net rate
   - Time = 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information provided.

1. Let's denote John's current age as \( J \) and Jim's current age as \( M \).
2. We know that John is currently 28 years old, so \( J = 28 \).
3. We also know that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. So, 20 years ago, John's age was \( J - 20 \) and Jim's age was \( M - 20 \).
4. According to the problem, \( J - 20 = 2 \times (M - 20) \).

Now, substitute \( J = 28 \) into the equation:
\[ 28 - 20 = 2 \times (M - 20) \]
\[ 8 = 2 \times (M - 20) \]
\[ 8 = 2M - 40 \]
\[ 8 + 40 = 2M \]
\[ 48 = 2M \]
\[ M = \frac{48}{2} \]
\[ M = 24 \]

So, Jim is currently 24 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Jim is 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since the number of bandages cannot be negative, this means they ran out of bandages and needed to order more. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and the usage for the day, so they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and the usage for the second day.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 + 16 - 28 = 0\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages used: Half a pack = \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(0 + 100 - 25 = 75\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 3 more bandages at the beginning of the third day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(75 - 3 = 75\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once, earning $3.00.
2. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once, earning $1.50.
3. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason took the trash out twice, earning $0.75 each time. So, for two times, he earned \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
4. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, earning $0.50 each time. So, for six times, he earned \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50 people) had entered the restaurant. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered by evening.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. The problem states that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\).

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. This leaves us with:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
- Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Next, let's account for the colors stolen and used up:

- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors: \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors: \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors used, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors left from that set.
- The total number of colors from the remaining makeup sets is \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors (since one set now has 3 colors left and the other two sets are untouched).

Finally, we add the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets:

- Remaining colors from the palettes: \(4 + 4 = 8\) (since one palette is stolen, she has one left with 4 colors).
- Remaining colors from the makeup sets: \(15\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(8 + 15 = 23\).

**Final Answer: 23**"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \).
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \).

The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs based on the average:
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in a day is \( 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is \(\boxed{40000}\)."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Last tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, they threw:

\[ 288 \text{ balloons} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi needs for one dose. Since the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, we add the amounts of both medicines to find the total amount of medicine for one dose:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:

\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's school is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Maximum number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Given that 30% of the jelly beans are red, the maximum number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Maximum number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

However, the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. Tim's guess was 864, so the difference between his guess and the true number is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim was \(\boxed{36}\) red jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people on the bus cannot exceed 200. Therefore, the bus is full, and no more people can enter.

**Final numerical answer**:
The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(0\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made to the museum over the 8 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she made:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

For the next 3 years, she continued to visit 3 times a year:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

So, the total number of visits over 8 years is:
\[ 15 \text{ visits} + 9 \text{ visits} = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The initial cost of one visit is $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars} + (150\% \times 2 \text{ dollars}) = 2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on all 24 visits at the new cost:
\[ 24 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of students who can try the escape room. There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who qualify, making a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:

\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. 

The cost for the wooden tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

The cost for the roof frames is:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
$80 + $20 = $100

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - He needs 5 pounds of ground beef.
   - Therefore, the amount of secret seasoning needed is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, the total width is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the total cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - Each minute costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 16 minutes = \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The call duration is 36 minutes, so the remaining minutes after the first 16 minutes = \( 36 - 16 = 20 \) minutes.
   - Each of these minutes costs $0.20.
   - Total cost for 20 minutes = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is **$8**."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. 

On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice Monday's total. 

Twice Monday's total is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches. 

Adding 1 more inch to this gives \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

Therefore, the expected rainfall on Tuesday is 5 inches.

5 inches"
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( b \) from above:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the discount:

- Basic manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40

Total cost before discount: $35 + $40 = $75

20% off for both services:
- Discount amount: $75 * 20% = $75 * 0.20 = $15

Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Next, calculate the cost of adding nail art on each of her fingers. Assuming Karen has 10 nails on each hand (5 on each hand), she would have 20 nails in total.

Cost of nail art per nail: $3
Total cost for nail art: 20 nails * $3 = $60

Finally, add the cost of the discounted services and the nail art:

Total cost: $60 (discounted services) + $60 (nail art) = $120

Karen would pay a total of $120."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each.
2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

Now, let's calculate the total number of issues from each type of magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Next, we add up all the issues from each magazine to find the total number of magazines she gets every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the total number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

1. 3 magazines that send 12 issues each.
2. 1 magazine that sends 6 issues.
3. 1 magazine that sends 24 issues.

So, the total number of magazines is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings.

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's number of paintings.

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was priced at $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{New price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:

\[ 100\% - 25\% = 75\% \]
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars."

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"Let's denote the number of novels Regina wrote this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she wrote this year. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x = 9
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. Assuming he drives for 24 hours each day (excluding stops), the distance he covers each day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes and there are 4 pies, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to find the total number of grapes used:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

1. Total number of teachers: 82
2. Number of sick teachers: 13
3. Number of substitute teachers: 9

First, subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Then, add the number of substitute teachers to the result:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78."
"First, let's break down the costs for one week of making macaroni and cheese:

1. **Pasta cost**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cheddar cheese cost**: $3.00.
3. **Gruyere cheese cost**: Twice the amount spent on cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's add up the total cost for one week:
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Pasta cost} + \text{Cheddar cheese cost} + \text{Gruyere cheese cost} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe.

To find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) and the total time available in a day (480 minutes):

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

However, since the custodian only has 480 minutes available each day, the correct calculation should be:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{2400} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 0.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Now, we need to find out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books:

- Since one bookcase can hold 55 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer:**
2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at $1/3 per egg is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price of a bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions across both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we determine how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes, which is \( 5S - 4 \):
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. Therefore, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party:
- John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
- Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

Next, determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy:
- John already has 4 hot dogs left over.
- Hot dogs needed to buy = 40 total hot dogs - 4 hot dogs already available = 36 hot dogs.

Now, calculate how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy:
- Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
- Packs needed = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.

Finally, calculate the total cost:
- Each pack costs $2.
- Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

"To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's perform the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Next, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is:
1,218"

"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes of meditation per day. Over 4 weeks, assuming she practices every day, she spends:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 840 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, she practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. Over 4 weeks, this amounts to:

\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Converting the yoga practice time into minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on meditation and yoga:

\[ 840 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 2040 \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of pens Sarah has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36 inches tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height is:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:
\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. To find out how tall Jackie was before the summer, we subtract the 3 inches from her current height:
\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was \(\boxed{67}\) inches tall before the summer."

"First, let's determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half that distance:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's running speed. Since Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:

\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:

\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = 2 \times \text{Aaron's speed} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using Vanessa's speed, we can calculate the time it took her to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 32 when his son James was born, and James is currently 18, John is currently \(32 + 18 = 50\) years old.

The question asks how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. Since the youngest son was born when John was 32, and John is currently 50, the youngest son is currently \(50 - 32 = 18\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs $80 after the discount.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

To find out how many slices each person can have, divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
