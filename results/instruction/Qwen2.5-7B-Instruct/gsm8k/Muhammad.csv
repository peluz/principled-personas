"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market every day is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, which means the value is now 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% is 1.5, and 100% is 1, so 1.5 + 1 = 2.5).

New value of the house = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Next, we calculate the total cost of the project, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost.

Total cost = $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repair cost) = $130,000

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

Profit = New value of the house - Total cost = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can calculate it as follows:

1. Distance per sprint: 60 meters
2. Number of sprints per session: 3
3. Number of sessions per week: 3

Total distance per week = Distance per sprint × Number of sprints per session × Number of sessions per week

Total distance per week = 60 meters × 3 × 3

Total distance per week = 180 × 3

Total distance per week = 540 meters

So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. Let's start with the number of sheep in Seattle, which is given as 20.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:

\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update installation.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for Windows update installation:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in standstill - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first leg + Distance of return journey = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the total distance he has traveled (315 miles) is the distance from his current position to home.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate her earnings:

- Earnings from regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Earnings from overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- Cost to plant the tree: $90 (one-time cost)
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3

Next, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Number of lemons grown per year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5

Annual revenue = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
- Number of years to cover initial cost = Initial cost / Net profit per year
- Number of years to cover initial cost = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Contemporary Dance Enrollment:**
   - 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
   - \(20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4\) students.

2. **Remaining Students:**
   - After 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, the remaining students are \(20 - 4 = 16\).

3. **Jazz Dance Enrollment:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.
   - \(25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4\) students.

4. **Hip-Hop Dance Enrollment:**
   - The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
   - Remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance: \(16 - 4 = 12\) students.

5. **Percentage of Hip-Hop Dance Enrollment:**
   - To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{12}{20}\right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry: $125
- Electronic Gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125 at the end of the month.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

If she makes 3 egg omelets every day, then in 28 days, she will have made 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 84 / 12 = 7 dozens.

7 dozens"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to cover the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time already spent on the first 6 miles.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to cover the last 6 miles.
4. Find the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time already spent on the first 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The remaining time to cover the last 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink before and after the spill, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water spilled:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a liter of water.
   - Amount of water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters ≈ 0.67 liters.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters:**

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the difference between Samantha's current age and the age of Raymond's son when he was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is currently 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son is currently 25 - 23 = 2 years old.

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the current age of Raymond's son from Samantha's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond's son is 2, the son was born 31 - 2 = 29 years ago.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. If the final price Kyle paid is $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
3. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Shorts:**
   - Number of pairs: 3

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. Therefore, he stopped at mile 60 - 15 = mile 45.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile he stopped at first from the mile he stopped at second:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total age to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen, and then calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total of their ages is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average.

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To calculate the total hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on one dog.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. John has 10 dogs, so the daily hours spent on all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us two equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20 jewels. Therefore, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

2. Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \] points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Total points scored by Mike:
9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165, the number of lego sets he still has is the original number of lego sets minus the number of lego sets he sold, which is 0 because he sold all of them. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \]

Final numerical answer:
0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - We need to know his speed to calculate the distance, but since we don't have that information, we'll assume he runs at a constant speed throughout the week.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - John runs half as much as the first day on the other two days.
   - If he runs 3 hours on the first day, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours on each of the other two days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   - Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours of running time.

4. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.

5. **Average speed:**
   - Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.
   - Total time = 6 hours
   - Total distance = 60 miles
   - Average speed = \( \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \).

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed \(\times\) Time
   - Distance running = \(6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = \(1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6\) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
   - Total distance = \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles."
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:

"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since a 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories by setting up a proportion.
   - The proportion is \( \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{300 \times 200}{1250} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \) grams.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips with your remaining daily calorie target."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candles made.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Calculate the total cost of supplies.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles made.
Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax. If he makes 20 candles, we can determine the amount of beeswax used:
\[ \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
Each candle is sold for $2.00, so for 20 candles:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of supplies.
The cost for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. For 2 pounds:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00."
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to first determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
- Total hours = 26 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

So, the calculation would be:

80 (initial notes) - 220 (used at work) - 23 (remaining) = -163

This negative result indicates that Candice used more notes than she initially had, which means the package she purchased must have contained more than the 220 notes she used at work plus the 23 notes she had left. To find out how many notes were in the package, we need to add the 220 used and the 23 remaining to the initial 80 notes:

80 (initial notes) + 220 (used at work) + 23 (remaining) = 323

Therefore, the package Candice purchased contained 323 Post-it notes."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can obtain:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to find the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to find the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to travel back.

If we assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles, then:

1. The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, and the speed is 10 miles per hour. So, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. On the return trip, the speed is 6 miles per hour. The time taken to travel back can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To calculate the revenue for each day, we need to multiply the number of tires repaired by the respective rate for each type of tire.

On Thursday:
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday:
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's ($480), we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue to find the difference.

$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens born to their house cats.

First, we know that the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

Next, we are told that Patchy, one of the house cats, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the number of adopted kittens is 7, thrice that number is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

We are also told that Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens born to the house cats:
\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
40"
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are:

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:

28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this amount with his $42. We do this by dividing his total money by the cost of one trip:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the available weight for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how much Janet paid in total, we need to add the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the cost of insurance.

1. The cost of the material is $500.
2. The cost of construction is $800.
3. The cost of insurance is 10% of the total cost of material and construction.

First, we calculate the total cost of material and construction:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate 10% of $1300 for the insurance:
\[ 10\% \times 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of material and construction:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the standard pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension she receives after 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension is:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this increased pension for the remaining 10 years of her service. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays the full monthly rate of $140 for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than the full monthly rate for 6 months.

First, let's calculate the amount for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{First half payment} = 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we calculate the reduced monthly rate for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly rate} = 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]

Now, we calculate the amount for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Second half payment} = 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total payment for the year:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ 1596 \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the fuel efficiency we calculated:

\[ \text{Miles on a Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also has 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we add up all the gems:
- Diamonds: 175
- Rubies: 140
- Emeralds: 280

Total number of gems = \(175 + 140 + 280 = 595\).

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"Given that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, to find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls together:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days.
- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

So, the total number of classes in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} + 8 \text{ classes} = 25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students in a week is:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is:
\[ 495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7425.00 \]"
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

To prepare the two dishes, Kelian has to read the instructions for both recipes, which totals \(20 + 40 = 60\) instructions.

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items to find the overall amount raised:
- Total amount raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each.
Total cost = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
The interest rate is 2% per unit, and there are 5 units.
Total interest = 5 * $150 * 2% = $150 * 0.02 * 5 = $15

Step 3: Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
Final amount = Total cost + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16 square feet.

Let's denote the square footage of each level from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
- Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
- Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
- Level 4 (bottom): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we can calculate the total square footage of the sandcastle by summing the square footage of all levels:
\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

Since there are 4 levels, the average square footage of a level is the total square footage divided by the number of levels:
\[\frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then consider that the question asks specifically about the first year. Since a year is typically considered to be 365 days, we can calculate the amount of food needed for the remaining days after the first 180 days.

1. For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining days of the year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days is:
   \[
   185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Adding the amounts from the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days, the total amount of dog food needed in the first year is:
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
   \[
   \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}
   \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying in packages of 2 - Cost of buying in packages of 3
- Savings = $9.00 - $15.00 = -$6.00 (This negative value indicates an error in the comparison, as we should be looking at the positive savings from the cheaper option)

Revisiting the calculation, we see that the correct comparison should be:
- Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the final cost after the discount, we first need to find out how much the 30% discount is on the $100 grooming cost.

30% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the final cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

So, Charlie has 0 stickers left."
"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is \(75 \times 8 = 600\).

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang over the three instances.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up the total number of times the alarm rang:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary after each of the next three years, given the 10% annual increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for 5 years.

The formula to calculate the salary after a certain number of years with a fixed percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Final Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Final Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Final Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Final Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Final Salary after 5 years} = 966.306 \]

So, after 5 years, her monthly salary is approximately $966.31.

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after each of the next three years.**

Now, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years, with a 10% increase each year.

For the first year after 5 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 966.31 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 1062.941 \]

For the second year after 5 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1062.941 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1169.2351 \]

For the third year after 5 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1169.2351 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1286.15861 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, her annual salary after three more years of service is approximately $1286.16.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{1286.16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of friends who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for 9 gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by the adults and the children.

1. Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
2. Each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children:

- For the adults: \(20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}\)
- For the children: \(5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}\)

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%.

First, we know that Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can find Gerald's original time by adding those two seconds to Lee's current time:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster than his original time. To find the new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:

\[ \text{Improvement in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{10}{100} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, 2/5 of the students are boys. So, the number of boys is:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"Harry slept 9 hours.

James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, so we calculate James's sleep as follows:

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and this is after the tomatoes have lost half their volume during cooking. This means that the volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes before cooking was:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit, so we subtract these from the original number:
   30 - 5 = 25 cars remain in the traffic jam.
3. We know that 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that remained minus the number that drove through in the last 15 minutes:
   25 - 20 = 5 cars.

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has before receiving the new ones is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses of water

Adding the weekday and weekend water consumption together:
20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses of water

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given about the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

140 minutes"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pieces**: 1000 pieces.

2. **Poppy places a quarter of the pieces**:
   - A quarter of 1000 is \( \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \) pieces.
   - After Poppy places her pieces, there are \( 1000 - 250 = 750 \) pieces left.

3. **Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces**:
   - A third of 750 is \( \frac{750}{3} = 250 \) pieces.
   - After her mom places her pieces, there are \( 750 - 250 = 500 \) pieces left.

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is **500**."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and then isolate the Wednesday viewing.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 0.5 \, \text{hour} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 5.5 \, \text{hours}\)

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 \, \text{hours} - 5.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5.

- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \, \text{hours} \div 0.5 \, \text{hours/episode} = 3 \, \text{episodes}\)

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year."
"To calculate the final cost of the gas after the cashback reward, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, after the cashback rewards, the gas will cost:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up sheet they had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate:
- Total = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups
- Total = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total by 2 (since there are two of them):
- Average = Total / 2
- Average = 90 / 2 = 45

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can calculate the rate at which she rows in feet per second:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. There are 4 teachers.
3. Each lesson requires the whiteboard to be cleaned 3 times.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days. So, the total number of flowers planted is:

2 flowers/day × 15 days = 30 flowers

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. This is 6 times the capacity of Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
   - Let the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph be \( D \).
   - Then, \( 300 = 50D \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[10 \times 10 = 100\]
- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[5 \times 16 = 80\]
- Therefore, the total cost is:
  \[100 + 80 = 180\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $10.
  \[10 + (10 \times 0.5) = 10 + 5 = 15\]
  \[10 \times 15 = 150\]
- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $16.
  \[16 + (16 \times 0.5) = 16 + 8 = 24\]
  \[5 \times 24 = 120\]
- Therefore, the total revenue is:
  \[150 + 120 = 270\]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[270 - 180 = 90\]

Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes John buys: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day was:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago
Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

\[ 40,000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40,000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30,769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later
Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40,000 + 16,000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56,000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later
Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien's salary increased by 40%, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43,076.92 \]

### Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.

First, calculate the number of sheets he uses in a week:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Now, to find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we need to assume a month has approximately 4 weeks (since 52 weeks in a year divided by 12 months is about 4.33 weeks per month, we can round to 4 for simplicity).

So, the number of sheets he uses in a month is:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought, which is:
2 * 5 = 10 apples.

Kael also brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought, which is:
8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they have:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 + 14 = 27 fruits

Therefore, they have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 46 hours

"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, the distance she covers in the first 3 hours is:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the distance she covers in the next 4 hours is:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of her run gives the total distance:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 

One-third of 60 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can find out how many were there initially by subtracting the 20 newly-stamped letters from the current total.

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends."
"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**The total amount of money he will spend is $880.**"
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit, so we subtract 20 from the initial 60:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   Now, there are 40 elves left.
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 remaining elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the final number of elves left is 30."
"Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

To find the total expenditure for May and June, we add the two amounts together:

$500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for those two months was $940."
"Pam and Fred each rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

For the roller coaster:
- Pam rode 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Fred rode 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.

For the luge:
- Both Pam and Fred rode 2 times each, so together they used \(2 \times 6 + 2 \times 6 = 12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Adding the tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge:
- Total tickets used = \(12 + 24 + 24 = 60\).

Therefore, they used 60 tickets that day."
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\(41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

Step 1: Monthly cost of car washes
Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15.
So, the monthly cost is \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.

Step 2: Annual cost
There are 12 months in a year, so the annual cost is \(60 \times 12 = 720\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has:

20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has and then subtract 5:

3 * 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 video games.

Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:
   \[

Questions completed in the first test = 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Questions completed in the second test = Rate × Time available
Questions completed in the second test = 5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we calculate the number of questions left incomplete for each test:

In the first test:
Questions left incomplete = Total questions - Questions completed
Questions left incomplete = 75 - 40 = 35 questions

In the second test:
Questions left incomplete = Total questions - Questions completed
Questions left incomplete = 100 - 30 = 70 questions

To find the total number of questions left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:

Total questions left incomplete = Questions left incomplete in the first test + Questions left incomplete in the second test
Total questions left incomplete = 35 + 70 = 105 questions

Final numerical answer:
105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( B = 12 \) (the number of blue gumballs)
- \( P = 4B + 22 \) (there are 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs)

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( P \):

\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ \frac{4B}{2} + \frac{2B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Solving for B:
\[ 7B = 1400 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Now, using the relationship \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

Step 1: Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Step 2: Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked 14 hours in a week, he would earn:
\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"To determine the total cost, we first need to identify which items are non-food items and then calculate the tax on those items. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The food items are milk and eggs.

1. Calculate the total cost of non-food items:
   - Light bulbs: $3
   - Cups: $3
   - Roach traps: $4
   Total non-food items cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

2. Calculate the 10% tax on non-food items:
   - 10% of $10 = $1

3. Calculate the total cost of food items:
   - Milk: $2
   - Eggs: $3
   Total food items cost: $2 + $3 = $5

4. Add the tax to the total cost of non-food items and the total cost of food items:
   - Total cost = $5 (food) + $10 (non-food) + $1 (tax) = $16

The final numerical answer is:
$16"
"Kim has a total of 3 existing clients plus 5 potential clients, which makes 8 clients in total.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 clients, he will need:
- 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach/client = 16 bottles of bleach
- 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths/client = 8 packs of cloths

The cost for the supplies will be:
- 16 bottles of bleach * $2/bottle = $32
- 8 packs of cloths * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses for the week will be:
- $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
John has 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
Since John can harvest every 3 months, in a year (which has 12 months), he can make:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. Let's calculate the total number of Lego pieces:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half as many bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. This means all 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours plus the 60 bees that left in the next 6 hours, totaling \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees.

So, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

Final numerical answer:
90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost of 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has first, and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

1. Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

2. According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]

3. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

4. The problem also states that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of friends James has is:
   \[
   4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

Time for Steve to get home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Steve}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Steve}}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute

Time for Tim to get home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Tim}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Tim}}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in their times:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, we get 500 cents / 100 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day."
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before ants carried off the final fry**: There were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
3. **Before the raccoon took two-thirds**: The raccoon took two-thirds, so the remaining one-third was 6 fries. Therefore, the number of fries before the raccoon took them was 6 * 3 = 18 fries.
4. **Before the pigeons ate**: Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 7 fries (half of 14). Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.
6. **Before Dave ate 14 fries**: Dave ate 14 fries, so the original number of fries in the pack was 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
48"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- This totals to 3 classes * 1 hour/class * 3 days = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- This totals to 2 classes * 2 hours/class * 2 days = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours for the entire week:
- Total hours per week = 9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TuTh) = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly total by 16:
- Total hours in one semester = 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Total length of baguettes in feet: \(60 \times 2 = 120\) feet.

Now, we need to convert the lengths of rolls and croissants to feet to add them to the length of the baguettes. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Total length of rolls in feet: \(\frac{1200}{12} = 100\) feet.
- Total length of croissants in feet: \(\frac{720}{12} = 60\) feet.

Adding all these lengths together:

- Total length in feet: \(100 + 60 + 120 = 280\) feet.

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
2. Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
3. Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Now, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for one month:

\[ \text{Total bananas per month} = 200 (\text{monkeys}) + 400 (\text{gorillas}) + 100 (\text{baboons}) = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to double the monthly requirement:

\[ \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is \(100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}\).
- Therefore, Blake runs a total of \(200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is \(40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}\) per round trip.
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, Kelly runs a total of \(80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}\).

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances they run:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.
- The difference is \(3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards}\).

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."

1. The cost of the pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
2. The cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
3. The cost of the bond paper: $20

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:

$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to consider the following:

- Initially, all 11 tadpoles are visible.
- 6 tadpoles come out from hiding, so the number of visible tadpoles increases by 6.
- 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of visible tadpoles decreases by 2.

So, the calculation is:
11 (initially visible) + 6 (came out) - 2 (hid) = 15

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by both and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\)

Next, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we add these totals together to find the total number of fish caught:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, each increase adds $4 to the price. After 18 increases, the total increase in price is:

\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase:

\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 92 \]"
"Given the information:

1. One red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. An action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- There are 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- There are 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The doll costs $15.

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(35 \times 3 = 105\) dollars.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - If she hires the accountant, she spends $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in potential income.

4. Calculate the difference:
   - The difference is \(105 - 90 = 15\) dollars.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102

Now, let's do the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423
4. €1423 + €74 = €1497
5. €1497 + €102 = €1599

The total cost of the items is €1599. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €99.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

€0

She will be €99 over her budget."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs required by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ 45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs/babysitting} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Adding $2 to that amount gives us \(16 + 2 = 18\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day, which is 2 days.

So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles

And the total miles he walks on the weekend is:
10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles

Adding these together gives the total miles he walks in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

3. For the rare mutant invertebrates:
   - There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = 640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (rare mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- The age of the fourth bird (Caboose) is not given, so we assume it is the same as Sally Thirtytwo, which is 8 years old.

Adding these ages together:

\[19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\]

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts each month, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more of that amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   So, 50% more than the minimum monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total amount paid in a year:
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total amount paid in a year = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for peeling and cutting each potato, and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time taken to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time taken to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, let's convert the peeling time into seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes:
- 90 seconds per potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

Next, we calculate the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes:
- 5 seconds per potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Finally, we add the total peeling time and the total cutting time to get the overall prep time:
- 5400 seconds (peeling) + 300 seconds (cutting) = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time back into minutes:
- 5700 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

95 minutes"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon of lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Determine the profit per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons they sold:**
   - They made a total profit of $25
   - Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Determine the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons: Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.
7. The final amount will be the remaining money after all these expenses and donations.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - (1500 + 2000) = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after the donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to his daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final amount remaining**:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have \(\boxed{350}\) dollars."
"Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{\text{Number of pink calla lilies}}{5} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find out how many red roses she ordered. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{Number of white carnations} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
4. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.
5. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
6. Since two years have passed, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
7. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time - the less well-rounded team's total time = 220 seconds - 222 seconds = -2 seconds.

Since the result is negative, it means the faster team actually wins by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples. Therefore, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

They both picked a total of 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total to find the pieces given to the rats.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of rats is \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) rats.
   - Since these 15 rats are distributed equally among 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

Let's break it down month by month:

1. **After the first month:**
   - Initial amount: $100
   - Interest for the first month: $100 * 2% = $2
   - Total amount after the first month: $100 + $2 = $102

2. **After the second month:**
   - Amount at the start of the second month: $102
   - Interest for the second month: $102 * 2% = $2.04
   - Total amount after the second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

3. **After the third month:**
   - Amount at the start of the third month: $104.04
   - Interest for the third month: $104.04 * 2% = $2.0808
   - Total amount after the third month: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

Final numerical answer:

   - Cost of transportation per bag: $2
   - Total cost per bag: $20 + $2 = $22

2. **Calculate the total revenue per bag:**
   - Selling price per bag: $30

3. **Determine the profit per bag:**
   - Profit per bag: Selling price - Total cost per bag = $30 - $22 = $8

4. **Calculate the total number of bags sold:**
   - Total profit: $400
   - Profit per bag: $8
   - Number of bags sold: Total profit / Profit per bag = $400 / $8 = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ 34 \]

Each of them paid $34."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks.
Total weekly need = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

Step 2: Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.
Daily need = Total weekly need / 7 days/week = 35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 91 trees left."

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's sum up all the cards she has:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200
Total cards = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."

2. Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

Step 1: Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
- Josie has 10 acres.
- Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Step 2: Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.
- Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.
- Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese consumption for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches = 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total cheese for omelets = 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinners:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up all the cheese used:

"Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. She then bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens contained 9 pens, and each bag of red pens contained 6 pens.

First, we calculate the total number of blue pens:
6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, we calculate the total number of red pens:
2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, we add all the pens together:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

So, Janet has a total of 98 pens now."
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 5 tests (since the lowest score will be dropped).
2. Determine the sum of the scores she has already achieved.
3. Calculate the score she needs on the sixth test to reach the required sum after dropping the lowest score.

First, let's calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 5 tests. The formula for the average is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

To get an average of 93 over 5 tests, the sum of the 5 scores must be:

\[ 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

Next, we calculate the sum of the scores Brinley has already achieved:

\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Now, we need to determine the lowest score among the five tests. The lowest score is 71. If we drop this score, the sum of the remaining four scores must be:

\[ 465 - 71 = 394 \]

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The sum of the four highest scores plus \( x \) should equal 394:

\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x = 394 \]

However, we only need the sum of the four highest scores plus \( x \) to equal 394, so:

\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + x = 394 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 281 + x = 394 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 394 - 281 \]
\[ x = 113 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 113 on her sixth test to get an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 \, \text{g} = 1000 \, \text{g} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40 \, \text{g}}{2} = 20 \, \text{g} \]

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 \, \text{g} = 1600 \, \text{g} \]

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 \, \text{g} + 1600 \, \text{g} = 2600 \, \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ 2600 \, \text{g} \]"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(34800 \div 20 = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(1740 \div 12 = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the following equation:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 70 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (perimeter of the park) and the speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she promised to return, which includes the original amount plus 10% of that amount.

1. Calculate the total amount to be returned:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \$2000 + 10\% \times \$2000 = \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = \$165 \times 12 = \$1980
   \]

3. Calculate the remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total payment} = \$2200 - \$1980 = \$220
   \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by each of the other students and then subtract their total from the overall score.

1. **Naomi's Score:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Score:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this gives Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \).

3. **Brianna's Score:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \).

4. **Total Points Scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   Adding up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \).

5. **Jojo's Score:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. Subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total gives Jojo's score: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \).

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine's use and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
2. It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester, which means it takes \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days to travel by car.

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to add the days for both trips:

- Days for the bus trip: 6 days
- Days for the car trip: 3 days

So, the total number of days for the round trip is \(6 + 3 = 9\) days.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons that became ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of these newly harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the final number of watermelons not ready for harvest.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
   So, 84 watermelons remained after the first harvest.

3. Calculate the number of watermelons that became ready for harvest after two weeks:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons became ready for harvest after two weeks.

4. Subtract the number of these newly harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the final number of watermelons not ready for harvest:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees for each car.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the ink of the 25 empty pens.

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new full pens plus the 25 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 30 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 30 / 5 = 6 new pens from the ink of the 30 empty pens.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 6 new full pens plus the 30 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 36 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 36 / 5 = 7 new pens from the ink of the 36 empty pens (with 1 pen left over, but it's not enough to make another full pen).

5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 7 new full pens plus the 36 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 43 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 43 / 5 = 8 new pens from the ink of the 43 empty pens (with 3 pens left over, but it's not enough to make another full pen).

6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 8 new full pens plus the 43 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 51 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 51 / 5 = 10 new pens from the ink of the 51 empty pens (with 1 pen left over, but it's not enough to make another full pen).

7. **Sixth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 10 new full pens plus the 51 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 61 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 61 / 5 = 12 new pens from the ink of the 61 empty pens (with 1 pen left over, but it's not enough to make another full pen).

8. **Seventh Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 12 new full pens plus the 61 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 73 pens.

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we need to determine each of their ages based on the information provided.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we sum their ages:
\[ \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of students who went out through exit A:**
   30% of 1000 students went out through exit A.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. **Number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remained.

3. **Number of students who went out through exit B:**
   3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. **Number of students who went out through exit C:**
   The rest of the students went out through exit C.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]
   So, 280 students went out through exit C.

**Final numerical answer:**
280"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read her two books plus Pandora's one book, which totals 3 books. Pandora will read her one book plus Dolly's two books, which also totals 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, and each book is read by at least one person, we do not double-count the books. Therefore, the total number of books read is the sum of the books each person has, which is 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books read by Dolly + 1 book read by Pandora = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read 3 books by the end.

"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages of letters a week (2 letters * 5 pages each).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages in response to each person's letters. So, for 3 pen pals, he writes 30 pages a week (10 pages per person * 3 people).

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing 30 pages, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. Calculate the minutes used for the daily calls with his boss:
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - This month has 30 days.
   - So, the total minutes for these calls are \(15 \times 30 = 450\) minutes.

2. Add the extra minutes he has used:
   - Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people.
   - So, the total minutes used are \(450 + 300 = 750\) minutes.

3. Subtract the total minutes used from the monthly allowance:
   - Jason's monthly phone plan is 1000 minutes.
   - So, the minutes left are \(1000 - 750 = 250\) minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equation based on the information given.

Let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of $30000.
- Therefore, the discount amount is $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

- The final amount Jean paid is $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Jean paid $27000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into three equal parts:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of onions the chef bought.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pound.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of onions.

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
A pound of onions costs $1.50.
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
   - The number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Since there are 30 girls in total and 27 are in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students, so the third class has 20 students in total.
   - Since there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps and then downloaded 18 more. 

To find the current number of apps, we perform the following calculation:

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \(C\). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \(3C\).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \(C = 15 - 3 = 12\).

Thus, today Rick killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:

- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)
- Cougars: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

Total animals killed: \(46 + 27 = 73\)

Therefore, Rick killed a total of 73 animals."

"First, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply Anne's count by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means there are a total of:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall will receive:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Adding these 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, each stall will now have:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

176"

\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Step 2: Determine the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weight lost due to the termites.
\[ \text{Weight lost} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 30\% = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 4: Subtract the weight lost from the original total weight to find the current weight of the redwood.
\[ \text{Current weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the current weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."

\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Additionally, she has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount she has to pay is:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea's total fruits: \(52\) apples + \(24\) bananas = \(76\) fruits.
- Jamal's total fruits: \(44\) apples + \(48\) bananas = \(92\) fruits.

Adding both totals together:

- Total fruits: \(76 + 92 = 168\).

Final numerical answer:
168"
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Total cookies = 36 cookies today + 30 cookies tomorrow = 66 cookies
2. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

3. Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]

\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]

\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in that stack.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200 \text{ pennies}
\]

Since 100 pennies make up $1.00, we can find the dollar amount by dividing the number of pennies by 100:

\[
6,200 \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

62 dollars"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\( 11 - 3 = 8 \)

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. Selling price of the house: $400,000
2. Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000
3. Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000
4. Remaining loan amount: $250,000

First, we calculate the transfer fees:
\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, we sum up all the deductions from the selling price:
\[ \text{Total deductions} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Remaining loan amount} \]
\[ \text{Total deductions} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the total deductions from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
\[ \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total deductions} \]
\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part of the process.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

**Final numerical answer:**
71 minutes"
"To calculate the total amount spent on the ads, we need to multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads for each type and then add the totals together.

For the newspaper ads:
- Cost per ad: $5
- Number of ads: 50
- Total cost for newspaper ads: $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
- Cost per ad: $75
- Number of ads: 15
- Total cost for television ads: $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads:
- Total cost for newspaper ads: $250
- Total cost for television ads: $1125
- Total cost for all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:

\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in bedrooms for both houses is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows in bedrooms and the additional windows, we get \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]
4. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total gives us the stitches for the sleeves:
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]
5. Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total sleeve stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = \$800 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
\[ \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A.
2. Calculate the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter A.
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards.
4. Calculate the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter B.
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards.
6. The rest of the cards will have the letter D.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Carly had 80 cards, and 2/5 of them had the letter A on them.
   \[
   \text{Cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
   \]

2. The remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter A:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48
   \]

3. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:
   \[
   \text{Cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

4. The remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter B:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

5. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them:
   \[
   \text{Cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
   \]

6. The rest of the cards will have the letter D:
   \[
   \text{Cards with D} = 24 - 15 = 9

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9."
"To calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to multiply the number of holes by the time it takes to dig each type of hole and then sum the results.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for small holes and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so the total sum of their ages will increase by 20 years (10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 (their current sum of ages) + 20 (the additional years for both of them) = 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
Sam is 6 years old."

- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
- To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead: \(17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

The flag has:
- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the non-5-star rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the 36 stars from the non-5-star rows from the total gives us the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5-star rows contains 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate how much money Susan earns, we need to determine the total time she works and then multiply that by her rate of earning.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
3. Converting 2.5 hours into minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes: 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.
5. Therefore, the total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. The rule is that every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's sum up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

Final numerical answer:
83"
"The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son will wash 8 oranges, and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges.

Together, they will wash \(8 + 4 = 12\) oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges in total.

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:
- Total activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household.
2. Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.

Step 1: Daily consumption
- Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
- Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) per day.
- For 5 members, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

Step 2: Weekly consumption
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg} \times 7 = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

Step 3: Duration of the 42 kg bag
- To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption: \(42 \, \text{kg} \div 14 \, \text{kg/week} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid by Carmen**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Other Participants**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other participants are:
   - First other participant: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other participant: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other participant: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other participants, so her bids are:
   - After the first other participant: $300
   - After the second other participant: $350
   - After the third other participant: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen made, including the initial bid and the subsequent bids:
   - Initial bid: $200
   - After first other participant: $300
   - After second other participant: $350
   - After third other participant: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1250 \]

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $1250."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so the total mileage charge for the year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the mileage charges and the bonuses, the total cost for the year is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **31800 dollars**."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, will have 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back. 

Given that a 32-page tabloid is made by folding a piece of paper in half, we can deduce that each piece of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid. 

To find out how many pieces of paper are needed, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper contributes:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper} \]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid."
"Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left is:

15 dollars"
"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of books sold in the first year:**
   - We know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - This year, she sold 45 books.
   - Therefore, in the first year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books.

2. **Number of books sold in the second year:**
   - We know that there are currently 50 unsold books.
   - The total number of books is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
   - We already know she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 90 - 45 = 65\).

3. **Earnings from the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the earnings from the second year are \(65 \times 20 = 1300\).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is $1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings with the bonus.
4. Determine the number of weeks in April.
5. Calculate his total earnings for April.

Step 1: Watson's daily earnings
Watson earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day.
Daily earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day

Step 2: Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus
Watson works 5 days a week.
Weekly earnings without bonus = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Step 3: Watson's weekly earnings with the bonus
Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Step 4: Number of weeks in April
April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 5: Total earnings for April
Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. So, the number of loaves sold in the morning is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. This means that the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, Sandy will lose:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week.

The final numerical answer is 4 weeks."
"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the discount for each item and then multiply by the quantity purchased.

1. **Discount on ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Sale price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Discount per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

2. **Discount on milk:**
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5

Now, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the serum will cause the person to grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"In a family of 5, if three people eat 3 eggs each day, that amounts to:

3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, which amounts to:

2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

So, the total number of eggs consumed by the family each day is:

9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

If they eat eggs every day, then in a week (7 days), the family will consume:

13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

**Final numerical answer:**
The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

It is also stated that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually show up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

14"
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He initially had 50 marbles, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
156 \text{ kgs}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Since there are 30 boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys. Since there are 30 boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of electric wires:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

Final numerical answer:
8 women are left at the party."
"A magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. Therefore, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The pen costs 1 dollar."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we consider Meg's pencils. The problem states that Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which hold 24 pencils each), we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the weakening effect of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Now, we consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding any liquid weakens the coffee, so the 15 milliliters of cream will make the coffee an additional 15 milliliters weaker.

Adding the weakening effects together, the total weakening of the coffee is:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and the total number of new records traded for.

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people trade and leave with 7 new records.

First, we calculate the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records. Since 1 new record is obtained by trading 2 old records, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Therefore, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - Therefore, the number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

3. **Calculate the monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

4. **Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Therefore, the monthly salary for each senior programmer is \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We are told that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points.

First, we find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge 40 percentage points:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

If Erin gives 3 of her lollipops to Ella, she will have:

17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon applied twice the amount of the rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon applied $4 \times 2 = 8$ dollars off the price.

So, the amount after applying the rewards and the coupon is:

\[ 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job has a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
2. Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final numerical answer:
44"
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard has 5 guns, and Jason (RJ) has 1 gun. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Jason, and Richard), so we divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns if they shared their guns equally."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

1. For the suckers:
   - Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for 1 batch.
   - For 8 batches, he would need \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

2. For the fudge:
   - Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for 1 batch.
   - For 1 batch, he would need \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 + 70 = 310 \) ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Therefore, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Final value of all Maria's shares:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group, therefore, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of cows.
- \( H \) as the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

So, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, using \( H = 2C \):
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore:
- The total number of legs from cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- The total number of legs from chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 1 (ball added each week) * 4 (weeks) = 3 + 4 = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. Out of these, 2 are caught and 1 is lost. So, he loses a total of 1 ball from his juggling act.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:

7 (total balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 6 balls

6 balls"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is:
2 * 24 = 48 baby outfits.

Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we add all these amounts together:
24 (from her friend) + 48 (from the baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87 baby outfits.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (assuming June has 30 days).

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
\[ 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days).
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, let's first determine the prices of each juice box.

1. Juice Box A is priced at 4 dollars.
2. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
   Juice Box B = 4 dollars + 5 dollars = 9 dollars.
3. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
   Juice Box C = 4 dollars + 7 dollars = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:
   Juice Box C - Juice Box B = 11 dollars - 9 dollars = 2 dollars.

Therefore, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B."
"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then add the results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two results together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies each day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies her son and husband eat from the total number of cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies, which is:

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = $30 * 2 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's assume Morgan is one of the people attending the party. We need to find out how much money is left for her friends after accounting for her own expenses.

5. **Morgan's total cost**: $30
6. **Total budget**: $90
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to cover the cost of $30 (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens).

8. **Number of friends Morgan can invite**: $60 / $30 = 2

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the $2.00 he spent on gumballs is half of his change.
   - Therefore, his total change before buying gumballs = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10 and had $4.00 left after buying gumballs.
   - Amount spent on candy = $10 - $4.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = $6.00 / $1.50 per pound = 4 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and then to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than this combined distance, so it is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The train travels from the first city to the second city (75 miles), then from the second city to the third city (100 miles), and then from the third city back to the first city (125 miles).
   - The total distance for one complete trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance for three trips:**
   - Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Calculate the number of days between services:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total miles between services by the miles traveled in one day: \(18,000 \div 900 = 20\).

Therefore, the train goes between services every 20 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of stuffing for a collie bed:**
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of stuffing.

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds of stuffing.

4. **Add the amounts together to find the total amount of stuffing needed:**
   - Total stuffing for chihuahua beds: 8 pounds
   - Total stuffing for collie beds: 15 pounds
   - Total stuffing needed: \(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Distance: 220 miles (200 miles to the friend's house + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 220 miles / 70 mph = 3.142857 hours

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both legs of the trip:

Total Time = 3.142857 hours + 3 hours = 6.142857 hours

Rounding to two decimal places, the total time is approximately 6.14 hours.

**Final Answer:**
6.14 hours"
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored and then find out how many more points she needs to reach the minimum requirement of 42 points.

First, we add the points from her first and second tests:
15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33 points

Next, we subtract the total points she has from the required minimum:
42 (required points) - 33 (points already scored) = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons (refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale) is:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Given that the total number of people kicked out is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

19"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, we need to find out how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara has 8 points, we calculate:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin's current points are 24. We know that she scored 14 points to reach this total. Therefore, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching for all picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total cost for etching = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,208.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,208."
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Final numerical answer:

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice in a week.

5 hours"
"To calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount to find the value of the functioning pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the faulty pieces of equipment.
40% of $400,000 is faulty.
\[ \text{Value of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

Step 2: Subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount to find the value of the functioning pieces.
\[ \text{Value of functioning pieces} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them produce 1 kg of milk each, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.

For the first half (15 sheep):
- Each sheep produces 1 kg of milk.
- So, 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

For the second half (15 sheep):
- Each sheep produces 2 kg of milk.
- So, 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both groups:
- 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk.

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, she had:
12 rolls - 6 rolls = 6 rolls remaining.

6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, she fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens."
"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 pupils like blue.

2. Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 pupils remain.

3. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate one-fourth of 20:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 pupils like green.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.
   - Each apple is sold for $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) apples.

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   - Apples picked on Monday: 14
   - Apples picked on Tuesday: 12

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate would be:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Number of Months}}{12}\right) \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue to find the profit. The cost of the supplies is $18, so the profit is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can sell all 36 cups, we need to determine how many hours it will take her to sell all the lemonade. The time taken to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of a ride bracelet for David:**
   - The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

2. **Cost of tickets for Dasha:**
   - Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for one ride is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
   - For 9 rides, Dasha would need \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

3. **Total cost for Dasha:**
   - Dasha buys tickets for all 9 rides, so the total cost is $36.

4. **Total cost for David:**
   - David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which covers all 9 rides.

5. **Savings for David:**
   - The cost for David is $30.
   - The cost for Dasha is $36.
   - Therefore, David saves \(36 - 30 = $6\).

David saves $6 by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together:

6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for bows on these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles, which is given as 165. So, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services he is getting.

1. Netflix costs $10 a month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost per month for both is reduced.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus:
- The original cost for both is $10 + $10 = $20.
- A 20% discount on $20 is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- So, the discounted cost for both is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Total cost for streaming services = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package to find out how much Tim saves:
- Savings = $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package."
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. She also spends 90 minutes editing, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of her total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\), and the total number of cards she received is 17.

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards:

- Cards given away: 29
- Cards received: 17

Net change: \(29 - 17 = 12\)

So, the number of cards Erica now has is the initial number of cards minus the net change:

\(50 - 12 = 38\)

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, Mark gets:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save: $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount in the bank) = $250.
2. Determine how much money Mark earns per day: $10.
3. Calculate the number of days required to save $250: $250 / $10 = 25 days.

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

25 days"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs = \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

Total bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total bugs = 168

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can follow these steps:

1. We know Erica's age is 30 years.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

Now, to find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:

42 - 30 = 12

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. Therefore, he drinks a total of:

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces of milk.

If milk has 3 calories per ounce, then the total calories consumed are:

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories.

He consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of weeks the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the monthly earnings.
4. Multiply the monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to get the annual earnings.

Step 1: The builder works for 4 weeks every month.

Step 2: The builder works for 6 days every week. Therefore, in a month, the builder works:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Step 3: The builder gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, the monthly earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$1200/\text{month} \]

Step 4: There are 12 months in a year, so the annual earnings are:
\[ \$1200/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$14400/\text{year} \]

Therefore, the builder earns \(\$14400\) in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags of flour

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes from these two zebras = 2 * 17 = 34 stripes

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes from this zebra = 36 stripes

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 = 36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes = 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes

Next, we count the total number of zebras:
- Total zebras = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 zebras

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras:
- Average number of stripes = 88 / 4 = 22 stripes

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, to serve 20 people, Tyson needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]
Adding these together gives:
\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:
\[ \$50.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corns in relation to cannolis**: There are twice as much corn as cannolis. So, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. **Additional cannolis**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Additional corns**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) more corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

- Total cannolis: 100
- Total corns: 100

Combined total: \(100 + 100 = 200\)

**Final numerical answer**: 200"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. Elliott needs to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Let's calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog:

- Steps from walks to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, the total steps he needed to reach his goal of 10,000 steps is:

10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and then compare it to the time he has before he needs to leave.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. Additionally, it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time he spends before leaving is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Payment per employee per hour: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Payment per employee per hour: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - Taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Cost of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets.
   - Total cost for magnets = 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - Total cost = $7.00.
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

**Final Answer:**
Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the information provided does not specify the percentage of candles that explode. We only know that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and that all candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 

Given the information, we can only calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog, but we cannot determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode without additional information about the explosion rate.

Let's calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:

1. First, we find the number of more dangerous candles. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we need to know what percentage of the total candles are considered more dangerous. However, this information is not provided, so we will assume that the 5% refers to the entire batch of 50,000 candles.

2. Calculate 5% of 50,000 candles:
\[ 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

So, 2500 candles will smell like wet dog.

Since we do not have the information about the explosion rate, we cannot determine how many of these 2500 candles will also explode. 

Final numerical answer (for the number of candles that smell like wet dog):
\[ 2500 \]

Without the explosion rate, we cannot provide a final numerical answer for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount on each blouse is 30% of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can write the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, and since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have \( 2C + D = 304 \).

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To find the number of dromedaries (\( D \)), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can substitute \( C \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances he traveled each segment of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Distance traveled: 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days
   - Distance for 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. **Next day (no travel):**
   - Distance: 0 km

4. **Second week:**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each type of jeans:**
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2.
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is the remaining part of the total savings, which is $6 - $2 = $4.

4. **Calculate the original cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22.
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is $2.
   - Therefore, the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original cost of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original cost of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $24 = $4 less than the tattered jeans.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which seems to be a misinterpretation based on the given information. The correct interpretation should be how much less the jogger jeans originally cost compared to the tattered jeans.

**Final Answer:**
The jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans."
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up all the capacities to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket ($100) to cover. So, the money he gets from selling the cards is $150 (because $150 - $50 = $100).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs. So, 18 guests would get two hotdogs, and the other 18 would get one hotdog.
2. The total number of hotdogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the first hotdog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

4. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, and 40 guests each want a second hotdog, we need to calculate how many hotdogs are left after the first round of distribution:
   - 40 guests * 1 hotdog = 40 hotdogs (first round)
   - 54 hotdogs - 40 hotdogs = 14 hotdogs left

5. With 14 hotdogs left, 14 guests can get a second hotdog.

6. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 40 guests - 14 guests = 26 guests

Final numerical answer:
26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we calculate 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to determine how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora currently has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent on chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
   - Total cost for chips = 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents = $1.20.

2. **Calculate the amount George had left after buying the chips:**
   - George spent $1.20 on chips.
   - He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.
   - Let's denote the total amount George had initially as \( x \) dollars.
   - After spending $1.20, he had \( x - 1.20 \) dollars left.
   - According to the problem, \( x - 1.20 \) is 1% of \( x \).
   - Therefore, \( x - 1.20 = 0.01x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x - 0.01x = 1.20 \)
   - \( 0.99x = 1.20 \)
   - \( x = \frac{1.20}{0.99} \)
   - \( x \approx 1.2121 \) dollars (rounded to four decimal places).

4. **Calculate the amount George spent on candy bars:**
   - George initially had $5.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars = $5 - $1.20 = $3.80.

5. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents or $0.75.
   - Number of candy bars = \(\frac{3.80}{0.75} \approx 5.0667\).

Since George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, he must have bought 5 candy bars.

**Final Answer:**
George bought 5 candy bars."

"To find the cost per serving, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use.
2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Calculate the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Step 1: Antoine doubles the amount of onions from 2 pounds to 4 pounds.

Step 2: The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost for 4 pounds is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Step 3: The cost of beef stock is $2.00 per box, and he needs 2 boxes. Therefore, the cost for the beef stock is:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Step 4: The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:
\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Step 5: The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this to solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, we calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Next, we calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Opening the Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees every 10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
   - Total temperature decrease = 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can calculate the time James took for the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is 59 minutes."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes.
2. Determine the length of Movie B.

First, we convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:
\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:
\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, we need to determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money Michael has to find the change:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the change Michael has after buying the hay is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses of eggnog}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."

- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's points: 240
- Marcy's points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.**

- He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at a flash sale on Monday:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

- The rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) were sold to a department store for $25 each:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

- Total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( ($15 + P) - $21 = $2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( $15 + P - $21 = $2 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, we find the cost of filling one balloon on the first day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. At 60 mph for 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. At 30 mph for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add the distances to get the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.**

The volume of a raised bed is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.**

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed.**

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.**

Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

The total cost of the potting soil is $1920."

2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9
   - Therefore, the number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   - Sum of red and green cards = 15 + 24 = 39
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards = 39

4. **Total Cards**: To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.
   - Total cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 

To calculate 60% of Frederick's plants:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To calculate the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to determine the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the order cost.

The order cost is $15.

The tip amount is 1/5 of $15, which is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the original order cost to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Order Cost} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (last place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 98\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\).

So, Finley finished in 96th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's final cost from Kelly's final cost:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items would be:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

Final numerical answer:
1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he starts with 100 pairs (200 shoes / 2 = 100 pairs).

2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. So, he now has 100 + 5 = 105 pairs.

3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs. So, he now has 105 + 15 = 120 pairs.

4. On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs. So, he now has 120 + 30 = 150 pairs.

5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Since he has 150 pairs, he can only get rid of 150 pairs, not 180. So, he will have 0 pairs left after getting rid of all his shoes.

Therefore, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 0 shoes."
"To determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles.
2. Determine how many pans are needed to bake that many cupcakes.

First, we know that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes, and Mary has 6 jars. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we know that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans are needed to bake 48 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2, and the paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is:
3 * $2 = $6

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the start:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   - Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

Step 1: Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- Each remora is 6 inches long, so in feet, each remora is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.
- Benny has 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage.
- The shark's body length is 10 feet.
- The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.
- The percentage is calculated as \( \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \).

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the number of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( B \) as the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

From the problem, we have:
- \( D = 9 \)
- \( P = 6 \)
- \( B = 3 \)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ D + P - B = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[

Next, we know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (since the second pack is free).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, after all discounts, is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the pyramid. The pyramid is structured as follows:

- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on top of the 4
- 2 cheerleaders on top of the 3
- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) at the top

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, we can assume the shortest cheerleader is the one who is 60 inches tall.

Now, let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:

- Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders): \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- Second layer (3 cheerleaders): \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- Third layer (2 cheerleaders): \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- Top layer (1 cheerleader): \(60\) inches

Adding these together gives us the total height in inches:

\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}\]

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. Therefore, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Angela is currently 38 years old. 

Final numerical answer:
38"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Final numerical answer:
Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

Mariah's yarn usage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Grandma's yarn usage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total yards of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

   \[2 \times 5 = 10\]

2. Next, calculate the number of gifts for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
   \[3 \times 2 = 6\]

3. Then, add the 10 random gifts that Cherrie decided to buy:
   \[10 + 10 = 20\]

4. Finally, add the gifts for the 2 friends and the 3 friends to the 10 random gifts:
   \[10 + 6 + 10 = 26\]

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:
   \[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet wide} \]

2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is:
   \[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]
   Therefore, the length of the couch is:
   \[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

The couch is 18 feet long."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1 (since half of $2 is $1).
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200."
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this five days a week. Therefore, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost for her bus trips would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From the first point, if the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have half that number of cows, which is not relevant to the number of sheep or cows we already know.

From the second point, if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have half that number of sheep, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep + (the number of cows, which is not specified but not needed for the total) = 20 sheep (since the number of cows in the zoo is not relevant to the final count).

Adding the animals from both the farm and the zoo:

40 (farm's animals) + 20 (zoo's sheep) = 60 animals.

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 60 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought: 4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to be burned**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, the total number of calories to be burned is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit**

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Calculate the remaining money after buying clothes.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs.
4. Calculate the remaining money after buying CDs.

Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes.
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 100 \]
So, Julie spent $100 on clothes.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying clothes.
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]
So, Julie had $400 left after buying clothes.

Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on CDs.
Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 100 \]
So, Julie spent $100 on CDs.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining money after buying CDs.
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]
So, Julie had $300 left after buying CDs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the first equation \( H = 3L \), we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold each bag for $8. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
So, the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is $160."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tony's Picking Rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's Picking Rate**: Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's Picking Rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's Picking Rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four of them, we add their individual rates:

- Tony: 6 quarts/hour
- Bobby: 5 quarts/hour
- Kathy: 10 quarts/hour
- Ricky: 8 quarts/hour

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption.
2. Calculate the new daily electric consumption after adding the device.
3. Calculate the weekly electric consumption for both scenarios.
4. Find the difference in weekly electric bills.

**Step 1: Current daily consumption**
Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.

**Step 2: New daily consumption**
The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. Therefore, the new daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} + 2 \, \text{kWh} = 14 \, \text{kWh} \]

**Step 3: Weekly consumption**
There are 7 days in a week, so:
- Current weekly consumption: \( 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{kWh} \)
- New weekly consumption: \( 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 98 \, \text{kWh} \)

**Step 4: Weekly electric bill**
The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.
- Current weekly bill: \( 84 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126 \)
- New weekly bill: \( 98 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147 \)

2. **Determine the rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people working together can paint the same house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

3. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 22

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has as follows:

Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Since Ophelia and Jenna have the same number of sofas as chairs, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has as follows:

Jenna's sofas = Jenna's chairs
Jenna's sofas = 66

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas
Total sofas = 20 + 66
Total sofas = 86

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs
Total chairs = 22 + 66
Total chairs = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = 86 + 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = 174

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set and then calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount if he had not bought the headphone set.

1. First, we know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total cost was $48. So, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44
   \]

2. Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount available}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
   \]

3. Since Tom originally bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
   \[
   \text{Additional CDs} = \text{Total CDs he could have bought} - \text{CDs he originally bought} = 12 - 1 = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set."
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 hours or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, he worked out for 4 hours in \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, we can calculate the total hours:
- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:
\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[ 48 - 8 = 40 \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[ 80 - 21 = 59 \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[ 59 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin now:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - The cousin's current age is 47.
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:

Total cost = Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor
$2,400 = $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Simplifying the equation:

$2,400 = $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:

$2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
$600 = 2 * Cost of one monitor

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

60 (number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many seashells as the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Each girl brought 300 seashells."
"Before George ate 5 candies, he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies."
"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is:
10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is:
6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all four books to find the total thickness:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together gives us the total number of vlogs made in the first three weeks:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - 20% of $50 is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \).

2. **Add the tip to the base bill:**
   - Total bill = Base bill + Tip
   - Total bill = $50 + $10 = $60.

3. **Split the total bill evenly:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between two people, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Each person pays \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

4. **Determine how much you end up paying:**
   - You end up paying $30.

So, the final numerical answer is:
30"
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then adds $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he adds another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spends $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he triples the amount he has left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). Therefore, the total savings for the second half of the month would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month should be $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]

\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave the seller $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is:
\[
\$7.00

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.
- He completed 20 tasks.

So, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 × 20 = $16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.

So, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 × 20 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
- Difference = Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it in full twice means she writes \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.

3. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two steps and the 13 letters from the third step, which totals \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

\[52 + 13 + 65 = 130\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. In each round, the number of families notified triples.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so 27 * 3 = 81 families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the number of toys in James's play set. According to the problem, James's play set has 80 toys.

2. Jonathan wants to have a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan wants to have is:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this number. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of toys Jonathan needs is:
   \[
   x + 2
   \]

4. We know that the number of toys Jonathan needs to have is 400, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To calculate the total cost Daniel has to spend, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy without the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
2. Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
3. Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[ \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00 \]

Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He expects 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

Therefore, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, we first calculate twice the time it takes him in cold water:

\[ 2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to this time:

\[ 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time it takes Ray to swim one mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \( 3 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \)
- Warm water: \( 3 \times 34 \text{ minutes} = 102 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in time:

\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost of your lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub first, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. 

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of your lunch:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost of your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
70"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups.
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) cups.
3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) cups.
4. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended daily intake from Juan's current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(130 \times 2 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, and it moves 50 degrees straight upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"To determine how many candles James needs, we first need to find out the ages of his sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger than the older one. Therefore, the younger son is:

12 - 4 = 8 years old

Now, we need to find the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, he needs:

12 + 8 = 20 candles

Next, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

4 × $3 = $12

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of pages she can read in 1 minute by the total number of minutes she read in the first week:
\[ \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, we are given that she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Together, they ate:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

5 sandwiches are left."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth each earned $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Liam made $63.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we calculate his earnings as follows:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Now, to find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate how much Peter spends each day from Sunday to Wednesday.
2. Determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday.
3. Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money from Thursday to Saturday.
4. Sum the total number of action figures he buys.

First, let's find out how much Peter spends each day from Sunday to Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money he has left after Wednesday is:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each for the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), which is 3 days. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

From Sunday to Wednesday, he bought wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 23."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up the costs of spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month.
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Compare the total number of roses Ford grows in a month with the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.
- For simplicity, we will assume a month has 4 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Total roses grown in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.
- Total roses needed per week = 65 roses
- Total roses needed in a month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses

Step 5: Determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.
- Roses needed in a month = 260 roses
- Roses grown in a month = 160 roses

Roses lacking = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
     - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

- She has 3 boxes of crayons.
- Each box contains 64 crayons.

So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many ""muffin crayons"" she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffin crayons} \]

Now, if she sells each muffin crayon for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kate can make $36."
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet itself, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of removal} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is **$11232**."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's sum these up:
50 (Day 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4 and 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 300 birds

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average:
300 birds / 7 days = 42.857142857142854

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 43.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe, we need to set the oven to a temperature that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the price of Herb's house. 

Herb's house cost $76,000. 

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

Judy's total: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
Her friend's total: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

Total number of utensils brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is $1.00. However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since the problem does not specify that contacts are sold in pairs, we assume the cost is per individual contact. If contacts are indeed sold in pairs, we would need additional information to determine the cost per pair. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:

$70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Final numerical answer:
$40"
"First, we need to calculate the total calories Hannah burns from both activities.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

100 ml / 200 calories = x ml / 1600 calories

Solving for x:
x = (100 ml * 1600 calories) / 200 calories
x = 160000 ml * calories / (200 calories)
x = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."

- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \(3 \times 2 = 6\) grams of protein.

Step 2: If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he consumes 6 grams of protein each day. To find out how much protein he consumes in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week).

So, \(6 \times 7 = 42\) grams of protein per week.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so we subtract this from the total cost:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Each gumball costs a nickel, so we need to find out how many nickels he can get from his other coins.

Colby has:
- 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, so 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels, which are worth 5 cents each, so 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has in cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this, so the final weight he uses is:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to account for the games he receives and the games he buys each year.

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve receives 5 games for his birthday.

2. **First Year:**
   - He buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
   - Total games bought in the first year: \(1 \times 12 = 12\)
   - Games received for Christmas: 5
   - Total games after the first year: \(5 + 12 + 5 = 22\)

3. **Second Year:**
   - He buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
   - Total games bought in the second year: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)
   - Games received for Christmas: 5
   - Total games after the second year: \(22 + 24 + 5 = 51\)

4. **Third Year:**
   - He buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
   - Total games bought in the third year: \(4 \times 12 = 48\)
   - Games received for Christmas: 5
   - Total games after the third year: \(51 + 48 + 5 = 104\)

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has a total of 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed of the plane = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

5 hours"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolate each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolate they made together:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   - He spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   - He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars on Wednesday.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Total amount spent over the three days is \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

5. **Initial Amount:**
   - Howard originally had $100.

6. **Remaining Amount:**
   - Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount is \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings for the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each part:

First four hours:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30

Next two hours:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings:
$30 + $12 = $42

Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per tire over a year (12 months):
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per bottle.
2. Determine the number of pumps used per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of washings per bottle is 120.

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then the number of pumps used per washing is 1.

Next, we need to find out how many washings the bottle can provide if 1 pump is used per wash. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half as many washings, which is 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, and it provides 60 washings when 1 pump is used per wash. Therefore, the cost per washing is:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{60 \text{ washings}} = 0.40 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, 0.40 dollars is equal to 40 cents. Therefore, the cost per washing is 40 cents. Since each washing uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is also 40 cents.

The final numerical answer is:

40"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe is purchasing.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $25:

\[ 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discount on the shirt is $7.50. Therefore, the price of the shirt after the discount is:

\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:

\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford the outfit with the given budget. Therefore, he will not have any money left after the purchase, and in fact, he will be short by:

\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \text{Joe will be short by } \$2.50. \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month's cost.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - The cost for the 8th month is \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\).
   - The cost for the 9th month is \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\).
   - The cost for the 10th month is \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\).

Now, we sum up the costs for the remaining 5 months:
\[150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125\]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months:
\[100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $2,078,125."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

Total number of posts in March = 93,000

93,000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."

"To calculate the total number of cars towed in that week, we can break down the problem as follows:

- For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, the total is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.
- For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day. So, for four days, the total is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Adding these together, the total number of cars towed in the week is \(30 + 24 = 54\).

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

Step 1: Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 40 by 12:
\[ 40 \div 12 = 3 \text{ feet and } 4 \text{ inches} \]
So, Adam is 3 feet 4 inches tall.

Step 2: Determine the height difference.
The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Adam's current height is 3 feet 4 inches, which is 3.33 feet (since 4 inches is \(\frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33\) feet).
The height difference is:
\[ 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.
Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667\) feet per year.
To find out how many years it will take to grow 0.67 feet, we divide 0.67 by 0.1667:
\[ 0.67 \div 0.1667 \approx 4 \]

Therefore, it will take Adam approximately 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made \(\boxed{17500}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
2. Determine how many of those riders are men.

Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright.
- 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Step 2: Determine how many of those riders are men.
- 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.
- This means 40% of the riders who can stay upright are men (since 100% - 60% = 40%).
- 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 men.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel, which is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
4800
\]"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
- Snowflake stamps: 16
- Truck stamps: 19
- Rose stamps: 10

Total number of stamps = \(16 + 19 + 10 = 45\).

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes.

The cost per class would then be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class would exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes in a week and then sum these numbers.

First, let's find out how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each of them. There are 7 days in a week, so:

- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers per week.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers per week.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for the two of them:

\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, five apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, five oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

The volume of the hole is:
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time required to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth is:
\[ \text{Time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To calculate the total cost of everything James bought, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

Therefore, the total cost of everything James bought is $10800."

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the costs for the 3 hours he is charged for:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 during the week. This means she received an additional $220 in the week. Since her weekly wage should be $300, and she received $220, the difference between her expected wage and the amount she received is the amount that was withheld.

To find the amount withheld, we subtract the amount received from her expected wage:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (received) = $80

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - $150,000

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   - $5,000

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - Twice the hanger rental cost, so $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
- Total monthly cost = Hanger rental cost + Fuel cost
- Total monthly cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
- Total cost for the first year = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total maintenance cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost + Total maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice**: It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Cooking Time for Pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than it did to cook the rice. So, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. **Cooking Time for Beans**: The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes."

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day). Therefore, the cost of the coffee for a week is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut together, we get:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 44 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the basketball court.

Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:
\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have $120."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, we calculate the number of employees who are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they shared equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, we need to divide this total equally among the three of them:

12 pounds ÷ 3 people = 4 pounds per person

So, if they share the candy equally, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A, each costing $0.5, is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B, each costing $0.75, is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total cost of the candies:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11.0 \]

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4.0 \]

Therefore, the change Adam got is $4.0."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. Since her first 8 days were good, her next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days - Good days - Bad days = Neutral days
30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days

Now, we are told that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means we need to add these to the existing count of good and neutral days:

Good days before + Good days in the last three days = Total good days
12 + 2 = 14 good days

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. Since he left with 12 dogs, there are now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. This means he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. The number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Therefore, he needs 21 toys in total.

The final numerical answer is:
21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total initial investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. Frances invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:

"To reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Adding these together:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Now, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100 signatures:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her earnings for 6 hours are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To determine how much the group of people will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator from this total.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Therefore, the total weight of 9 adults is \( 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 9 \, \text{adults} = 720 \, \text{kg} \).

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight:
   - The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg.
   - The excess weight is \( 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \).

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) centimeters. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 centimeters."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode and then calculate the total time based on his experiment.

First, let's find the mowing rates for each mode:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for each half to find the total time:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much time they have left, we need to subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 6 minutes (to the corner) - 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals 2 * $2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which totals 2 * $3 = $6

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they have \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 23 \]

Divide by 4:

\[ x = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \]

So, the age of the older triplet (and thus the age of the twin) is:

\[ x + 7 = 5.75 + 7 = 12.75 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 12.75 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework.

John has:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these times together:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time John will spend on his homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost for four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by four:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives us the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month and then over ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years, which is 120 months, Rong will have saved:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years, which is 120 months, Neil will have saved:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Therefore, the heartworm check costs \( 0.60T \).

3. The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
   - \( T = $40 + 0.60T \).

4. Solve for \( T \):
   - \( T - 0.60T = $40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = $40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{$40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = $100 \).

5. John brought $125 with him.
   - The total bill is $100.
   - The amount he leaves with is \( $125 - $100 = $25 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate, so the cost of bananas in a crate is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate, so the cost of apples in a crate is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate, so the cost of oranges in a crate is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost of the crate is the sum of the cost of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, we sum up all the squares:
\[14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

1. **Determine the number of high chairs needed:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs needed:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs needed = number of high chairs + number of regular chairs.
   - Total chairs needed = 8 + 40 = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total people = 42 + 15 = 57.

5. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed = total people - total chairs available.
   - Since the total chairs available are 48, the additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9.

Therefore, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate 50% of 50:
\[ 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 25 \]
So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5 \]
So, there are 5 8 point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[ 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points} \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[ 65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points} \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[ 3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points} \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[ 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person will take one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, they will need 20 seats, 40 drinks (2 drinks per person), and 60 snacks (3 snacks per person).

The cost of drinks and snacks is $2 each. Therefore, the total cost for drinks is:

40 drinks * $2/drink = $80

And the total cost for snacks is:

60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together gives the total amount spent:

$80 + $120 = $200

So, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the amount Gary's truck can haul is:
\[ 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 \text{ dumplings (females)} + 32 \text{ dumplings (males)} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, we subtract that amount from his initial share to find out how much he has left.

$60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the turtle.
2. Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

First, we know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. The cat's speed is given as 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: The total city usage is 40%, and the industrial usage is 32%. Therefore, the non-industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes."
"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

Step 1: There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Step 2: Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is \(12 \times 14\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production over 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we first need to find the cost of each type of item he ordered and then sum these costs. After that, we apply the 10% discount from his loyalty card.

1. Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each
   \[5 \times 3.00 = 15.00\]

2. Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each
   \[4 \times 2.50 = 10.00\]

3. Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
\[50.00 \times 0.10 = 5.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total:
\[50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works with these 4 scoops. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, with 4 scoops, she can get 2 scoops free (since 4 divided by 2 is 2).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she will get is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy will have left after two weeks, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, we calculate how much candy each has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy they have left:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The initial cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound is $1.5, and James picked 30 pounds.
- Therefore, the cost for the blueberries themselves is \(30 \times 1.5 = 45\) dollars.
- Adding the initial cost, the total cost of picking is \(20 + 45 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5, and James picked 30 pounds.
- Therefore, the total cost at the store is \(30 \times 2.5 = 75\) dollars.

Now, we can find out how much James saved by subtracting the cost of picking from the cost of buying:
- The savings is \(75 - 65 = 10\) dollars.

So, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the new price of each computer.
The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase means the new price is 110% of the original price.

\[ \text{New Price} = 700 \times 1.10 = 770 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers at the new price.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pizzas ordered**: Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, so there are a total of 5 pizzas.

2. **Total number of slices**: Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) slices.

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**: They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices. Bryce and two friends together ate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**: They ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices each. Together, they ate \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.

5. **Total slices eaten**: The total number of slices eaten is \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

6. **Slices left**: The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten, which is \( 60 - 42 = 18 \) slices.

   - Since 24 smores are needed and 24 smores can be made from one box, they will need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate her father's age as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate her mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 34 \]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the number of people who will share it, which includes Greg and his 3 younger siblings, making a total of 4 people.

The total amount of money is $20, and it needs to be split equally among 4 people.

So, we perform the division: $20 ÷ 4 = $5.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weight of each book together.

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, and there are 2 of them, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, Candidate A received:
   \[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

2. Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A's votes. So, Candidate B received:
   \[ 20 \text{ votes} + 50\% \times 20 \text{ votes} = 20 \text{ votes} + 10 \text{ votes} = 30 \text{ votes} \]

3. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for Candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for Candidates A and B from the total:
   \[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Therefore, Candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to adjust the number of apples each has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's new number of apples} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's new number of apples} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's new number of apples} - \text{Beck's new number of apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 + 14 + 4 = 30\] ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
\[32 - 30 = 2\] ounces.

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of books Clara has} = 2 \times \text{Number of books Steven has} \]

Given that Clara has 20 books, we can substitute and solve for the number of books Steven has:

\[ 20 = 2 \times \text{Number of books Steven has} \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of books Alice has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = \text{Number of books Steven has} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Finally, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of books Clara has} - \text{Number of books Alice has} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98."
"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in both classes**: 80 students.
2. **Number of students in each class**: Since the two classes have the same number of students, we divide the total by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
3. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40%.
4. **Number of girls in each class**: To find the number of girls, we calculate 40% of 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 16
   \]
5. **Number of boys in each class**: Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students are boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"To determine the savings, we first need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park for a family of 2 adults and 2 children.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12/child = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10/child = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park:
- Savings: $76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the difference in cost per tomato and then multiply that by the number of tomatoes sold per day, and finally, multiply by the number of days in a week.

1. The cost per tomato with the new vendor is $0.40.
2. The cost per tomato with the old vendor was $0.50.
3. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
4. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are $0.10 * 500 = $50.

"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has. If Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, then Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Cal has:

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, Carl has:

\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \text{ marbles} \]

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles each has:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles."

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of weekday and weekend rentals, which is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

4. **Total Rentals in Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.
2. Multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the annual share for each roommate.

Step 1: The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally. So, the monthly share for each person is:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Step 2: To find the annual share, we multiply the monthly share by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the trades step by step and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 9 = 49 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = 0.50 * 49 = 24.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 24 large buttons = 24 * 3 = 72 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 + 72 = 75 small buttons and 49 - 24 = 25 large stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 25 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 25 large stickers = 25 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 25 large buttons = 25 * 3 = 75 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 75 + 75 = 150 small buttons.

5. **Final Count of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 150 small buttons and 0 large buttons.

Therefore, the final number of buttons Lorraine has is 150."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be represented as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts needed:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. However, since we are asked for the final numerical answer, we will use the exact fraction:
\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many pears George has, and then add that number to the number of bananas he has to find the total number of fruits.

1. George has 45% more pears than bananas.
2. George has 200 bananas.

First, we calculate 45% of the number of bananas:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:
\[ 200 \text{ (bananas)} + 290 \text{ (pears)} = 490 \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"Marissa initially had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. So, the remaining amount of money she had is:

$80 - $20 = $60

Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars Marissa could buy with the remaining $60, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, for 20 kilograms of oranges, the cost would be:

\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60 \]

Sam would have to spend \(\$60\) to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing the number of books Ezra read by 2:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Now, to find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:

450 + 150 = 600 books

Therefore, they have read a total of 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching."
"To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type sold and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = Vanilla scents sold - Fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, we calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each:

\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, we determine how much more money Bennet needs to reach his goal of $135:

\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell to make the additional $75. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:

\[ \$75 \div 25 \text{ ears} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time for soccer and video games is:

Remaining time = Total time - Reading time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Video game time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time she spends playing soccer is the remaining time after accounting for reading and video games:

Soccer time = Remaining time - Video game time = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Soccer time / Total time) * 100

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time back from the museum:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles, and the speed is the same, 75 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to the museum: 2 hours
- Time at the museum: 6 hours
- Time back from the museum: 2 hours

Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately, and then add them together.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels used from the total number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the number of wheels that will be left is:
276 wheels"
"To calculate the final price after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you first find 20% of $1000 and then subtract that from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   These series cost $6 each, and a normal movie costs $10, so the savings per series movie is:
   \[
   10 - 6 = 4 \text{ dollars per series movie}
   \]
   Therefore, the total savings for the series movies is:
   \[
   200 \times 4 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]
   These older movies cost $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Normal movies**: The remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]
   These normal movies cost $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total cost**: Add the cost of the older movies and the normal movies, and subtract the savings from the series movies:
   \[
   800 + 2400 - 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movie collection with digital versions is:
\[
\boxed{2400}
\]"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches**: 
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00\)

2. **Plums**: 
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \(8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00\)

3. **Apricots**: 
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00\)

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of fruit to find the overall cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, Winston spent \(\$38.00\) on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 4.5 hours (since the total time was 6 hours and they hiked for 1.5 hours) at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Time driven} \times \text{Speed driven} = 4.5 \, \text{hours} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} = 225 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 25 miles per hour, so their hiking speed is:

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance they hiked:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Time hiked} \times \text{Hiking speed} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 20 \, \text{miles/hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to get the total distance to their vacation spot:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the points for both Ava and Emma based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( E_e \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) as the time Emma finishes the level with (in seconds).

Then, for Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma)

The points for each are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ 215 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in those 5 days is:

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those two days, they ride:

2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day

Therefore, the number of rides on those two days is:

6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days, we get the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding them, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish in the pond is \( 3 + O \), and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.**

- One-way distance: 5 miles
- Round trip distance: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
- Number of workdays in a week: 5
- Total weekly distance: 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.**

- Fuel efficiency: 10 miles per gallon
- Total fuel used: 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

- Price of gas: $3 per gallon
- Total cost: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on gas for his commute to work."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:
10 * $20 = $200

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
$200 + $35 = $235

Next, we need to calculate how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on twenties is:
(3/5) * $200 = $120

The amount spent on quarters is:
$35 (since she spent all of them)

So, the total amount spent is:
$120 + $35 = $155

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
$155"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

Therefore, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants."

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John still needs after the school's contribution.
4. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he still needs.

Step 1: The total cost of the trip is $300.

Step 2: The school will cover half the cost of the trip, so the school's contribution is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Step 3: The amount John still needs after the school's contribution is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

Step 4: John already has $50, so the amount he is still missing is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing $100."
"To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature inside the house needs to be at least 32 degrees. 

During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. During the night, it is 33 degrees colder than during the day. So, the temperature at night would be:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference between the temperature needed to prevent the pipes from freezing (32 degrees) and the nighttime temperature (12 degrees):

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of 9-person groups formed.

"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing both songs based on the given frequencies and durations.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, and each time it takes 150 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \(2 \times 150 = 300\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and it takes 240 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is \(1 \times 240 = 240\) seconds.

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the overall caroling duration:
- Total caroling time = \(300 + 240 = 540\) seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Billy's starting hourly rate: $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, his hourly rate increased by $0.50, so his new rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, his hourly rate increased by $1.00, so his final rate is $11.50 per hour.
   - If Billy works 20 hours, his earnings are: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her starting rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - If Sally works 20 hours, her earnings are: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is: $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's calculate how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount, so:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the 30 hours required.

First, let's calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
- So, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours played in the following week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total hours played in the following week = 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, let's add the hours played in both periods:
- Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total hours played from the 30 hours required to find out how many more hours Kris needs to play:
- Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

1. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
   \[4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}\]

2. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
   \[16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}\]

3. Adding the tea consumed by both groups of students gives us the total amount of tea consumed:
   \[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

4. We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
   \[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons."
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after his second order and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies after the second order: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200 candies
Candies sold: 150

Candies still to be sold: 200 (total) - 150 (sold) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

Let's denote the number of students at the beginning of the year as \( S_0 = 10 \).

At the end of each month, the number of students doubles. So, the number of students at the end of each month can be calculated as follows:

- End of January: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_0 = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
- End of February: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_1 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
- End of March: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
- End of April: \( S_4 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 80 = 160 \)
- End of May: \( S_5 = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 160 = 320 \)

Now, to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = \( S_5 - S_0 = 320 - 10 = 310 \)

Therefore, by the end of May, 310 additional students would have joined above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Sum of all petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
   - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
   - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
   - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

4. **Total Petals Dropped:**
   - Sum of petals dropped: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

5. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

**Final Answer:**
79 petals in total are on the flowers in the vase."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Marshmallows**: The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows Used by John and DeSean**: John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores. So, they used a total of \(9 + 9 = 18\) marshmallows.
3. **Marshmallows Dropped**: They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.
4. **Marshmallows Left**: To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract the marshmallows used and dropped from the total:
   \[
   35 - 18 - 3 = 14
   \]
5. **Marshmallows per Kid**: Since the remaining marshmallows are to be shared equally between John and DeSean, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long as Jack is \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters each of these two friends uses is \( \frac{120}{10} = 12 \) quarters.
   - The total game time for the better friend is \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters the better friend uses is \( \frac{8}{20} = 0.4 \) quarters.

3. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - Each of the two friends who play half as long as Jack uses 12 quarters, so together they use \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) quarters.
   - The better friend uses 0.4 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 24 + 0.4 = 36.4 \) quarters.

Since quarters are typically used in whole numbers, we can round 36.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 36 quarters.

**Final Answer:**
36 quarters are used."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is denoted as \( s \) ounces. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil is denoted as \( o \) ounces. According to the problem, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so \( o = 2s \). Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express the amount of oil in terms of \( z \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \]

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation for the total amount of the ingredients:
\[ o + s + z + s + z = 10 \]
Substituting \( o = 4z \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + 2z + z + 2z + z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z = 1 \), we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats at $500 each.
- The total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows at $1500 each.
- The total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Therefore, John spent a total of 4500 dollars."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with:

\[ 16 \text{ cars} \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days: \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes: \( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund = 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And she buys a bag for $20. The total cost of her purchases is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

1. First week: 8,000 bars
2. Second week: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
3. Third week: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, to find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract it from the monthly production.

Total production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars

Production in the fourth week:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production in the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up for four weeks.

1. **Video Recording Time:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly video recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly video recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Song Writing Time:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Monthly song writing time = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Makeup Time:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll use minutes for all calculations.

- Monthly video recording time = 288 minutes.
- Monthly song writing time = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Monthly makeup time = 360 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 minutes (video recording) + 480 minutes (song writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - Angela needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - Angela needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Cost for 2 additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
   - Cost for 1 additional chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
   - Cost for 10 additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

4. **Total Additional Cost**: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

**Final Answer:**
The total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Use Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy has saved 12 dollars more than Anthony. Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos and the distance they travel. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, we can denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of each kangaroo as \(S\). The total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:

\[ D = 3 \times S \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

We need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Let's denote the time it takes for the turtles as \(T\). The distance \(D\) can also be expressed as:

\[ D = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]

Since both expressions represent the same distance \(D\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = 2 \times S \times T \]

We can cancel \(S\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(S \neq 0\)):

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times T \]

\[ 54 = 2 \times T \]

Solving for \(T\):

\[ T = \frac{54}{2} \]

\[ T = 27 \]

So, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total number of dishes = \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\)

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount should be equal to the reduced price of the laptop minus the extra $50 she still needs:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Combining like terms on the left side:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in her purse."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Adam has 3 large apples.
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Adam has 5 small apples.
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Now, we add the slices from both large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
- Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
- Total slices = \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
- Slices left = total slices - slices eaten
- Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Adding these unused lengths together:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals:

4 * $20 = $80

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has $40 in total.

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so he spends:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so he spends:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount spent is:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given the information:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes

= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are not good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
20 (total students) - 13 (neither math only nor English only) = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (both math only and both math and English):
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total concert time is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
- Time available for groups: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form
- Time (T) = 3 years

Now, let's calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

**White shirts without collars**:
- Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining white shirts without collars are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts without buttons**:
- Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts without buttons are \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

**Difference between floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars**:
- The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
- The number of white shirts without collars is 20.
- The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

Now, if he sells each tray for $2.5, the total earnings will be:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats on each farm.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total number of goats left.

Step 1: Goats sold
- From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Step 2: Remaining goats
- Farm X initially had 55 goats. After selling 10, the remaining goats are 55 - 10 = 45 goats.
- Farm Y initially had 45 goats. After selling 20, the remaining goats are 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

Step 3: Total remaining goats
- The total number of goats left in both farms is 45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats.

Therefore, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food, taking into account the $2 discount for each basket of red food.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is 123 dollars."

"Let's denote your age as \( x \).

Since you are three years younger than your brother, your brother's age is \( x + 3 \).

You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( x - 2 \).

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Therefore, the total number of glue sticks needed is \(27 \times 2 = 54\).

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack: \(54 \div 8 = 6.75\).
- Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7.
- Additionally, he wants to have some extra glue sticks, so buying 7 packs will ensure he has enough.

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:

\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:

\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. 

In one hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so for 10 loaves, she has:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$40.00 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has:

70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins.

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos = 600.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520.
- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. **Blue Cars**: There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Total number of red, green, and blue cars is \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\).

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is the total number of cars minus the number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Yellow cars: \(75 - 52 = 23\).

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Final numerical answer:
Fawn has 28 books."

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones and then subtract this from the $4000 given to the seller.

The cost of one phone is $700, so the cost of 5 phones is:
\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000 to the electronics seller. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate the total amount each person pays per month and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly amount.

1. Calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Total cost per month = $400.
   - Madeline's monthly payment = 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240.

2. Calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month:
   - Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   - Keenan's monthly payment = Total cost - Madeline's payment = $400 - $240 = $160.

3. Calculate the amount Keenan spends per week:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Keenan's weekly payment = Keenan's monthly payment / 4 = $160 / 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizza pieces Tobias ate each day and then sum them up.

1. **First Day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Second Day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces.

3. **Third Day:**
   After the first two days, the remaining pieces are:

Next, we calculate the cost of one bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (3 \times 3.00) + (2 \times 2.00) = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48, so after buying the bolts, he will have:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
The selling price per chicken is $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.
Isaias makes a profit of $2000.
\[ \text{Total cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for a total of $7000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade.
2. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32.
3. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, let's denote the number of glasses Micah sold as \( M \) and Mitchell also sold \( M \) glasses.

So, the equation for the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ 14 + M + M = 32 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 14 + 2M = 32 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
2. Determine the cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
- The rope is 20 meters long.
- The price per meter is $2.
- Therefore, the total amount of money Sarah will get is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40\).

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope.
- The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
- Since Sarah is buying a rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost of the new rope is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30\).

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope.
- The money Sarah has after selling the rope is $40.
- The cost of the new rope is $30.
- Therefore, the money Sarah will have left over is \( \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the information given:
1. In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
2. In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each time he hired her.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns:
- From Joe's lawn: \( 6J \) dollars
- From Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars
- From Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars

The total amount earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings last month were $80. Therefore, the amount she made from mowing lawns plus the amount she made from lemonade sales equals $80:
\[ 54J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80 \]

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we need to determine the value of \( J \). Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54J \), and the total earnings are $80, we can set up the equation:
\[ 54J = 80 - \text{(lemonade sales)} \]

However, we need to find \( J \) first. Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is $54J and the total earnings are $80, we can solve for \( J \) by assuming the simplest case where the remaining amount is from lemonade sales. If we assume \( J = 1 \) (the simplest non-zero value), then:
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
So, the amount from lemonade sales would be:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To find the weight of Harry, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is \(55 + 16 = 71\) kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is \(71 + 8 = 79\) kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is \(79 - 5 = 74\) kg.

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out each month.
2. Calculate his total earnings from renting the car.
3. Subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented out each month
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Total earnings
John gets paid $25 an hour.
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Step 3: Calculate profit
Subtract the car payment from the total earnings.
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance both of them rowed is the sum of the distances each of them rowed, which is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

Total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis: 110 miles."
"Susan initially made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies to be divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

\[ \frac{96}{6} = 16 \]

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left. Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup equally between them.

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets.
- There are 9 movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Step 2: Calculate the average price per ticket.
- Deepa has spent $216 in total.
- The total number of tickets is 27.
- The average price per ticket is \(\frac{216}{27} = 8\).

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of 9 is:
9 * (1/3) = 3 red shoe boxes.

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 
1/5 of 30 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total he started with:
\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age, and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

So, the equation based on the given information is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm first:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

To find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the sizes of both farms together:

200 acres (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 acres (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres."
"Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8.00 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would earn 8 * $8.00 = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Time taken for a normal Sudoku puzzle:**
   - John takes 45 minutes to solve a normal Sudoku puzzle.

2. **Time taken for an extreme Sudoku puzzle:**
   - An extreme Sudoku takes 4 times the time of a normal Sudoku.
   - Therefore, the time taken for an extreme Sudoku is \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.

3. **Total time spent on both puzzles:**
   - The total time spent is the sum of the time taken for the normal Sudoku and the extreme Sudoku.
   - Total time = \(45 + 180 = 225\) minutes.

4. **Rate of drinking water:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in half an hour, there are \(60 / 2 = 30\) minutes.
   - Therefore, John drinks one bottle of water every 30 minutes.

5. **Number of bottles of water John drinks in 225 minutes:**
   - To find out how many bottles he drinks, we divide the total time by the time it takes to drink one bottle.
   - Number of bottles = \(225 / 30 = 7.5\).

Since John cannot drink half a bottle, we consider the practical scenario where he would drink 7 full bottles and start a new one, but the question asks for the final numerical answer, which is:

7.5 bottles.

Final numerical answer:
7.5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is \(20 \times 2 = 40\).

3. **Determine the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Since 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, the remaining pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is \(58 - 40 = 18\).

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna. If 18 pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, then the number of yellow balloons is \(18 \div 3 = 6\).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

**Final numerical answer:**

"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours in these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

1. There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, which totals \(16 + 22 = 38\) students playing soccer.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of students:

\[6 + 12 + 38 = 56\]

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit made from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices of bread per day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices of bread per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

\]

The loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, there are 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are 4.5 chamomile cups and 4.5 mint tea cups if we were to divide them equally. However, since we cannot have half a cup, we need to consider that the total number of cups in each row must be an integer. The only way to have equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is to have 4 chamomile cups and 5 mint tea cups, or 5 chamomile cups and 4 mint tea cups, in each row, which would still sum up to 9 cups per row.

Since the problem does not specify which type of tea gets the extra cup, we can assume either configuration. For the sake of this problem, let's assume 4 chamomile and 5 mint tea cups in each row.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ 5 \]

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

First, we calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in 2 trips:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is:

12 berries/trip"
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, after 6 days, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank is:

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday through Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
62 (total toys) - 48 (blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is 50 years."
"Maria invited 4 friends, so including herself, there are 5 people in total.

At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons.

Adding all the balloons together: 8 (initial) + 1 (Maria's) + 15 (from mom) = 24 total balloons.

The girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already own, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so the total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these totals.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants:
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine produces in a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = Widgets per hour * Hours per day * Days in a month
   - Total widgets in a month = 60 * 24 * 30

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = Widgets per hour * Hours per day * Days in a month
   - Total widgets in a month = 45 * 24 * 30

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:

- Price per widget: $6

3. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Revenue = Total widgets * Price per widget
   - Revenue = (60 * 24 * 30) * 6

4. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Revenue = Total widgets * Price per widget
   - Revenue = (45 * 24 * 30) * 6

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000

Let's do the calculations:

1. **Total widgets produced by Widgeteer 3000:**
   - 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets

2. **Total widgets produced by WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets

3. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
   - 43,200 * 6 = $259,200

4. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - 32,400 * 6 = $194,400

5. **Difference in revenue:**
   - $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

First, he pays for the initial 12-hour stay at 1000 pesos.

For the additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours initial stay), he pays 70 pesos per hour. So, the cost for the additional hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron's stay, including the initial 12 hours and the additional 5 hours, is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his actual stay from the cost of a 24-hour stay:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the hay requirement for each type of animal and then sum these amounts.

1. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
2. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the hay requirement for each sheep as follows:
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this, which is \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Now, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep:
- For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\).
- For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\).

Adding these together gives the total hay needed:
\[75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining money is:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled out after ten rounds.

First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out:
- Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each.
- Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is \(20 \times 15 = 300\).

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out:
- Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig.
- Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is \(300 + 50 = 350\).

Now, we can calculate the total number of letters both have spelled out after the ten rounds:
- The total number of letters is \(300 + 350 = 650\).

Final numerical answer:
650"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons.
2. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.
3. Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles are left for herself.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice from coupons.
The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.
There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice.
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has.
\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours
3. The parts charge: $60

First, we calculate the labor charge. Since the charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply 2.25 by $35:

\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Next, we add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge:

\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is:

\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

However, since he only sold 5 CDs, and the total cost for 10 CDs was $90, the amount he was out after selling 5 CDs is calculated as follows:

The cost of the 5 CDs he sold:

\[ \frac{5}{10} \times \$90 = \$45 \]

The money he received from selling the 5 CDs:

\[ \$200 \]

The net amount he was out is the initial cost minus the money he received from selling the CDs:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means he actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money but gained $110.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$110 \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up the totals:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the time he rests.
4. Determine the remaining distance and the new swimming speed.
5. Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining distance.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes to swim that distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time he rests:**
   He rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance and the new swimming speed:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]
   His new swimming speed is half of his original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Sum up all the times to get the total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find out how many loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is 10% of $5, which is \(0.10 \times 5 = 0.50\) dollars.

For 6 copies, the total commission is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3\) dollars.

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is \(0.08 \times 15 = 1.20\) dollars.

For 10 copies, the total commission is \(10 \times 1.20 = 12\) dollars.

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- The total commission is the sum of the commissions from both newspapers.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = \(3 + 12 = 15\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. B + A + D = 45 (since the total points scored by the team is 45)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second and third equations to express A and D in terms of B:
- A = B - 20
- D = B - 10

Substituting these into the first equation, we get:
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get:
3B - 30 = 45

Adding 30 to both sides, we get:
3B = 75

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
B = 25

Now, we can find A by substituting B back into the equation A = B - 20:
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Azibo scored 5 points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of paper thickness.
- Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, meaning one side of a sheet corresponds to one page in the book.

Since there are 100 pages per inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

Therefore, the book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many reports he can staple per minute.
3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ reports}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 2 \text{ reports/minute} \]

With this rate, we can now calculate the total number of reports stapled in 900 minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ reports/minute} \times 900 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Asleep:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Converting 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Sleep on Bed Duration:**
   - Subtract the sleepwalking time from the total time Kim was asleep.
   - \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equal 24. Therefore, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

Given that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he originally has:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied beds initially is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - The number of unoccupied beds initially is \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, there are 200 occupied beds.
   - After 2 weeks, an additional 700 patients are admitted.
   - Therefore, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - With 900 beds occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

3 years * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, then Shawna's father is:

9 years * 5 = 45 years old.

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert by finding the original number before the 20% increase.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to the information given, Courtney reported 48 people, which is 120% of the actual number (100% + 20% overstatement).

So, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Let's say Jeffrey carried \( J \) balls. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are told that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the ratio of the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball, and Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) balls. This means that \( J = 1 \).

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls equation:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. After the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so four times that is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so together they got:
   \[70 + 70 = 140\]

2. Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins got as \(C\). According to the problem, Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so:
   \[C = 70 + 15 = 85\]

3. Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips each person got:
   \[140 + 85 = 225\]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost.

Step 1: The cost of the supplies is given as $400.

Step 2: The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the supplies. To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]
So, the cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Step 3: Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is $1000."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:
147"
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. Her friends at home had 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting for her.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made: 12
- Brownies received from office: 6
- Brownies received from friends: 48

Total brownies before the surprise party: \(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\)

During the surprise party, 18 brownies were eaten, so we subtract that from the total:

Brownies left: \(66 - 18 = 48\)

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: 3 * 15 = 45 minutes

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: 5 * 22 = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: 4 * 18 = 72 minutes

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to restring all the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 8 * 1/4 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting this value into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together gives us the total cost of the books:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the number of boxes sold on each day for both gingerbread and apple pie.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday for each item.

For gingerbread on Sunday:
\[ \text{Gingerbread on Sunday} = \text{Gingerbread on Saturday} + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ boxes} \]

For apple pie on Sunday:
\[ \text{Apple pie on Sunday} = 15 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
\[ \text{Total gingerbread} = \text{Gingerbread on Saturday} + \text{Gingerbread on Sunday} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

**Total apple pie sold:**
\[ \text{Total apple pie} = \text{Apple pie on Saturday} + \text{Apple pie on Sunday} = (10 - 4) + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each item.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
\[ \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = \text{Total gingerbread} \times \text{Price per box} = 25 \times 6 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Earnings from apple pie:**
\[ \text{Earnings from apple pie} = \text{Total apple pie} \times \text{Price per box} = 21 \times 15 = 315 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to get the total earnings for the two days.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from gingerbread} + \text{Earnings from apple pie} = 150 + 315 = 465 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of 465 dollars for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- The vacation lasts for 8 days.

So, the total amount of sunscreen used is:
\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, we determine how many bottles are needed:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.

To find the number of bottles required, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount in each bottle:
\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The blue car costs $100.

Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is:

$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

Both cars cost $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Current Age of Emil**: Emil is currently 19 years old.

2. **Age of Emil in 5 Years**: In 5 years, Emil will be 19 + 5 = 24 years old.

3. **Age of Emil's Dad in 5 Years**: When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old in 5 years.

4. **Current Age of Emil's Dad**: Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, his current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

5. **Age of Emil's Brother in 5 Years**: When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old in 5 years.

6. **Current Age of Emil's Brother**: Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, his current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

7. **Sum of the Ages of Emil's Dad and Brother Now**: The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

**Final Answer**: The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30 students:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this number by calculating 25% of 24:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is 12."
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Sophie's size} + \text{Charlie's size}}{2} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of plants needed to fill the flower bed and then determine the cost based on the number of plants Pat needs to buy.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet, we'll keep the measurements in feet.

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.

The total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants Pat needs to buy is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times \$6/\text{plant} = \$162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar does. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants for all 5 hanging baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00. So, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- Each basket will also have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. So, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs for one basket:
- Total cost for one basket = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, we need to multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
- Total cost for 5 baskets = \(14 \times 5 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend a total of 70 dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets.

70"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with that amount each month.
3. Calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year.

First, let's find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $500.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00. Since $500.00 is less than the cost of one pair of shoes, she cannot buy any pairs of shoes with that amount each month.

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since the peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks together:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Cooling effect: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
- Warming effect: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).

The net temperature change is:
\[18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\].

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14 degrees.**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - So, the first plane goes to France and Germany for one-quarter of its flights each.

3. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - One-quarter of the first plane's 88 flights are to France.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \(88 \times \frac{1}{4} = 22\).

The final numerical answer is:
22"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total howling time in seconds = \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

\(30 - 18 = 12\)

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
- Alessandro's age \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\)
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is 3."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is the sum of $500 and $1500.

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund. So, we multiply the total amount by 3.

\[ 2000 \times 3 = 6000 \]

However, before the lawyer makes the donation, Walter's friend also donates $200. This does not affect the lawyer's donation amount, as the lawyer's donation is based on the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not on the final total including the friend's donation.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6000 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \). The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

First, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.

Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.

Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments into hours:
- Total time for inpatient rounds = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.
- Total time for appointments = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the 9 hours available:
- Time left to update records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes. So, she needs to start frosting 10 minutes before 5:00 pm, which is 4:50 pm.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours. Therefore, she needs to start cooling the cake 2 hours before 4:50 pm, which is 2:50 pm.
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes. So, she needs to start baking 30 minutes before 2:50 pm, which is 2:20 pm.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes. Therefore, she needs to start making the cake batter 20 minutes before 2:20 pm, which is 2:00 pm.

Thus, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. So, \( 4P = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. So, \( 7M = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( P \) and \( M \):

\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the original population to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the number of baby porcupines to the original population to find the total number of porcupines after a year.
\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ G = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.**

The cost per gallon is $0.10, so the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ C = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. Red sticks: 9
2. Blue sticks: 5 more than red sticks, so 9 + 5 = 14
3. Yellow sticks: 3 less than blue sticks, so 14 - 3 = 11

Now, we add them all together:

9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

Therefore, they have 34 sticks in total."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. The amount she needs to save is:
\[ 20\% \times \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept two packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Anne has 10 friends and she gave the sweets equally, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the original price of $120 for each of the three years.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.

After the first year, the price \( P_1 \) will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 \]

After the second year, the price \( P_2 \) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.05) = (120 \times 1.05) \times 1.05 = 120 \times (1.05)^2 \]

After the third year, the price \( P_3 \) will be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 + 0.05) = (120 \times (1.05)^2) \times 1.05 = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):
\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

So, the price after three years is:
\[ P_3 = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:
\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then figure out how many of those are selfies and portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally among 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8 to find out how many pictures are in each album:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are for selfies only and 2 of the albums are for portraits only. This means there are 3 albums with only selfies and 2 albums with only portraits, totaling 5 albums that are either selfies or portraits. Since there are 8 albums in total, the remaining 3 albums must contain a mix of selfies and portraits.

However, the question asks for the total number of portraits and selfies, not the distribution among the albums. Since 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits as follows:

- Total selfies: \(3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}\)
- Total portraits: \(2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}\)

Adding these together gives us the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion based on the rate of reading.

If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 18 pages (which is 6 times more) will take 6 times as long.

10 minutes * 6 = 60 minutes

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests after early checkout: 100 - 24 = 76
- Guests after late checkout: 76 - 15 = 61

"First, let's break down the quiz into its components:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24
- Number of average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we have:
  - Number of average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
  - Number of difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions:
  - Number of easy questions Aries gets correct: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions:
  - Number of average questions Aries gets correct: 18 / 2 = 9
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions:
  - Number of difficult questions Aries gets correct: 18 / 2 = 9

Adding these up gives the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Total correct answers: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( L \):
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family per day is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."

Therefore, Suzanne has \(\$300\) left from her earnings."
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

30 (first twin) + 30 (second twin) = 60 eggs

This means that the remaining eggs, excluding the 10 that were not found, were found by their friends. To find out how many eggs the friends found, we subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the unfound eggs from the total:

100 (total eggs) - 60 (found by Smith twins) - 10 (unfound) = 30 eggs

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes.
3. Calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days) with steel pickaxes.

Step 1: Ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe
- A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Step 2: Ore mined by 40 dwarves in a day
- If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, then 40 dwarves can mine 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

Step 3: Ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month (30 days)
- If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then in 30 days they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- 8 sandwiches at $1.50 each
- Cost = 8 * $1.50 = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she approached the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.8.

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 1.0 = 0.5\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, giving an extension, and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension, and having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 94%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests.
3. Divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for guests: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (graduates and faculty) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use that to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \).

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

**Step 2: Determine the total time.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is 8 intervals * 5 seconds/interval = 40 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds."
"Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, and each box contains forty apples. Therefore, the total number of apples he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ apples/box} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

He plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor buys and then subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total cost:
- The total cost of the cheese is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the $50 Amor started with to find out how much money she has left:
- The amount of money left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

Therefore, Amor will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working during those four years.

1. **Total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a job earning $25,000 per year before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Total money spent on college and lost income:**
   - Total money spent = Total borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Income after college:**
   - With a college degree, Jim's income is tripled.
   - His new income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

5. **Time to earn back the total money spent:**
   - To find out how long it will take to earn back $300,000 at an annual income of $75,000, we divide the total money spent by the annual income.
   - Time to earn back = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, we sum up the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[
425 + 102 + 209 = 736
\]

Therefore, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad
- Each pasta salad costs $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6.00/person = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for both types of salads:
- Total cost = Cost of chicken salad + Cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America: There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.

3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

The share of the first person is $420."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
3. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

Step 1: Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
- The painters worked for 3 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
- The painters worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.
- There are 24 hours in a day.
- Therefore, the number of hours worked per day by the team is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.
- Since they worked for 21 days, the total number of hours worked by the team is \(9 \times 21 = 189\) hours.

Step 3: Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.
- There are 4 painters.
- Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked is \(\frac{189}{4} = 47.25\) hours.

Final numerical answer:
Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means that each year the car is worth 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the value of the car in 2010 step by step:

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   - Initial value in 2007: $20,000
   - Value in 2008: $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   - Value in 2008: $15,800
   - Value in 2009: $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,482

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   - Value in 2009: $12,482
   - Value in 2010: $12,482 * 0.79 = $9,849.78

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,849.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German.

1. Half of the 50 books are written in English:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ books in English}
   \]

2. 10% of the 50 books are written in German:
   \[
   0.10 \times 50 = 5 \text{ books in German}

1955 kilometers (total distance) - 325 kilometers (distance already driven) = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank Top**: $10
2. **Running Shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis Shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic Socks**: Package originally $8, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Tank Top: $10
- Running Shorts: $15
- Tennis Shoes: $24
- Athletic Socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt per tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles is \$2400."
"To find out how much James pays for his insurance a year after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Calculate the total annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and the insurance cost increased by 60% due to the accident. To find 60% of $120, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Increased Cost} = \text{Normal Cost} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Increased Cost} = 120 \times \left(1 + \frac{60}{100}\right) = 120 \times 1.60 = 192 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $192.

Next, we calculate the total annual cost by multiplying the increased monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Increased Monthly Cost} \times 12 = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses and then figure out how many loads that equates to based on the machine's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets used per week is \(4 + 1 = 5\) sheets.

2. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets used in a year is \(5 \times 52 = 260\) sheets.

3. **Determine the number of loads of laundry needed:**
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.
   - Since each twin set consists of 2 sheets, 2 twin sets equal \(2 \times 2 = 4\) sheets.
   - Therefore, each load can wash \(4 + 1 = 5\) sheets.
   - To find out how many loads are needed for 260 sheets, we divide 260 by 5: \(260 \div 5 = 52\).

So, Greg does 52 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which means they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of:
4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

If they continue this pattern for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is:
6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and then sum them up.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, the total number of stickers he had at the end of last year is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year. Therefore, the number of stickers he collected this year is:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
4. Adding the stickers collected this year to the total from last year gives us the current total number of stickers in his collection:
   \[
   150 + 100 = 250
   \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats each day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of cat food:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.

So, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams per cat per day} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes (which is half an hour, so we divide the hourly rate by 2)
   \[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
3. Painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
   \[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \]
4. Parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \]

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as follows:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. **Glee Club:**
   - Ordered 20 pizzas.
   - Ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. **Football Team:**
   - Ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
   - Ate 80% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. **Total Pizzas Eaten:**
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (by glee club) + 32 (by football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. **Total Pizzas Ordered:**
   - Total pizzas ordered = 20 (by glee club) + 40 (by football team) = 60 pizzas.

5. **Pizzas Left:**
   - Pizzas left = Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten = 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing both the small and big coupons.

First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon:
- Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons.
- He is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he sends out \(2 \times 700 = 1400\) big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon:
- The cost to mail one small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for 700 small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.
- The cost to mail one big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for 1400 big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent on postage:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons
- Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. One meatball sub contains 4 meatballs.
2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches left.
4. Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, so Sidney now has \(3 + 3 = 6\) meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.

Step 1: Determine the number of trucks with mechanical failures.
A quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
Since 5 trucks had mechanical failures, the remaining trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser are:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.
Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the cost for the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, we can consider the purchase in sets of 2 pounds (since the promotion applies to every two pounds). So, we have 3 sets of 2 pounds.

The cost for the first pound in each set is $4.00, and the second pound is $2.00. Therefore, the cost for each set of 2 pounds is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds, which is 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost is 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"To determine the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who could not come.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of additional guests.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the number of guests who could not come:
- 4 people said they could not come.

So, the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

Now, we calculate the cost. The theater rental fee is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the theater rental fee to the cost of the additional guests gives us the total cost:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her initial amount. We can set up the equation for Maggie as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial amount, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80. Since she spent a quarter of it, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

Therefore, Maggie has $60 left.

Next, we consider Riza. Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her initial amount. We can set up the equation for Riza as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial amount} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial amount, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial amount} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90. Since she spent one-third of it, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, Riza has $60 left.

Now, we add the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

So, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}\]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
   \[10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}\]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas}\]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas}\]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315, which is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week. So, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}\]

5. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
   \[147 \text{ bananas} \div 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses would be:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist does not have the exact amount in dollar bills, so they will use quarters for the change. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

20 quarters"

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and then figure out how many more she needs to save.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of toothpicks saved is \(10 \times 12 = 120\).

2. Determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to save to reach 200:
   - She needs 200 toothpicks in total.
   - She has already saved 120 toothpicks.
   - Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is \(200 - 120 = 80\).

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - To find out how many weeks it will take to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: \(80 \div 10 = 8\).

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers paid is \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\) dollars.

2. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   - Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for is \(1500 \times 1.20 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is $1800.
   - The discount is the difference between the original price and the price paid by the friend, which is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the percentage discount:**
   - The percentage discount is calculated as \(\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original Price}} \times 100\).
   - Substituting the values, we get \(\frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%\).

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, 1 spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If 1 spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Let's denote Binkie's score as \( B \) and Frankie's score as \( F \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ B = 90 \]
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( F \):
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. In total, he walks 4 miles (2 miles to the halfway point and 2 miles back home).

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes for him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches.

Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.

Cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches.

Cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Finally, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
Savings = Cost for 40 bananas individually - Cost for 10 bunches
Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.50 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

Now, we calculate the earnings:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings:

Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour, and then determine the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
3. The net number of bales left in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Now, we calculate the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:

\[2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales}\]

So, after 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of classes John takes in a week:**
   - Normal classes: 6 periods/day * 5 days/week = 30 periods/week
   - Extra classes: 2 classes/day * 5 days/week = 10 classes/week
   - Total classes: 30 + 10 = 40 classes/week

2. **Calculate the total time spent in classes each week:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Total time in classes: 40 classes/week * 40 minutes/class = 1600 minutes/week

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning.
   - Total weekly minutes: 1600 minutes
   - Extra learning time: 1600 minutes * (1/16) = 100 minutes

4. **Calculate the total learning time in minutes:**
   - Total learning time: 1600 minutes (classes) + 100 minutes (extra learning) = 1700 minutes

5. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Total learning time in hours: 1700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the height the ball bounces to on the first bounce.
2. Use that height to calculate the height of the second bounce.

First bounce height:
The ball is dropped from a height of 24 feet. Since it bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Second bounce height:
The ball then bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]
\[ \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the ball goes to a height of \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet, or approximately 10.67 feet, on its second bounce.

Final numerical answer:
\(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet."
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned a total of $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas.
4. After Ellen's brother takes his sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas left.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right) \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives us the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy can help based on his working hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days (from the 1st to the 19th).

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

### Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works
Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works on 80% of the days.

Number of days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy can help
Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

**Final Answer:**
Billy helps 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
480"

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to ride the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to ride the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on his lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the value of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Frying pan: The original price is $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. So, the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Therefore, the sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Set of towels: The original price is $30.00, and it is on sale for 10% off. So, the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Therefore, the sale price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a 20-year retirement period, and it will take her 40 years to save the necessary amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years beyond her planned retirement period.

"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by using the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the total number of heels:
\[3 + 3 = 6\] heels.

Now, we calculate the average height of the heels by dividing the total height by the number of heels:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to determine how many miles she must hike each day.

First, we need to know the number of days in June, which is 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles she plans to walk each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to complete her journey, we divide the total miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her journey on time. We subtract the number of miles she plans to walk each day from the number of miles she needs to walk each day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much each of the books cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna has spent in total.
2. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, we know Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchase. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each of the books cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

50 students + 10 students = 60 students

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks and then use that rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, we find the rate of blinking:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
- Therefore, the rate of blinking is \( \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \).

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
- If the light blinks 51 times per minute, then to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51.
- \( \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's pond, and then add the new ones he buys.

Initial count:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After buying more:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:

Total male fishes = Male guppies + Male goldfishes = 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fishes = Female guppies + Female goldfishes = 8 + 8 = 16

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, but to be sure, we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, let's add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Calculate the total distance for a round trip.
3. Determine the total distance driven in a month.

**Step 1: Calculate the one-way distance.**

John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph. The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the one-way distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance for a round trip.**

Since a round trip includes both the trip to his parents' house and the return trip, the total distance for one visit is:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total distance driven in a month.**

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance driven in a month is:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
\[ 560 \, \text{miles} \]"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the total production of the first four workers per hour is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he gave to Kris were the other half. This means Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the 32 stickers Luis had were half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate its speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph} = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can use the second and third pieces of information to find the number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah. We substitute \(C = S + 12\) into \(C + S = 30\):

\[
(S + 12) + S = 30
\]
\[
2S + 12 = 30
\]
\[
2S = 18
\]
\[
S = 9
\]

Now, we can find \(C\):

\[
C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
\]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline together with Camden and Sarah painted 56 eggs. Since \(A = M\), we can write:

\[
A + M + C + S = 56
\]
\[
2A + 21 + 9 = 56
\]
\[
2A + 30 = 56
\]
\[
2A = 26
\]
\[
A = 13
\]

Since \(A = M = 13\), we now know that Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:

\[
C - A = 21 - 13 = 8
\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the length of the logs John can get from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, which is:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles, given the information about her walking speeds and the time spent on the beach.

First, let's find out how long it takes her to walk on the beach and on the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - We are given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach.
   - Distance on the beach: 2 miles.

2. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Let the speed on the beach be \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so \( 40 = \frac{2}{v} \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

3. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, so it is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.
   - Distance on the sidewalk: 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \) minutes.

4. **Total time for the walk:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Jane has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.
So, the total amount saved so far is \(4 \times 8 = 32\) dollars.

Step 2: To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save.
The remaining amount needed is \(60 - 32 = 28\) dollars.

Step 3: Since Jane saves $4 each week, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take.
The number of weeks needed is \(28 \div 4 = 7\) weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each tree.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 + 8 + 3 = 32

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his current marbles. Since Bob currently has 36 marbles, if he loses 10, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
26"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in three weeks:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

6. **Total chickens added in three weeks:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

7. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of men and women on the bus initially, and then subtract the number of women who alight from the bus.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

\[14x = 84\]

\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\), and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold per day.
4. Multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3 to get the total for 3 days.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sunflower sales per day:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earned $26 from sunflower sales per day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Bouquet sales per day:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earned $56 from bouquet sales per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.
   - Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets = 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

3. **Total sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from sunflower sales + Sunflowers from bouquets = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

4. **Total sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Calculate how many rocks he sells (60% of his inventory).
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the cost of the rocks he sold.
5. Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the cost.

Step 1: Determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
Adam can buy rocks for $5 each. So, with $100, he can buy:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Step 2: Calculate how many rocks he sells (60% of his inventory).
60% of 20 rocks is:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
Adam sells each rock for $7, so the revenue from selling 12 rocks is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the rocks he sold.
The cost of each rock is $5, so the cost of 12 rocks is:
\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 5: Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the cost.
The loss is the cost of the rocks sold minus the revenue from selling them:
\[ 60 - 84 = -24 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Adam actually makes a profit of $24, not a loss. However, the question asks for the loss, and since there is no loss, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. May has 31 days.

To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we can calculate it as follows:

1. Daily cost for all fish: \(3 \text{ fish} \times \$1/\text{fish} = \$3\)
2. Monthly cost: \(31 \text{ days} \times \$3/\text{day} = \$93\)

So, Jen spends \(\$93\) on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave away 24 roses, so she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then she bought 15 more roses, so she had:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket. 

Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, we can express this as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60 or 60%.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening independently:

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets being winners} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[ 0.12 \times 100\% = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \]

Now, let's calculate the total profit from selling all 6 devices:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per device} \times \text{Total number of devices} = 20 \times 6 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Dressing the octuplets**:
   - 3/4 of the octuplets are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
   - 1/4 of the octuplets are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

3. **Wearing bows**:
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

4. **Total number of bow-wearers**:
   - Blue-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Purple-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Total bow-wearers: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

5. **Percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Total number of bow-wearers: 4
   - Probability: \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Percentage: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \)

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

Now, let's calculate the reports received on Wednesday:

5168 (total reports) - 1907 (Monday and Tuesday) - 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.

First, he sells half of the land:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]
He sells this for $50.

Next, he sells another 1/4 of his original land:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]
He sells this for $30.

Now, we calculate the remaining land after these sales:
\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]
He sells the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of money he earns, we add up all the sales:
\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, after selling all his unused land, Abraham will be able to earn:

"To find Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then the number of face masks he uses in one day is:

2 changes/go out * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

For 2 days, the number of face masks he uses is:

6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Adding this to the combined total of the first two complexes gives us the number of apartments in the third complex:

\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1248 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, \(x = 1000\).
6. An 8-year-old tree, therefore, produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
7. A 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
8. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = \(50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550\)

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2550."

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let the amount of money each gave to their little sister be \(x\):**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money, so we can write the equation: \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - First, calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie gave \(x = 3\) dollars to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box.
3. Determine how many pods you can get for $1 in the special size box.
4. Calculate how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the pods you can get for $1.

### Step 1: Determine the number of pods in the special size box
A regular box contains 100 pods. The special size box has 20% more pods than a regular box. So, the number of pods in the special size box is:
\[ 100 + (100 \times 0.20) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box
The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. So, the cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many pods you can get for $1 in the special size box
If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the pods you can get for $1
Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the 10 pods you can get for $1.

**Final numerical answer:**

"Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he withdraws, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas has 50 $20 bills.

He loses 10 of these bills while getting home, so he has:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 $20 bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 $20 bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is 55% of the original length.

\[ \text{Remaining chalk after Monday} = 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk.

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to be reduced to less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the length of the chalk after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). We start with \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches and each day the chalk is reduced by 20%, so the length after \( n \) days is:

\[ L_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( L_n < 2 \).

\[ 2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2 \]

Dividing both sides by 2.75:

\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]

\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]

\[ n \ln(0.8) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]

Since \(\ln(0.8)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.8)\) and reverse the inequality:

\[ n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.8)} \]

Calculating the values:

\[ \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.3365 \]
\[ \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231 \]

\[ n > \frac{-0.3365}{-0.2231} \approx 1.508 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls on varsity, and then subtract these from the total number of boys and girls.

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity:
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \).

3. Calculate the total number of students on varsity:
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = \( 4 + 3 = 7 \).

4. Calculate the total number of students not on varsity:
   - Total students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity.
   - Total number of students = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24.
   - Total students not on varsity = \( 24 - 7 = 17 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then calculate what percentage of James' total teeth this represents.

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

Now, to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
2. Calculate the refund based on the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.
\[ \text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: Calculate the refund.
The cost per gallon is $3.5, so the refund amount is:
\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

1800"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples, so he now has 2 apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground, making a total of 6 apples.
3. Newton picked up these 6 apples, so now he has 6 apples in his pocket.
4. Newton put all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground, making a total of 6 apples.
5. Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground, making a total of 11 apples.
6. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples, so now he has 11 apples in his pocket.

Therefore, Newton brought home 11 apples."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bags
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times \$18/\text{bag} = \$306 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for these slices:
- For the cheese pizza, since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \( \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).
- For the pepperoni pizza, since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \( \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\).

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total is:
3 miles/day × 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total is:
5 miles/day × 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days together:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay builds in an hour is the number he builds minus the number that melt, which is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net number of snowballs built per hour. So, \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we subtract 20 years from John's current age, we can find out how old he was when Digimon came out:
   \[
   28 - 20 = 8
   \]
   So, John was 8 years old when Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim must have been half of that age:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time:
   \[
   4 + 20 = 24
   \]

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices each one ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down day by day and calculate the number of bandages used and ordered each day.

**Day 1:**
- Bandages used: 38
- Bandages ordered: 50 (one bulk pack)
- Bandages at the end of Day 1: 50 (ordered) - 38 (used) = 12

**Day 2:**
- Bandages used: 38 - 10 = 28
- Bandages at the end of Day 2: 12 (from Day 1) + 50 (ordered) - 28 (used) = 34

**Day 3:**
- Bandages ordered: 2 * 50 = 100 (two bulk packs)
- Bandages used: 50 / 2 = 25 (half a pack)
- Bandages at the end of Day 3: 34 (from Day 2) + 100 (ordered) - 25 (used) = 109

However, we know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \( x \).

**Day 1:**
- Bandages at the end of Day 1: \( x + 50 - 38 = x + 12 \)

**Day 2:**
- Bandages at the end of Day 2: \( (x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34 \)

**Day 3:**
- Bandages at the end of Day 3: \( (x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109 \)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the number of bandages cannot be negative. Let's recheck the problem statement and the steps:

The correct calculation should be:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

It seems there was a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

If they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and considering the bandages used and ordered, the initial number of bandages should be:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

This indicates a mistake in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the problem constraints, the correct initial number of bandages should be:

\[ x = 78 - 109 = -31 \]

However, since the number of bandages cannot be negative, the problem might have an error in the given conditions. Assuming the problem is correctly stated, the initial number of bandages would be:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is given as $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of the haircut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together, we get:
$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:
$100."
"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April.**

Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in April.

Total hours in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours in April = 180 hours

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5.

Earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Earnings from hourly rate = $270

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10.

Total earnings = Earnings from hourly rate + Additional amount for complete attendance
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

**Final numerical answer:**
$280"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he was paid for that task, and then sum up all the amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   - $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   - $3.00 * 1 = $3.00

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he cleaned it once.
   - $1.50 * 1 = $1.50

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   - $0.75 * 2 = $1.50

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:

- $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) = $9.00

Therefore, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 20 bottles of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the remaining amount of root beer after each event.

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8."
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Now, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 22."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of Mattison's house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof.

Step 1: The height of Mattison's house is 7 times his height.
Mattison's height = 60 inches
Height of the house = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches

Step 2: The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height.
Height of the first floor = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches

Step 3: Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof.
Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, we know the total number of dogs is 4, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight of the tunas by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons thrown:
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left
   - Balloons thrown = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

Therefore, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of medicine in one dose.

1. Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
2. The amount of the second medicine is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.
3. Therefore, the total amount of medicine in one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Therefore, the total capacity of both schools combined is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = \text{Capacity of Ali's school} + \text{Capacity of John's school} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of those changes are done by Jordan's wife.
3. Subtract the number of changes done by Jordan's wife from the total to find out how many changes Jordan does.

Step 1: Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children.
\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Step 2: Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of changes done by Jordan's wife from the total to find out how many changes Jordan does.
\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]

3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]

4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
\[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years.
2. Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years.
3. Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount spent.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years
The initial cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost has increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% original + 150% increase).

\[ \text{New cost} = 2 \times (1 + 1.5) = 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \]

So, the cost of one visit after 5 years is $5.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years
Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2.

\[ \text{Total cost for the first 5 years} = 3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years
For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5.

\[ \text{Total cost for the next 3 years} = 3 \times 5 \times 3 = 45 \]

### Step 4: Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 30 + 45 = 75 \]

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To calculate how much Ali has to pay John, we need to multiply the number of each item by its respective price and then add the totals together.

For the wooden tables:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

For the roof frames:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the totals:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"To determine how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total width of the windows.
2. Multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric is needed.

First, we calculate the total width of the windows:
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- There are 5 windows.

Total width = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches.

Next, we need to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width:
- Total width = 175 inches.
- Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches.

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for a 36-minute call is \$8.00."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. 

The expected rain on Tuesday is 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's rain. 

Twice Monday's rain is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches. 

Adding 1 more inch to this gives 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

Therefore, the expected rain on Tuesday is 5 inches.

5 inches"
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The problem also states that each of the five people in the class gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Since the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies, we can write:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers (10 nails on each hand, so 20 nails in total).
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:

- The original cost of a basic manicure is $35.
- The original cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so we need to find 20% of the total cost of both services and subtract it from the total.

The total cost before discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The discount amount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art:

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails in total (10 on each hand).

The total cost for nail art is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Finally, we add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[3 \times 12 = 36\] issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[6\] issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[4 \times 6 = 24\] issues

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\] issues

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[3 + 1 + 1 = 5\]

Final numerical answer:
5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we get the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[27 + 12 = 39\]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[39 - 8 = 31\]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December is $72. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. For lessons with a veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%. 

First, let's calculate the reduced rate for veteran lessons:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

So, the reduced rate for veteran lessons is:
$80 - $20 = $60

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from the 4 standard lessons:
4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the 2 veteran lessons:
2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120

Finally, let's add the earnings from both types of lessons to get the total amount for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, let's add them up:

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, we divide the total by the number of quizzes, which is 9:

630 / 9 = 70

Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or 3/4) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

Now, let's add up all the grapes used:

- Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6
- Grapes used by her brother: 30
- Grapes used by their mother for pies: 48

Total grapes used = \(6 + 30 + 48 = 84\)

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning."

"To calculate how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down the costs and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Cost of pasta per week**: $1.00
2. **Cost of cheddar cheese per week**: $3.00
3. **Cost of gruyere cheese per week**: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, we add up the weekly costs:
- Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
- Annual cost = Total weekly cost * 52
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day
Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase.

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books. Since there are 2 middle shelves, the total capacity for the middle shelves is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

4. The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves:
   \[
   20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
   \[
   \frac{110}{55} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens would be:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ 8 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of these hats are red, so:

Red hats = 100 / 2 = 50 hats

This leaves 50 hats that are not red. Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue:

Blue hats = (3/5) * 50 = 30 hats

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total:

White hats = Total hats - Red hats - Blue hats
White hats = 100 - 50 - 30
White hats = 20

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"To find the cost per stick of jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discounted price of the bag.
2. Calculate the total cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick to cents.

Step 1: The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. So, the cost per stick in dollars is:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Step 3: To convert the cost per stick to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents per stick} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests to achieve 70% of the total questions.

1. Calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
   \[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

2. Calculate 70% of the total questions:
   \[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total to move on to the 7th grade.

3. Calculate the number of questions Audrey got correct on the first test:
   \[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

4. Determine how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers:
   \[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write this as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the information given:

1. There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights.
2. There are 8 rooms in the house, and there are 2 flashlights for each room. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
3. For the candles, half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles.
4. The total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
5. The total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

Now, we add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Total flashlights: \(4 + 16 = 20\)
- Total candles: \(16 + 20 = 36\)

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Final numerical answer:

"Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. Therefore, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

His family has five members, and if they all get the same number of chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since all sides are solved once the fifth side is done, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35\) minutes.

The Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes to solve."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones in one day.
2. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones in a 5-day work week.
3. Divide the total number of minutes in a 5-day work week by the time it takes to deal with one call.

Step 1: Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 6 hours to minutes:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 2: Now, we calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones in a 5-day work week:
\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: It takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he deals with in 1800 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the time per call:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the total drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total drying time for the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting.
- For 6 paintings, the total time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the total drying time for the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting.
- For 6 paintings, the total time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in total drying time between the new and old varnishes:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering requirements for the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total number of plants: 20
   - Plants needing half a cup: 4
   - Plants needing 1 cup: 8
   - Therefore, the number of plants needing a quarter of a cup: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water needed: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box, so we need to calculate how many boxes he needs to buy:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$7200 \]

Therefore, Derrick makes \(\$7200\) in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

To find out how many days she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

For one week:
- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total for one week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, for 5 weeks:
Total for 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade.

1. For 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 cups of fresh lemon juice (since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice).
2. For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he will need 2 cups of fresh lemon juice (since it is twice as tart, it requires twice the amount of lemon juice for the same volume of lemonade).

So, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of lemons required. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are required for 6 cups of juice:
\[ 6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 36 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for each breed and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
- 3 German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- 2 Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

Now, to find the weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 to get the number of pairs.

   - There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   - There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs, so \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   - \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs:
   - \(80 \div 2 = 40\) pairs.

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks in the tower, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

1. The tower has 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation as:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his house. Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are \(2 \times 54 = 108\) orange candies.
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\) yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

Therefore, Helen paid a total of 296 dollars for the hotel and bus travels during her trip."
"Mazie initially has 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4 in the playground. This means Dallas originally received \(21 + 4 = 25\) marbles from Mazie.

Since Mazie gave away all her marbles, the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is 52. If Dallas received 25 marbles, then Darla must have received \(52 - 25 = 27\) marbles.

Therefore, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles."

2. The cost of the child's ticket: There is 1 child, and the ticket costs $8.
   \[1 \times 8 = 8\]

3. The cost of the popcorns: They buy 2 popcorns, and each costs $3.
   \[2 \times 3 = 6\]

Now, we add the costs together to get the total amount paid:
\[24 + 8 + 6 = 38\]

Therefore, they pay a total of $38."
"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total weight is:
\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[1600 \times \frac{1}{100} = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, after a week, Dexter has 20 pounds of feed left."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children following the truck.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children doubles. Therefore, \(5 \times 2 = 10\) children are now following the truck.
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, each child is now part of a group of 3 (1 original child + 2 new children). Therefore, \(10 \times 3 = 30\) children are now following the truck.
4. **Original 5 Children Leave**: The original 5 children leave the group, so we subtract them from the total. \(30 - 5 = 25\).

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's do the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"James has 1 quarter, 2 nickels, and 7 dimes.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 2 nickels are worth 10 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 7 dimes are worth 70 cents.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.
2. All 3 sisters are 16 years old.
3. One brother is 12 years old.
4. The other brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother.

From point 4, we can determine the age of the older brother:
- The older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- The total age of the sisters: 3 sisters * 16 years each = 48 years.
- The total age of the brothers: 12 years + 24 years = 36 years.

- Total age = 48 years (sisters) + 36 years (brothers) = 84 years.

The total age of all these siblings is 84."
"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes of meditation per day. Over 4 weeks, assuming she practices every day, she would meditate for:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 840 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, she practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. Over 4 weeks, this would be:

\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Converting the yoga practice into minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on meditation and yoga:

\[ 840 \text{ minutes (meditation)} + 1200 \text{ minutes (yoga)} = 2040 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then sum these values.

1. Small t-shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet per shirt = 33 square feet
2. Medium t-shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet per shirt = 32 square feet
3. Large t-shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet per shirt = 36 square feet

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36:

\[ 36 \times 0.5 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

To find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

90"

Sarah has 27 pens."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Albert's height is given as 36 inches.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) inches.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is \(72 - 2 = 70\) inches.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before the summer, she was \(70 - 3 = 67\) inches tall.

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer."

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
   - For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Shoes:**
   - The shoes are 40% off the original price.
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16.
   - Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Jake spends is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.
   - Total cost = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan and his friends spent on ice cream. Since each ice cream cone costs $1.25 and he bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, the total cost for the ice cream is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Since each movie ticket costs $6.50, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ \frac{13}{6.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = \text{Norman High School's average enrollment} - \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost on the way, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \(x\). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \(7 - x\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29\]
\[31 - x = 29\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 31 - 29\]
\[x = 2\]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Speed is calculated as distance divided by time.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time is calculated as distance divided by speed.
   - Vanessa's time to run 4 miles is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount required:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings of Tom's restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of meals and wine per night.
2. Determine the total cost per night.
3. Calculate the total cost for the days the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost per night:
- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost of meals per night is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total cost per night is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much they make in a week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- So, the total cost for the week is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.

Since the question asks for the amount made, and the cost per night is actually an expense, the restaurant would be spending $30 a week, not making it. However, if we interpret the question as asking for the total expenditure, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine the age difference between James and his father, John:**
   - John was 32 when James was born.
   - Therefore, the age difference between John and James is \(32 - 19 = 13\) years (since John was 19 when James was born).

4. **Determine John's current age:**
   - Since the age difference between John and James is 13 years, and James is currently 18 years old, John is \(18 + 13 = 31\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is currently \(32 - 31 = 1\) year old.

6. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(1 + 3 = 4\) years old.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. **Cost of the radiator after the discount:**
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost = $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Time taken: 3 hours
   - Total labor cost = $50 * 3 = $150

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of the mechanic's labor
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To find the values of \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
- There are 7 pizzas.
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices is \(7 \times 8 = 56\).

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
- Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.
- So, we divide 56 slices by 4 people: \(56 \div 4 = 14\).

Each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
