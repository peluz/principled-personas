"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

Total bolts needed: 3"
"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The value increased by 150% of its value after the repairs were made. The repairs cost $50,000, so the new value of the house is the original purchase price plus the repairs plus the 150% increase on the total of the purchase price and repairs.

The formula to find the new value is:
\[ \text{New Value} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Repairs} + 1.5 \times (\text{Original Price} + \text{Repairs}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{New Value} = 80,000 + 50,000 + 1.5 \times (80,000 + 50,000) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = 80,000 + 50,000 + 1.5 \times 130,000 \]
\[ \text{New Value} = 80,000 + 50,000 + 195,000 \]
\[ \text{New Value} = 325,000 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price plus repairs) from the new value of the house:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New Value} - (\text{Original Price} + \text{Repairs}) \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 325,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 325,000 - 130,000 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for all the chickens is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3. Since every second glass is at the reduced price, for 16 glasses, 8 glasses will cost $5 and 8 glasses will cost $3.

Now, calculate the total cost for the glasses that cost $5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total cost for the glasses that cost $3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse based on the relationships provided.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20 sheep.

   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

**Final Answer**: 260"

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from his home.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 4 hours in total to get back home.
   - First 2 hours in standstill traffic: 0 miles.
   - Next 0.5 hours at 30 mph: Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph: Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance in standstill + Distance at 30 mph + Distance at 80 mph
   - Total distance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance traveled back
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%. So, the downloads in the third month are 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 0.70 \times 180 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: $90
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3
- Number of lemons grown per year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5

The net profit per year from selling lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

The net cost per year (including the initial planting cost and the annual maintenance cost) is:
\[ \$3 \text{ (water and feed)} \]

So, the net profit per year after the initial year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we need to determine how many years of net profit of $7.5 are required to cover $90. This can be calculated as:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. 

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time Marissa has to walk the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Determine the age difference between Raymond and his son:**
   - Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and he was born 6 years before Samantha, we need to find out how old Raymond was when Samantha was 25.
   - When Samantha was 25, Raymond was \(25 - 6 = 19\) years old.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23, which means Raymond's son was born \(23 - 19 = 4\) years after Raymond was 19.

4. **Calculate how many years ago Raymond's son was born:**
   - Since Raymond was 19 when Samantha was 25, and Raymond's son was born 4 years after Raymond was 19, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born from Samantha's current age.
   - Samantha is currently 31, and Raymond's son was born 4 years after Raymond was 19, which means Raymond's son was born when Samantha was 25.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born \(31 - 25 = 6\) years ago.

The final numerical answer is:
6 years ago."

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, let's calculate the daily care time for all the dogs:

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Final Answer:**
70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \$75.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since John initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165 on video games and had $5 left, it indicates that he did not use all the lego sets to get this amount of money. However, the question asks how many lego sets he still has, which implies he used all the lego sets he originally had.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ 0 \]

John still has 0 lego sets."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then use the formula for speed: speed = total distance / total time.

1. **Total Distance:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time:**
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, so each of those days he runs for \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours.
   - Therefore, the total time spent running is \(3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6\) hours.

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
   - Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s, then Ben’s iPhone is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone, Brandon’s iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

First, calculate the throwing distance with the gemstone:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to determine the difference between the throwing distance with the gemstone and the dragon's reach:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories each gram of the bag of chips provides. Since a 300g bag has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

The calories per gram are:
\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \text{ calories/gram} = \frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips can be eaten with the remaining 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{\frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram}} = 200 \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

First, let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. So, the number of Post-it notes left after work is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after all this, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The wire is 4 feet long, so in inches, it is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."

   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than $140.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the amounts from both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **$1596**."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information provided.

1. Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
2. To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:
   \[
   \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
   \]

3. Now, we know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:
   \[
   \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive \(\boxed{300}\) miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people.
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

\[20 + 40 = 60\]

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

\[
\text{Money from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

\[
\text{Money from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster, which is equivalent to running 90% of his original time (since 100% - 10% = 90%).

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans were used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces of sauce}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars remaining in the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we can find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away. We start with the 80 potted plants she already has and subtract the 40 potted plants she will give away:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Mary will also receive 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the remaining potted plants gives:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

**6 pages per day**"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together, we get:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[
\boxed{500}

"First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume of all 3 boxes} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and subtract the known durations.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the other days:

- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Thursday**: 1 hour and a 30-minute show.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Friday**: 2 hours.
  \[
  2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[
2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours watched on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the known hours from the total:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the hours watched on Wednesday by the duration of one episode:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then determine the average, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   - Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the total distance to the shore is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - The total distance rowed is 80 feet.
   - The total amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per teacher per day**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Whiteboard usage per lesson**: Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each of their lessons.
4. **Cleanings per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day for all teachers combined:
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Lessons per teacher per day} \]
\[ \text{Total lessons per day} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = \text{Total lessons per day} \times \text{Cleanings per lesson} \]
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

3. **Total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Selling price of 2x4x10 boards + Selling price of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total selling price = \$150 + \$120 = \$270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

1. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost
   - Profit = \$270 - \$180 = \$90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by \(7x\):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."

"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of an orange**: An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

1. **Cost of 4 watermelons**: 
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Cost of 20 peppers**: 
   \[
   20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of 10 oranges**: 
   \[
   10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we sum up the total cost:
\[
180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time spent = \( 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \( \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Calculate the revenue from doctors' charges:**
   - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Revenue from doctors = \( 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the revenue from patients' charges:**
   - Patients are charged $200 per hour.
   - Revenue from patients = \( 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from doctors + Revenue from patients = \( 30000 \text{ dollars} + 40000 \text{ dollars} = 70000 \text{ dollars} \).

6. **Calculate the total cost (which is the revenue from doctors' charges):**
   - Total cost = \( 30000 \text{ dollars} \).

7. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \( 70000 \text{ dollars} - 30000 \text{ dollars} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \).

**Final Answer:**
The hospital makes a profit of $40,000 from these visits."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them.
2. Subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number to find the remaining number of elves.
3. Subtract the 10 elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining number.

Let's start with the first step:

1. A third of the 60 elves quit:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.

2. Subtract the 20 elves who quit from the initial 60 elves:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 elves remain.

3. Subtract the 10 elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining 40 elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the final number of elves left is:

\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took and then the total number of tickets used.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ rides} \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ rides} \]

Together, Pam and Fred took:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ rides} \]

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:
\[ 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- Cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each: \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
- Cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)
- Cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee on the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed in each test based on his rate of 5 questions per hour.

For the first test:
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would complete \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[75 - 40 = 35\]

For the second test:
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would complete \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[100 - 30 = 70\]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[35 + 70 = 105\]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]
\[ B = 2Q \]

Now substitute these into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items and will not be taxed.

The cost of the non-food items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 (original cost) + $1 (tax) = $11

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for supplies per client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:**
   - John has 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - He can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (since 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

   Therefore, the number of pineapples per hectare per year is:
   \[
   100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pineapples for the entire field:**
   - John has 10 hectares of the field.

   Therefore, the total number of pineapples for the entire field per year is:
   \[
   400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 60 bees have now returned.

To find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we need to account for the bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours.

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30 bees
- Bees that returned in the next 6 hours: 15 bees
- Bees that left in the following 6 hours: 60 bees

The total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees} \]

Out of these 90 bees, 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that did not return in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees} \]

These 75 bees are the ones that returned in the last 6 hours.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:

"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each bike has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to find \( x \).

After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.

Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y \). So, \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \), which means \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.

Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.

Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours for each day of the week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days with three 1-hour classes:
- Each day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
\[3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days with two 2-hour classes:
- Each day (Tuesday, Thursday) has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
\[4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, we add the hours from both types of days to get the total hours per week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[272\]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Next, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we divide the total length in inches by 12:
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be \(\boxed{280}\) feet long."

400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[
200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:
\[
3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and the rim of bond paper.

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Rim of Bond Paper:**
   - The rim of bond paper costs $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of rim of bond paper
- Total cost = \( 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \) dollars.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, reducing the number of tadpoles he can see by 2.

So, the calculation is as follows:

1. Initial number of tadpoles seen: 11
2. Tadpoles seen after 6 more come out: \(11 + 6 = 17\)
3. Tadpoles seen after 2 hide under a rock: \(17 - 2 = 15\)

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is 15."
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday would be:

\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

**Anakin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price = $20
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase every two months:**
   - Increase every two months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months = 36 / 2 = 18

4. **Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months:**
   - Total increase = Increase every two months * Number of two-month periods
   - Total increase = $4 * 18 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months:**
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

We know:
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- An action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
Since each red car costs $4 and there are 5 red cars, the total cost for the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the action figures:
Since each action figure costs $5 and there are 3 action figures, the total cost for the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's add up the costs of all the toys:
\[ 20 \text{ (red cars)} + 15 \text{ (action figures)} + 15 \text{ (doll)} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will lose 3 hours of work.
   - Therefore, the total lost income is \( 35 \times 3 = 105 \) dollars.

2. **Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will spend $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she will lose $105 in potential income.
   - The difference in money is \( 105 - 90 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into this equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

1. Twice the money Ethel has: \(2 \times 8 = 16\)
2. Add $2 to that amount: \(16 + 2 = 18\)

So, Jimmy has $18. 

Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item in the uniform:

1. **Hat cost**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Jacket cost**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. **Pants cost**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Hat cost} + \text{Jacket cost}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Hat cost} + \text{Jacket cost} + \text{Pants cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum up the total legs from all the creatures:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of each bird and then sum these ages.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Since Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two's age is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:
\[ 8 \text{ (Sally Thirtytwo)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} = 41 \]

The total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{41}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, and he has 60 potatoes, the total time for peeling is:

\[ 1.5 \, \text{minutes/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 90 \, \text{minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato, and he has 60 potatoes, the total time for cutting is:

\[ 5 \, \text{seconds/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 300 \, \text{seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ 300 \, \text{seconds} \div 60 = 5 \, \text{minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together to find the total time:

\[ 90 \, \text{minutes} + 5 \, \text{minutes} = 95 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

\[ \boxed{95 \, \text{minutes}} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of lemons and sugar based on the profit they made.

First, let's establish the relationship between the cost, revenue, and profit.

1. **Cost per gallon:**
   - Lemons: $3
   - Sugar: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon for $0.50 each.
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Profit per gallon:**
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Total profit:**
   - They made a total profit of $25.

5. **Number of gallons sold:**
   - Since the profit per gallon is $5, the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit is:
   - Number of gallons = Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

6. **Total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, the total amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, we need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know the total number of Asians is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
\[
\text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
\[
\text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife.
\[
\text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. **Bo's crabs**: Given as 40.
2. **Monic's crabs**: Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. **Rani's crabs**: Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total:

\[
40 \text{ (Bo's crabs)} + 36 \text{ (Monic's crabs)} + 46 \text{ (Rani's crabs)} = 122
\]

**Total number of crabs**: 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 per hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks together:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \( 20 \)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and that this number is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14
\]
Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:
\[
14 + 5 = 19
\]
This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is:
\[
19 + 2 = 21
\]
Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:
\[
21 + 2 = 23
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the slower team is:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 212 \text{ seconds} = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed and the given conditions.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of rats is unknown, but we can denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of hamsters is unknown, but we can denote the number of hamsters in each cage as \( h \).

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits.
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total amount of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces.

We can set up the equation for the straw distributed to the rats and hamsters:

\[
3r \times 6 + 10h \times 5 = 160
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
18r + 50h = 160
\]

We need to find the values of \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. Since \( r \) and \( h \) must be whole numbers, we can test possible values for \( r \) and solve for \( h \).

Let's start by testing small values for \( r \):

1. If \( r = 1 \):

\[
18(1) + 50h = 160 \implies 18 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 142 \implies h = 2.84 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

2. If \( r = 2 \):

\[
18(2) + 50h = 160 \implies 36 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 124 \implies h = 2.48 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

3. If \( r = 3 \):

\[
18(3) + 50h = 160 \implies 54 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 106 \implies h = 2.12 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

4. If \( r = 4 \):

\[
18(4) + 50h = 160 \implies 72 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 88 \implies h = 1.76 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

5. If \( r = 5 \):

\[
18(5) + 50h = 160 \implies 90 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 70 \implies h = 1.4 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

6. If \( r = 6 \):

\[
18(6) + 50h = 160 \implies 108 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 52 \implies h = 1.04 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

7. If \( r = 7 \):

\[
18(7) + 50h = 160 \implies 126 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 34 \implies h = 0.68 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

8. If \( r = 8 \):

\[
18(8) + 50h = 160 \implies 144 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = 16 \implies h = 0.32 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

9. If \( r = 9 \):

\[
18(9) + 50h = 160 \implies 162 + 50h = 160 \implies 50h = -2 \quad (\text{not possible})
\]

Since none of the values for \( r \) from 1 to 9 result in an integer value for \( h \), we need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the constraints, the only feasible solution is:

\[
r = 4, h = 2
\]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with monthly compounding interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Plugging in the values:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.02 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 \approx 1.061208 \]

So,
\[ A \approx 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying and the transportation cost.
   - Total cost = \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue for \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend paid:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. First, convert the hours into minutes:

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

First, calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

At noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each of the 40 restaurants is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

So, Baldur gets \(\boxed{55}\) liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we apply the 5% raise to his annual salary. A 5% raise on $104000 is calculated as:

\[ 104000 \times 0.05 = 5200 \]

So, his new annual salary after the raise is:

\[ 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his new annual salary:

\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year:**
   - Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
   - Josie has 10 acres.
   - Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:
     \[
     10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total barrels of wine produced per year:**

   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:

"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g}
\]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g}
\]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn. Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her earnings from mowing the lawn are:
\[ 4x \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, her total earnings from both babysitting and mowing the lawn, plus her savings, are:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \text{ dollars} \]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge.

The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:
\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her hourly wage is $8.00. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months.

The total payment over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total payment from the total amount to be returned.

The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are \(4 + 7 = 11\) dahlias.

**Total number of flowers in the vase: 15.**"
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, Brianna's points are:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]

3. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:

"To find out how much time Carmen spent on crossword and sudoku puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.

Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants \(90 - 40 = 50\) petunias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:
\[90 + 50 = 140\]

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. A third of $15000 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost for Carlos and Benji's rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \(\boxed{180}\)."

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- After losing 8 water type cards, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards.
- After buying 14 grass type cards, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type card. The probability is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \]

Convert the decimal to a percentage and round to the nearest integer:
\[ 0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final answer is:

"To find out how much Chad still owes, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base burrito**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the additional costs:
\[ 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 7.50 \]

Now, we add the base burrito cost to the total of the additional costs:
\[ 6.50 + 7.50 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the subtotal.

\[ \text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the subtotal to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Initially, there are 36 penguins sunbathing.

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[

\]

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that have left from the initial number:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
12

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has enough empty pens.

Let's calculate the total number of pens step by step:

- **First Cycle**: 
  - He uses 25 pens, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens from these 25 empty pens.
  - Now, he has 5 new pens and 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens from the new pens.
  - Total pens now: 5 (new) + 20 (remaining from the first 25) = 25 pens.

- **Second Cycle**:
  - He uses 25 pens again, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens from these 25 empty pens.
  - Now, he has 5 new pens and 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens from the new pens.
  - Total pens now: 5 (new) + 20 (remaining from the second 25) = 25 pens.

- **Third Cycle**:
  - He uses 25 pens again, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens from these 25 empty pens.
  - Now, he has 5 new pens and 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens from the new pens.
  - Total pens now: 5 (new) + 20 (remaining from the third 25) = 25 pens.

- **Fourth Cycle**:
  - He uses 25 pens again, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens from these 25 empty pens.
  - Now, he has 5 new pens and 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens from the new pens.
  - Total pens now: 5 (new) + 20 (remaining from the fourth 25) = 25 pens.

- **Fifth Cycle**:
  - He uses 25 pens again, which leaves him with 25 empty pens.
  - He can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens from these 25 empty pens.
  - Now, he has 5 new pens and 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens from the new pens.
  - Total pens now: 5 (new) + 20 (remaining from the fifth 25) = 25 pens.

After each cycle, the total number of pens remains 25 because the process of using 25 pens and refilling with 5 new pens from the empty ones results in the same total count.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram can have is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Johnny initially took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount of money he had was:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[ R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both, without double-counting any book.

- Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, totaling 3 books.
- Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, totaling 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, and each book is read by at least one person, we simply add the number of books each has:

2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

So, collectively, they will read 3 books by the end.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from his pen pals each week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in response. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes each week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages (responses)} + 30 \text{ pages (replies)} = 60 \text{ pages} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing each week is:

\[ 60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes included in the plan:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Jason has \(\boxed{250}\) minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24 fries.
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after receiving from Ginger: \(9 + x\) fries.
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:** 
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\).

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 27

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies eaten by Sue:**
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

**Total cookies eaten by her sister:**
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed by Sue:**
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

**Calories consumed by her sister:**
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed \(\boxed{5600}\) more calories than her sister."

"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Adding these new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, the total number of cows in each stall becomes:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:
\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"First, calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, determine the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, calculate the weight lost due to the termites, which ate 30% of the redwood:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Subtract the weight lost from the original weight to find the remaining weight of the redwood:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. First, we sum up the fruits for each person:

- Andrea's total fruits: \( 52 \text{ apples} + 24 \text{ bananas} = 76 \)
- Jamal's total fruits: \( 44 \text{ apples} + 48 \text{ bananas} = 92 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of fruits:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging both small and large holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- Therefore, the total time for small holes is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- Therefore, the total time for large holes is \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, we add the time for both small and large holes:
- Total time in minutes = \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, \(240\) minutes is \(\frac{240}{60} = 4\) hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Sam is 6 years old.**"
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

The total number of spots on all the cobras is:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots on all the mambas is:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- Including the 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

\[
\frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
     \[
     8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length:
     \[
     25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - To find the number of beads, divide the remaining length by the length of one bead:
     \[
     \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
     \]

Thus, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these totals together:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the first five rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the first five rows from the total number of stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars make up these 40 stars. We do this by dividing 40 by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine how many trucks are needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get:

\[ 2 \text{ chocolate bars} \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not more than 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum the points of all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike's total points: 22
- Jim's total points: 18
- Tony's total points: 43

Adding these together, we get:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

Therefore, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day:

- **Pushups**: On the first day, he does 100 pushups. On the second day, he does 20 more than on the first day, so:
  \[
  100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pushups}
  \]

- **Squats**: On the first day, he does 50 squats. On the second day, he does 10 fewer squats, so:
  \[
  50 - 10 = 40 \text{ squats}
  \]

- **Dumbbell presses**: On the first day, he does 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he doubles the number, so:
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dumbbell presses}
  \]

Next, we sum up the activities for each day:

- **First day**:
  \[
  100 \text{ pushups} + 50 \text{ squats} + 20 \text{ dumbbell presses} = 170 \text{ activities}
  \]

- **Second day**:
  \[
  120 \text{ pushups} + 40 \text{ squats} + 40 \text{ dumbbell presses} = 200 \text{ activities}

"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of books sold in the first year
Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since she sold 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of books sold in the second year
We know the total number of books in the collection is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

The number of books sold in the second year can be calculated by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[ 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year
Each book sells for $20, so the total earnings from the books sold in the second year are:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 50 \, \text{hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made:

\[ \$3200 \]

in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning.

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can use the following calculation:

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs consumed daily by the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, in a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

**Final Answer:**

"Given that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can determine Jane's age as follows:

\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:

\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Then, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments from the total number of people invited:
\[
24 - 8 - 2 = 14
\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Adding the 20 marbles Solomon bought and the 8 marbles his father gave him, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of girls**: Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of nongendered children**: The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total number of children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
6. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of \(25 + 15 = 40\) people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. Therefore, the number of people who left is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]
This means that \(40 - 10 = 30\) people remained at the party.

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \(W\). The total number of people who stayed is the sum of the men and women who stayed:
\[
22 + W = 30
\]
Solving for \(W\):
\[
W = 30 - 22 = 8
\]
Thus, the number of women who are left at the party is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Given that the number of loose pencils is 2, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are in three boxes, we can determine the number of pencils per box:

\[ \text{Number of pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, let's consider the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, assuming each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes required is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.

2. **Effect on Coffee Strength from Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters weaker.

3. **Effect from Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   - Total weakening = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people trade and leave with 7 new records.

First, we calculate the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for each new record, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be found by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15 per hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share after the first year is:

New price per share = $8 * (1 + 50%) = $8 * 1.50 = $12

The value of all shares after the first year is:

Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share after the second year is:

New price per share = $12 * (1 - 25%) = $12 * 0.75 = $9

The value of all shares after the second year is:

Final value of shares = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in the three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).
2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]
3. The total number of animals is 60, so:
   \[
   H + C = 60
   \]
4. Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the equation \( H + C = 60 \):
   \[
   2C + C = 60
   \]
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   \[
   C = 20
   \]
5. Now, we can find the number of chickens:
   \[
   H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

6. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = (20 \times 4) + (40 \times 2) = 80 + 80 = 160

\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Adding this to his current daily distance:
\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, Tyson would run 6000 meters each day if he followed his coach's advice.

Next, we need to determine the total distance Tyson would cover in June if he trained for the entire month. June typically has 30 days.

To find the total distance for the month:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[
180000 \text{ meters}

"To find the total number of legs from the tables, we can break the problem into two parts: calculating the legs from the 4-legged tables and the 3-legged tables, and then summing these amounts.

1. **Calculate the legs from the 4-legged tables:**
   - There are 40 tables with 4 legs each.
   - Total legs from 4-legged tables = \( 40 \times 4 = 160 \).

2. **Calculate the legs from the 3-legged tables:**
   - There are 50 tables with 3 legs each.
   - Total legs from 3-legged tables = \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \).

3. **Sum the legs from both types of tables:**
   - Total legs = \( 160 + 150 = 310 \).

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is \( 310 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats \(\boxed{9}\) cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

\[ \text{Cost per shirt} = \$30 \]
\[ \text{Number of shirts} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 30 \times 2 = \$60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = 40\% \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = \$24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Davos paid:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = 60 - 24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid \(\$36\) for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the increase in daily revenue:

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of the second tree.
2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Step 1: The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Since the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Step 2: The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Let \( C \) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half of his change is also $2.
   - Therefore, \( C = 2 + 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10.
   - He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Thus, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

   - Total cost for picture frames = \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of etching the picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds an additional 20% to the cost.
   - Additional cost per frame = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total additional cost for etching = \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Additional cost for etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = \( 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1208 \) dollars.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is \(\boxed{1208}\)."

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Saturday = \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday before returns = \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.
   - Six pairs were returned because they didn't fit.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday after returns = \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

4. **Total number of pairs sold:**
   - Total pairs sold = Pairs sold on Friday + Pairs sold on Saturday + Pairs sold on Sunday after returns.
   - Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \(\boxed{50}\)."

Next, calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each will produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each will produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk produced by both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman initially made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, the number of rolls remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Each of the remaining rolls was broken into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces fed to the chickens is:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is:
\[ 48 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

pupils who do not like blue. Out of these remaining 20 pupils, one-fourth likes green. Therefore, the number of pupils who like green is:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14 apples. Adding the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday, we get:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks (since 1 pair = 2 socks), and also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she washed is:
\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies, so the total number of cookies Rachel had before her brother ate some is:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Her brother then ate 44 cookies, so the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

The interest on the principal amount of $3,650 for five months is:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = \frac{3650}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

The distance Cho hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

The distance Chloe hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance hiked by Cho} - \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups. The time taken to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the total hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 6 erasers.
2. Calculate the cost of 8 pencils.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

Step 1: The cost of one eraser is $2. Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Step 2: The cost of one pencil is $3. Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Step 3: Add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost: $30 (for the bracelet).
- Dasha's cost: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's determine the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discounted cost. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original cost:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of his old cable subscription, which was $60 per month. The savings from cancelling the cable subscription and switching to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. **Writing a song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up the time spent on each activity:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards Erica gave away is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards} \]

The total number of cards she received is:
\[ 17 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we calculate the net change in the number of cards Erica has:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the daily energy consumption if the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours):
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed by Walking to and from School**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.
   \[
   \text{Steps to and from school} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Additional Steps**: He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Steps Left After Jogging**: After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.
   \[
   \text{Steps taken before jogging} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During Jogging**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had already taken from the total steps taken before jogging.
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Therefore, Elliott took \(\boxed{2000}\) steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby will be \(\boxed{40}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May and June} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June} = 24000 + 18000 = 42000
   \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each priced at $0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it is worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we find the total cost of the fireworks before the discount by adding the cost of the first pack, the second pack, and the finale firework:

\[ 400 + 800 + 150 = 1350 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1350:

\[ 0.20 \times 1350 = 270 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Tim spent:

\[ 1350 - 270 = 1080 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1080} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

**Final Answer:**
5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us the percentage of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, which is 5%.

Given that Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, we can infer that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. This is because 100% - 99% = 1%.

Now, we need to find out how many of the candles that are more dangerous (5% of the total) also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are more dangerous, and we assume that the defect that makes them smell like wet dog is only present in the more dangerous candles, we can calculate the number of candles that are both more dangerous and have the defect as follows:

1. Calculate the number of more dangerous candles:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

2. Since all of these 2500 more dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and we assume none of these explode (as no additional information is given about the explosion rate of these specific candles), the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

The discount amount per blouse is calculated as:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact number is not specified yet.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer:**
350"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is \(\frac{1}{4}\) the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. 

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Stanley's comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb.

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 20 cats that were carried away from the initial 50 cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\$284

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the sale price, so \( J = 22 + 6 = 28 \).

The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since both the original prices are the same ($28), the difference is:
\[ J - T = 28 - 28 = 0 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost the same as the tattered jeans, and the answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. We know that each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian builds attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders. Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. The total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she built is \(3 \times 30 = 90\). The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(90 + 60 = 150\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests were prepared to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.

2. **Additional Guests:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than the initial 36 guests.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the initial 18 guests who wanted two each.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who had their first hotdog) each wanted one hotdog.

3. **Hotdogs Needed:**
   - The 22 additional guests each wanted one hotdog, so they needed 22 more hotdogs.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs, but 18 of these were for the first hotdog of the 18 guests who wanted two each.
   - Therefore, the caterer had \( 36 - 18 = 18 \) hotdogs left for the first hotdog of the 22 additional guests.
   - Since 22 additional guests each wanted one hotdog and the caterer only had 18 hotdogs left, 4 additional guests did not get a second hotdog.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 4 \).

"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total number of letters:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:

"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the remaining amount as follows:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{servings} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts his journey.

Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes (her travel time) plus 9 minutes (the time before Wayne arrives) earlier than Wayne. This gives us:

\[ 16 + 9 = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Process**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Therefore, over 3 hours, the temperature increase is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.
   - The temperature after baking is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

3. **Cooling Process**:
   - Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes.
   - The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.
   - In 30 minutes, the cooling effect is \(30 / 10 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.
   - The temperature after opening the window is \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees.

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:
\[75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
\[\frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael will have after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, the number of trays she can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

So, Rozanne can put out \(\boxed{2}\) trays."

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's break down the costs and savings step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket and Popcorn with Soda:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket and Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket and popcorn and soda minus the cost of the super ticket and popcorn with soda equals $2.
   - Mathematically, this is: \((15 + P) - 21 = 2\)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   15 + P - 21 = 2
   \]
   \[
   P - 6 = 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 8
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 65 \times 170
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
65 \times 170 = 65 \times (100 + 70) = (65 \times 100) + (65 \times 70) = 6500 + 4550 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the distance for the first part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Calculate the distance for the second part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first part + Distance of second part = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time of first part + Time of second part = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, she has:
- \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires left
- \(0 + 2 = 2\) rubies

The value of the 5 sapphires she has left is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies she has is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the value of the remaining sapphires and rubies gives:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \text{ fairies} \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \text{ fairies} \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Find the percentage of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Find the percentage of puppies with spots.**

The percentage of puppies with spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds

2. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds

3. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds

4. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- After Monday: 200 + 10 = 210
- After Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240
- After Friday: 240 + 60 = 300
- After Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake \(\boxed{4}\) pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The problem states that the piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2, so three times the price of the pen is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Since the piece of paper costs $1 less than this amount, the cost of the piece of paper is:

\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper:

\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the amount of change Theo received, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

The number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet since the shark's length is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \( 80 \)."
"To break in the new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week to achieve this goal in three weeks.

First, calculate the total number of days he will walk:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend \(\boxed{20}\) minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we divide the total amount spent by the price per book:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$300}{\$15 \text{ per book}} = 20 \text{ books} \]

Sarah gave an equal number of these books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{20 \text{ books}}{4 \text{ kids}} = 5 \text{ books per child} \]

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts) is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
   - Total employees = \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups.
   - Total tour guides = \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
   - Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides
   - Total people = \(600 + 21 = 621\).

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, we calculate how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay needed to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and then subtract this from their goal.

1. Calculate the total amount earned by Keegan and Tashay by 3 pm:
   \[
   \text{Total earned} = \text{Keegan's earnings} + \text{Tashay's earnings} = 83 + 91 = 174
   \]

2. Subtract the total amount earned from their goal to find out how much more they need to earn:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Total earned} = 200 - 174 = 26
   \]

Therefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. According to the problem, the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so the cost of the family-size pizza is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) dollars.
3. Adding the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza together, we get \(8 + 24 = 32\) dollars.

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts.

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost \(2 \times 4.00 = 8.00\) dollars.

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale. This means that for every pack Heather buys, she gets another one free. Since she is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 packs in total but only pay for 1 pack.

- The cost for 2 packs with the ""buy one get one free"" sale is \(4.00\) dollars (for 2 packs).

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the discounted price.

- The cost after the coupon is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Heather is buying 2 packs, which contain 8 razors (since each pack contains 4 razors).

- The cost per razor is \(\frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor}\).

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert 0.25 dollars to cents.

- \(0.25 \text{ dollars} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, who is 60"" tall. This cheerleader will be at the top of the human pyramid.

The human pyramid structure is as follows:
- Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders
- Second layer: 3 cheerleaders
- Third layer: 2 cheerleaders
- Top layer: 1 cheerleader (the shortest one, 60"" tall)

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. We can assume the other cheerleaders are 64"" tall for the bottom and middle layers of the pyramid.

Now, let's calculate the total height of the human pyramid:
- Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders): \(4 \times 64"" = 256""\)
- Second layer (3 cheerleaders): \(3 \times 64"" = 192""\)
- Third layer (2 cheerleaders): \(2 \times 64"" = 128""\)
- Top layer (1 cheerleader): \(60""\)

Adding these together gives the total height of the pyramid in inches:
\[256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""\]

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636"" \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 \).

\[
6 \times 14 = 84
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 \).

\[
2 \times 14 = 28
\]

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
\[
84 + 28 = 112
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{112}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( n \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \(L = D + 7\)
2. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)
3. \(L + D + B = 43\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the second equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the third equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[\boxed{16}\]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."

"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the weekly cost without the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, let's determine the number of cows in the zoo. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's determine the number of sheep on the farm. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo gives:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given about Rose's purchases. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of onions Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
\[ 12 = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
\[ 4 = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
To find the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought to find the total number of items she purchased:
\[ \text{Total number of items Sophia bought} = \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} + \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July up to July 19th: 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Gerald has left is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"

Next, calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Water per kilometer} = 2 \, \text{km} \times 60 \, \text{ml/km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink \(\boxed{120}\) milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

After buying clothes, the remaining amount of money is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

After buying CDs, the remaining amount of money is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"First, we determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. The amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each individual:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Next, we sum the rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh} + 2 \text{ kWh} = 14 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

The rate of one person painting a house is therefore \( \frac{1}{10} \) of a house per day.

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of a house per day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then the number of chairs she has is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[
\text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount without headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]"
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers get on the bus.

After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off. So, \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) passengers get on the bus.

After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

**Final Answer:**
66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of one monitor. Let the cost of one monitor be \( M \). Then the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):

\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):

\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

"To find Anne's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Alyana's age.
2. Use Alyana's age to find Anne's age.

First, we know Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we calculate Alyana's age as follows:
\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we calculate Anne's age as follows:
\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \, \text{mm} - 5 \, \text{mm} = 45 \, \text{mm}

4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \, \text{mm} = 62 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm} = 188 \, \text{mm}
\]

The total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks.

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma has made 54 vlogs so far. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"First, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount.

Total amount = $50 + $10 = $60

Since the check is to be split evenly and you are paying the additional 20% tip, you will pay half of the total amount.

Amount you pay = $60 / 2 = $30

So, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left. Therefore, the amount he had after tripling is:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[
\boxed{39}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   \[
   \text{Total savings in the first half} = 15x
   \]

5. **Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half:**
   \[
   \text{Amount saved each day in the second half} = 2x
   \]

6. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   \[
   \text{Total savings in the second half} = 15 \times 2x = 30x
   \]

7. **Set up the equation for the total savings for the month:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

8. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

10. **Determine the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half:**
    \[
    2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
    \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

- The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.

\[ \text{Jairus's total earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.

\[ \text{Jenny's total earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Jairus's total earnings} - \text{Jenny's total earnings} = 16 - 10 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles per day.

If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is:

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

"To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

Thus, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add that to his final weight.

1. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.
2. Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.
3. His final weight is 70 pounds.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
- Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
- Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
- Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00
\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 \times 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 \times 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is \(\boxed{450}\)."

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a hot day.

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. 

On a cold day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a hot day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is \(\boxed{180}\) pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time of Movement**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of the Sun**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Movement} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees}

- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The total amount spent from Sunday to Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
\]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[
70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars left}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The total amount he can spend on plastic action figures is $40. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\text{Total action figures} = 6 + 20 = 26
\]

\[
\boxed{26}

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00.
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is $37.00."

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

If Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when she sets it to 450. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) such that the oven will read 520 degrees but is actually 4% too hot. This means:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 × 60 minutes = 120 minutes
   - So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Now, let's perform the addition in the numerator:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. Therefore, his spending on Wednesday is:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   Adding up his spending over the three days, we get:
   \[
   8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Money Left:**
   Subtracting his total spending from his original amount of $100, we get:
   \[
   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Howard has left is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, he earned \(4 \times 7.50 = 30\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
- Over two hours, he earned \(2 \times 6.00 = 12\) dollars.

Finally, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per tire per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per tire per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine how many years it takes for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - The tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, each pump gives:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings, so the cost per washing is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since each pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per pump in cents is:
     \[
     12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

1. **Discount on the shirt:**
   - Original price of the shirt: $25
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \)

2. **Discount on the shorts:**
   - Original price of the shorts: $35
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \)

3. **Total cost after discounts:**
   - Total cost: \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \)

4. **Money left after the purchase:**
   - Joe's initial amount: $50
   - Total cost after discounts: $42.00
   - Money left: \( 50 - 42 = 8.00 \)

**Final answer:**
Joe will have $8.00 left after the purchase."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 29100 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 95060 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{\$} - 29100 \, \text{\$} = 65960 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Initial Funding and Duration:**
   - John gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.

2. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining \(50 - 5 = 45\) months, the funding per month increases by 50% each month.

3. **Calculate the Funding for Each Month:**
   - The funding for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The funding for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - This pattern continues, with each month's funding being 1.5 times the previous month's funding.

4. **Sum the Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The funding for the remaining 45 months forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).
   - The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by \(S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\).

   Here, \(n = 45\), \(a = 150,000\), and \(r = 1.5\).

   \[
   S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1}
   \]

   \[
   S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5}
   \]

   \[
   S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1)
   \]

5. **Calculate \(1.5^{45}\):**
   - Using a calculator, \(1.5^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467\).

6. **Sum the Series:**
   \[
   S_{45} = 300,000 (1,162,261.467 - 1)
   \]

   \[
   S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,162,260.467
   \]

   \[
   S_{45} \approx 348,678,140.1
   \]

7. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 45 months.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 348,678,140.1
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} \approx 348,778,140.1
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately \(\boxed{348,778,140.1}\)."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of meat Prince will have to sell from the bull. The bull weighs 750 kg.

Next, we calculate how much meat Prince sells in one day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the entire 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount of meat he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

After the administrators have taken their seats, the number of remaining seats is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking. Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ times}
   \]

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking. Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ times}
   \]

3. Adding the remaining play times of both DVDs gives:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509 \text{ times}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert Ashley's speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed in the first three days and the last four days gives the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam needs to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

4 years"
"First, let's calculate the total cost to the company for the cars James sold. Since the company paid 30% of the $25,000 price for each car, the cost per car to the company is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

James sold 10 cars, so the total cost to the company for these cars is:

\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Each car was sold for $25,000, and he sold 10 cars, so the total revenue is:

\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost to the company:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. Therefore, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, the amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, the price of a silver jewel is:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by summing their individual prices:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:
   \[

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:**
   - Distance to be covered: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

**Final answer:**
5 hours"
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's determine the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes, so the cost per class is:

\[
\frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can miss some classes without his parents deciding not to sign him up again. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class in this scenario is:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10, and remember to reverse the inequality sign:

\[
4 \geq x
\]

So, \( x \leq 4 \). This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers daily} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ \text{Jewel's weekly production} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ customers} \]
\[ \text{Julie's weekly production} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \text{ customers} \]

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:

\[ 350 + 700 = 1050 \text{ customers} \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:

\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \(\frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30\) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \(\frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10\) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, the cost for 5 apples is \(5 \times 1.30 = 6.50\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, the cost for 5 oranges is \(5 \times 1.10 = 5.50\) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \(6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00\) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month were:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental:**
   - The hanger rental costs $5,000 per month.

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\) dollars per month.

Next, we calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental} + \text{Fuel Cost} = 5,000 + 10,000 = 15,000 \text{ dollars} \]

   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80\) minutes = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can write the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
2S + G - S - G = 15
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \)."

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.

1. **Cost of 2 bags of chips**: \(2 \text{ bags} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bag} = \$4.00\)
2. **Cost of the bucket of fried chicken**: \$8.00
3. **Cost of the bottle of soda**: \$1.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda:
\[
\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."

\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add these 5 minutes to the initial 48 minutes:

\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted:

\[ \boxed{53} \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of employees who are in management. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. We know that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. So, we calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of employees who oversee the company} = 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first calculate the amount of each ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

1. **Flour:**
   - For one muffin: 5 tablespoons
   - For 16 muffins: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) tablespoons

2. **Sugar:**

Next, we add these two amounts to find the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the change Adam got is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so that accounts for 8 good days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days are added here.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days are added here.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This adds 2 more good days (since the first and third days were good).

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
- Good days from the first 8 days: 8
- Good days from the next 3 days: 2

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

So, the total number of good days in the month is 10. 

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. Therefore, the bamboo needs to grow:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

**12 days**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so there are \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so there are \(24 - 3 = 21\) dogs.
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 12 toys.
   - After the second purchase, he had enough for 24 dogs.
   - Since 3 dogs left, he no longer needs the toys for those 3 dogs, but he already had enough for them.

So, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he bought:
\[ 4 \text{ (initial toys)} + 8 \text{ (first purchase)} + 12 \text{ (second purchase)} = 24 \]

**Final Answer:**
24"
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Therefore, Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is:

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240."

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect \(\boxed{36}\) more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for the two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's determine how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, we can calculate how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Including Jack, the total number of people is 9. Since Jack is also an adult, his weight is also 80 kg. Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults gives:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we add these amounts together:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow the entire lawn when he uses both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Time to mow the entire lawn: 1 hour = 60 minutes.
   - Rate of mowing in turtle mode: \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Time to mow the entire lawn: 40 minutes.
   - Rate of mowing in rabbit mode: \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode.

3. **Time to mow half the lawn in turtle mode:**
   - Half the lawn: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}\).
   - Time: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Time to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode:**
   - Half the lawn: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}\).
   - Time: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time.

5. **Total time to mow the entire lawn:**
   - Time in turtle mode: 30 minutes.
   - Time in rabbit mode: 20 minutes.
   - Total time: \(30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, they have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost of apples is $4 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the total cost for apples is \(1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4\).

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost of bananas is $2 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4\).

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost of oranges is $3 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of the individuals are 44, so we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are the same age, we have \( T_1 = T_2 \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know from the first equation that \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \). Substituting \( T_1 \) in the combined age equation, we get:
\[ 2(P_1 + 7) + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_1 + 14 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]

Since the triplets are the same age, let's denote the age of each triplet as \( P \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 3P + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]
\[ 3P + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 5P = 30 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( P = 6 \) back into the equation \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \):
\[ T_1 = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T_1 = 13 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this to minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the lollipops and the candies together, we get the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong and Neil over these 120 months.

For Rong:
\[ \text{Total savings for Rong} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

For Neil:
\[ \text{Total savings for Neil} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Adding the total savings of Rong and Neil together gives us the final answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1.0\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = 5.0\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6.0\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. Given that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer**: The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

Thus, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 800 \, \text{pounds} = 4,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 4,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8,800 pounds from 11,600 pounds:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} - 8,800 \, \text{pounds} = 2,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."

"First, we determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, we multiply this speed by the time (40 seconds) to find the distance.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"First, let's determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used for industrial purposes by the city. The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Next, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water that is used for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is used for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage used for non-industrial purposes is:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

\[ \boxed{8\%} \]"

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends) who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"

\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Initial number - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = 3000 - 2000 = 1000

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.

Adding these together, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[
\frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, and we need exactly 3 sleeves, we will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's sum up the weights:

- Math books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 math books)
- Science books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 science books)
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

Adding these together:

\[4 \text{ (math)} + 4 \text{ (science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}

"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine the number of books Steven has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven:
\[ 2S = 20 \]
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is:

"First, we determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[
0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

This means there are 16 girls in each class. To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[
40 - 16 = 24
\]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

3. **Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them, so she has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left.
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

4. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons: 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to small buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons = \(27 + 60 + 60 = 147\) small buttons.

5. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons: 27 large buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons: 60 large buttons.
   - Total large buttons = \(27 + 60 = 87\) large buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**
   - We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

2. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Since there are 18 Pomeranians, and they represent two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18
     \]
   - Solving for the total number of puppies:
     \[
     \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
     \]

Therefore, Jana has \(\boxed{27}\) puppies."
"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it:

\[
\text{Amount given by Ava} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the amount Jayden originally had to the amount given by Ava:

\[
\text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \( \frac{1000}{7} \) cases of shingles, which is approximately 142.86 cases. However, since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we will use the exact fraction:

The third house will need \(\boxed{\frac{1000}{7}}\) cases of shingles."

"First, we need to determine how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of pears and bananas together:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits in total."

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of books Ahmed read} = \frac{\text{Number of books Ezra read}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra has read in total after deciding to read 150 more books. Initially, Ezra read 300 books and then read an additional 150 books, so:

\[ \text{Total books Ezra read} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra read to find the total number of books they have read altogether:

\[ \text{Total books read by both} = \text{Books read by Ahmed} + \text{Total books read by Ezra} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for the hours are:
  \[
  5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75
  \]
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5:
  \[
  \$75 + \$5 = \$80
  \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$30
  \]
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we add her earnings from both days:

- Monday's earnings: \$80
- Wednesday's earnings: \$30

Total earnings for the two days:
\[
\$80 + \$30 = \$110
\]

Therefore, Tanya earned \(\boxed{110}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on. According to the problem, \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects. According to the problem, \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in these 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on these two days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
Thus, the number of rides in these 2 days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days gives the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Isolate \( W \):

\[ 17 - 5 = 3W \]
\[ 12 = 3W \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Subtract the petals dropped from the initial total:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows initially in the bag:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used by John and DeSean from the remaining marshmallows:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows are the ones left to make more S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores each} \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"

- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the quantities in terms of \( z \):
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + s + s + o = 10 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( s \) and \( o \) in terms of \( z \):
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Next, we determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy by subtracting the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number needed:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time Sandy walked over the two days in hours, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total number of cars:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

By the lunch break, half of the cars had left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of tasks John does in a day:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are \(150 \times 1.20 = 180\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works a full 7-day week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.

So, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars in a week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each type of egg and then sum them up.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink Eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow Eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book costs $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound for the weight of the book and $0.08 per mile for the distance to the distribution center.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]

Adding these two costs together gives the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Money lost} = 3.00 - 24 = -21 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21 after the refund and the shipping cost. However, the question asks for the amount of money Milly will lose, which in this context means the absolute value of the negative result.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gave her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has before buying anything is:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

After buying the jeans, the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Then, she buys a bag for $20. The cost for the bag is:

\[ 20 \]

After buying the bag, the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find out the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate for the month. The total monthly production is 50,000 bars.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is \(\boxed{14,000}\) bars."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then multiply by four to find the monthly total.

1. **Time spent writing songs per week:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

2. **Time spent on makeup per week:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.

3. **Time spent recording videos per week:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.

4. **Total time spent on TikTok activities per week:**
   - Total time = Time spent writing songs + Time spent on makeup + Time spent recording videos
   - Total time = 120 minutes + 90 minutes + 72 minutes = 282 minutes.

5. **Total time spent on TikTok activities per month:**
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent per month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 1128 minutes."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs additional items: 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. We need to calculate the cost for the additional items:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:

$129.00 (base installation) + $30.00 (additional mirrors) + $15.00 (additional chandeliers) + $150.00 (additional pictures) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"

   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (in distance per hour).
   - Since three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54v \text{ (distance units)}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for four turtles to cross the highway:**
   - The total speed of four turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \).
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to cover the distance \( D \) is given by:

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the price after the trade-in is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop after receiving help from her mom and her part-time job earnings. This means the total amount of money she currently has, plus the $50 she still needs, should equal the price of the laptop after the trade-in. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 280 = 400 \]

To find the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we subtract 280 from 400:

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 400 - 280 = 120 \]

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. There are 5 students who are good at math only.
2. Let's denote the number of students who are good at both math and English as \( x \).

The total number of students in the class is 20. Out of these, 8 students perform well in English only. Therefore, the number of students who are either good at math only or good at both math and English is:
\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \]

This 12 includes the 5 students who are good at math only and the \( x \) students who are good at both math and English. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5 + x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

To find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

Now, add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of white shirts without collars:**
   - The total number of white shirts is 40.
   - The number of white shirts with collars is 20.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

4. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts without collars is 20.
   - Therefore, the difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Adding the remaining goats in both farms, we get:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

1. **Calculate the cost of the green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green food = \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount = \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red food = \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{123}
\]"
"First, determine the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel. There are 90 rooms in total, so one-half of the rooms is:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:

\[
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes} \]

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes} \]

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year:
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes} \]

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ 96 \text{ homes} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we can derive the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( M = A - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: Let's denote your mom's age as \( M_{mom} \), so \( M_{mom} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + M + M_{mom} = 87 \).

First, substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ A = B - 3 \]
\[ M = A - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]
\[ M_{mom} = 3B - 1 \]

Now substitute these into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find the age of you (A):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough for all the students and some extra glue sticks left over.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.
- She gave 3 oranges to her only son.

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year. We subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. With 50 students each given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we add the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
   \[
   75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23
   \]

So, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays per month is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost:
\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

This $160 is the total amount Keenan pays per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces left is:

\[

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of buying the chickens plus the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of buying the chickens is:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89 \]

However, the question asks for the total amount Isaias bought the chickens for, which we have already calculated as $7000.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

   - Therefore, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. **Determine the number of years until her age is thrice her current age:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age.
   - Her age in \(x\) years will be \(8 + x\).
   - We need this to be thrice her current age, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 24 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 16
   \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.

**Final Answer:**
16"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon: $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken: \(2 \times \frac{10}{5} = 2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples: \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) dollars.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. 

To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

Argo now has 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \( 34 \)."
"Lani initially baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:
\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

These 50 cookies were then placed equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:
\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}

"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11v = 121 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \]
So, the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]
So, the speed of a whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. 

Mark used to make $10 per hour. With a raise of $2 per hour, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month is $80. Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. Then we have:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A + L = 80 \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) + L = 80 \]
\[ 6J + 18J + 30J + L = 80 \]
\[ 54J + L = 80 \]

Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 per time, \( J \) must be a whole number. The only value for \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a whole number and fits within the total earnings of $80 is \( J = 1 \) (since \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) and \( 80 - 54 = 26 \)).

So, if \( J = 1 \):
\[ 54 \times 1 + L = 80 \]
\[ 54 + L = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54 \]
\[ L = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we calculate Christian's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we calculate Harry's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. So, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car each month is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can find the original number of notebooks she had by subtracting 5 from 7:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they both rowed:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the adults. The two children will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the children. Therefore, the total number of bowls consumed is:

\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls, and 4 bowls are consumed, there is no soup left over for the children to have additional bowls for lunch. Therefore, the number of times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - For 20 small masks, the total material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total material for small masks} = 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - For 8 large masks, the total material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total material for large masks} = 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total material needed:**
   - Adding the material needed for the small and large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

   - Therefore, the total number of tickets is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Deepa spent $216 in total.

3. **Calculate the average price per ticket:**
   - The average price per ticket is the total amount spent divided by the total number of tickets.
   - Therefore, the average price per ticket is \( \frac{216}{27} \).

4. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{216}{27} = 8 \).

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and calculate the time spent on each:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Next, we subtract these 6 marbles from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Now, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. We subtract these 10 marbles from the 24 marbles Dean has left:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age. According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm size = 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm = 2 * 200 acres = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm size = 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres both farms have together, we add the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm size + Farmer Smith's farm size
Total acres = 200 acres + 500 acres
Total acres = 700 acres.

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. This is calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in his workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing these 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( r \) and \( y \):
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We also know that \( r = 20 \). Substituting \( r \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( y = 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\[5 + 10 + 8 = 23\]

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the expenses and find out the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had combined, and then determine how much each of them received from their mother.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This means Julia and Nadine had a total of $28 combined. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira initially bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

12 pieces are left."
"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball.

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two activities:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:
\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Profit = \( \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \).

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

The total number of pets is \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat together in one day. This is \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices per day. Therefore, the number of days the loaf will last is \(24 \div 6 = 4\) days.

So, the loaf of bread will last \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in years and then convert it to months.

From age 5 to age 10, she collected shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since she collects one shell every month, over 5 years, she would have collected:

\[5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ shells}\]

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells."
"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
\]

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \).

Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x = 9
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
2x = 9
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Thus, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries picked per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find the number of bouncy balls:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person initially received:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
- Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons:

- Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Now, let's add up all the water balloons:

- Initial balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15

Total number of water balloons = \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff. To find out how many tables are needed in total, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney combined:
- Total distance = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = \( 60 \times 24 \times 30 \)

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = \( 45 \times 24 \times 30 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per month: \( 60 \times 24 \times 30 \)
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Revenue = \( 60 \times 24 \times 30 \times 6 \)

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per month: \( 45 \times 24 \times 30 \)
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Revenue = \( 45 \times 24 \times 30 \times 6 \)

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- **Revenue difference:**
  - Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: \( 60 \times 24 \times 30 \times 6 \)
  - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: \( 45 \times 24 \times 30 \times 6 \)
  - Difference in revenue = \( (60 \times 24 \times 30 \times 6) - (45 \times 24 \times 30 \times 6) \)

Let's calculate the exact values:

- Total widgets produced by Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
  \[
  60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43200
  \]

- Total widgets produced by WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
  \[
  45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32400
  \]

- Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- The number of additional hours is \( 17 - 12 = 5 \) hours.
- The cost for the additional hours is \( 5 \times 70 = 350 \) pesos.

So, the total cost for the 17-hour stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 17-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60
\]

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Number of yams: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17 \text{ hours}} \]"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

2. Subtract 40 from this result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

Therefore, at the end, Jasmine has \(\boxed{13}\) stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times.

- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal.

- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley earns is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo’s age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus’s age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

Therefore, the book has \(\boxed{150}\) pages."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. is 6:00, so 5 minutes earlier is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before going to the bathroom:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes, which is \( 2 \times 60 + 40 = 160 \) minutes.
   - Total time awake before going to the bathroom: \( 60 + 160 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Total time Kim was asleep is her usual sleep duration minus the time she was sleepwalking.
   - \( 480 - 23 = 457 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the time Kim was awake after going to the bathroom:**
   - From 5:55 a.m. to 6 a.m. is 5 minutes.

7. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake that day:**
   - Total time awake is the time before going to the bathroom plus the time after going to the bathroom.
   - \( 220 + 5 = 225 \) minutes.

8. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep that day:**
   - Total time Kim was asleep is the total time she was awake minus the time she was awake after going to the bathroom.
   - \( 480 - 225 = 255 \) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{255}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. This means:

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. The total number of new admissions in 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

**Final Answer: 100**"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we find the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people as \( x \). According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people. This can be expressed as:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of balls each boy carried and then sum them up to find the total number of balls.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We sum the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) in terms of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \, \text{miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[ 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( \boxed{374} \) miles."

   - She received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   - 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies.

3. **Brownies received from the surprise party:**
   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
   - 4 dozen = 48 brownies.

4. **Brownies eaten during the surprise party:**
   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

**Total brownies initially:**
- Brownies made by Greta: 12
- Brownies received from the office party: 6
- Brownies received from the surprise party: 48

\[
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

**Brownies eaten during the surprise party:**
- 18 brownies

**Brownies left over:**
\[
66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\) years. Therefore, the sister's age is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (one for himself, one for his wife, and one for each of his 2 kids).

The price of the first two phones is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the costs of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we know the total number of cherries shared by Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

We can write these as equations:
\[ G_S = 10 \]
\[ A_S = A_U - 4 \]
\[ G_U = G_S + 5 \]
\[ A_U = 15 \]

Now, substitute the known values:
\[ G_S = 10 \]
\[ A_U = 15 \]
\[ G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \]
\[ A_S = 15 - 4 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- Gingerbread cost $6 per box.
- Apple pie cost $15 per box.

Earnings on Saturday:
\[ \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = G_S \times 6 = 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from apple pie} = A_S \times 15 = 11 \times 15 = 165 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 60 + 165 = 225 \]

Earnings on Sunday:
\[ \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = G_U \times 6 = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from apple pie} = A_U \times 15 = 15 \times 15 = 225 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 90 + 225 = 315 \]

Finally, the total earnings for the two days:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 225 + 315 = 540 \]

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{540}\) dollars for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the amount of sunscreen used per day is:
     \[
     1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:**
   - She will be outside for 8 days.
   - The total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days is:
     \[
     4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - The number of bottles required is:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
     - Let the age of Emil's dad at that time be \(D\).
     - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
     - Let the age of Emil's brother at that time be \(B\).
     - Therefore, \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

3. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.
   - Similarly, his brother will be \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

4. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:**
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has a total of 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} + 6 \text{ (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the spacing are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

Now, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00\)
- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is \(3 \div 1 = 3\).

So, they can plant \(\boxed{3}\) roses."
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes each month, which is the amount she sets aside.

\[ \text{Amount spent on shoes each month} = \$500.00 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by the number of months in a year, considering she buys 1 pair every 2 months.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since the peeling and sautering are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the cooling and warming process step by step.

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14 degrees."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - If Bill's dad was \( D \) years old when he saw the comet, and 75 years have passed since then, Bill's age at the second sighting would be \( D + 75 \).
   - We know that at the second sighting, Bill was \( 3D \) years old. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     D + 75 = 3D
     \]

5. **Solve for \( D \):**
   \[
   D + 75 = 3D
   \]
   \[
   75 = 3D - D
   \]
   \[
   75 = 2D
   \]
   \[
   D = \frac{75}{2}
   \]
   \[
   D = 37.5
   \]

6. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, and 75 years have passed since then, Bill's age at the first sighting would be:
     \[
     37.5 - 75 = -37.5
     \]
   - This result is not possible because age cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and the interpretation of the ages.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, it appears there might be an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. However, based on the provided information and the logical steps, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 37.5 years, and the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time is 112.5 years. 

To find Bill's age at the first sighting, we need to subtract 75 years from 112.5 years:
\[
112.5 - 75 = 37.5
\]

Thus, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{37.5}
\]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Twice as long as Tobias's howl, so \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: The combined length of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, so \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total combined length of their howls in seconds:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to use the information about Helene's age being twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

However, the problem also mentions that Walter's friend will give him an additional $200. This amount is not part of the lawyer's contribution but rather a separate donation. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution remains:

\[ 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

The total watermelon can be considered as 1 (or 100%). Therefore, the total size of the slices is equivalent to the watermelon.

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. Since the total watermelon is \( 8x \), the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is \( \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \).

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours
3. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Let's add up the total time required for each step:

- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

**Final Answer:**
2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:**
   - Lisa sold \(3.5\) boxes.
   - Peter sold \(4.5\) boxes.
   - Total boxes sold = \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

2. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - They sold a total of \(64\) chocolate bars.

3. **Calculate the number of chocolate bars per box:**
   - Since \(8\) boxes contain \(64\) chocolate bars, the number of chocolate bars per box is given by:
   \[
   \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
   - Total cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Daily earnings = Total cost per session * Number of sessions per day
   - Daily earnings = $40 * 3 = $120

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has 4 weeks, and the studio is open 3 days a week, the number of days in a month = 4 * 3 = 12 days
   - Monthly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a month
   - Monthly earnings = $120 * 12 = $1440

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$1440**."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[
\frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[
\frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[
16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, 8260 gallons of water are needed to fill the pool.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

The total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

   \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[
\boxed{1875}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{(0.93)^3}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   Solving for \( y \):

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{(0.91)^5}
   \]

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557

"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \$10 \]
\[ \text{Hourly tips} = \$15 \]
\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 20\% \times \$10,000 = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$25 \times 40 = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount of money he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Anne gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends equally, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

1. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day.
2. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If the price per sandwich is $1.5, then the cost of 8 sandwiches is \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she has:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

yellow balloons left. As she neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons (15 red and 6 yellow), the total number of balloons she carried into the school is:

\[ 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: \(50\% = 0.5\)
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.5 \times 100\% = 50\%\)

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: \(50\% = 0.5\)
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: \(40\% = 0.4\)
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.5 \times 0.4 \times 100\% = 20\%\)

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: \(50\% = 0.5\)
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: \(60\% = 0.6\)
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: \(20\% = 0.2\)
   - If Marcus gets a personal extension, he does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 \times 100\% = 6\%\)

Now, we sum up the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 50\% + 20\% + 6\% = 76\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 100\% - 76\% = 24\% \]

**Final Answer:**
24%"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. After reserving 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for tickets to be given to friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Next, we need to distribute these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. The number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the answer.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her net pay per hour by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Therefore, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To set off all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 transitions (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ transitions} \times 5 \text{ seconds/transition} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled.
   - New annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( -5 \) dollars.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.
   - Winning amount in the second race: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) dollars.
   - Gain in the second race: \( +11 \) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \) dollars.
   - Loss in the third race: \( -16.5 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won or lost:

- Total loss: \( -5 + (-16.5) = -21.5 \) dollars.
- Total gain: \( +11 \) dollars.

The net result is:
\[ -21.5 + 11 = -10.5 \] dollars.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5 \]

So, the average loss per race is \( -3.5 \) dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the heights are given in inches and the growth is also in inches.

Xavier's original height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's original height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over 21 days:**
   - Since each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day, over 21 days, each painter worked \(21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8}\) days.

4. **Convert the total fraction of days into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by each painter is \(\frac{63}{8} \times 24\).

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{63}{8} \times 24 = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{1512}{8} = 189
   \]

So, each painter put in \(\boxed{189}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n \) is 3 years.

Let's calculate the value in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is:

"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is **$2400**."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \text{ twin beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- \(1 \text{ king bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do. The laundry machine can handle:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \( \frac{208 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ twin sheets per load}} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \( \frac{52 \text{ king sheets}}{1 \text{ king sheet per load}} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry:

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies in one weekend = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
   - Total movies in one weekend = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = Total movies in one weekend \(\times\) 4
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \).

3. **Silvia's Slices:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Next, we sum the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia to find the total number of slices eaten.

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices}
\]

\[
\text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31
\]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit charge**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: Each painkiller costs $4, and she needs 30 painkillers, so the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking cost**: The parking is charged at $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so the total parking cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs to find the total:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a response, so the number of emails that James needs to respond to each day is:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}
\]"
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
   \[
   100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   \]

2. Add the score of the 4th test:
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of tests (4) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's determine how many pizzas the football team ordered and how many they ate.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. According to the problem, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney now has is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter in total.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the cost for the first pound is $4.00, and the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00. This pattern continues for the total 6 pounds of butter.

To calculate the total cost, we can break it down as follows:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound costs $2.00.
- The third pound costs $4.00.
- The fourth pound costs $2.00.
- The fifth pound costs $4.00.
- The sixth pound costs $2.00.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that 4 people said they could not come. Therefore, the number of people who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left, we can set up the equation for Maggie's original amount of money as follows:
\[ \text{Maggie's original money} - \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Maggie's original money} = 60 \]
Let \( M \) be Maggie's original money. Then:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ M = 80 \]

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, for Riza, who spent one-third of her money and has $60 left, we can set up the equation for Riza's original amount of money as follows:
\[ \text{Riza's original money} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Riza's original money} = 60 \]
Let \( R \) be Riza's original money. Then:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ R = 90 \]

So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left after spending:
- Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) dollars, so she has \(80 - 20 = 60\) dollars left.
- Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30\) dollars, so she has \(90 - 30 = 60\) dollars left.

Adding the remaining amounts together:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the two of them have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can write the equation for the total bananas as:
\[7 \times (10 + 14 + x) = 315\]

Simplify the equation:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[24 + x = 45\]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for \(x\):
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle and then finished another entire 500 piece puzzle.

Half of a 500 piece puzzle is:
\[ \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Teddy placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

The total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the cost of 15 roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy 15 roses at the per-rose price. Therefore, she will buy a dozen roses for $15 and then buy the remaining 3 roses at $2 each.

The cost for a dozen roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for 3 roses is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny has $25, and the total cost is $21, so the change she receives is:
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum up the totals from each item:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach the total of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers bought it for is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 3600 seconds
   - 4 hours = 4 × 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - 5 × 14400 = 72000

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is **72000**."
"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Let's denote Binkie's score as \( B \) and Frankie's score as \( F \). We are given that Binkie's score \( B = 90 \).

The relationship between their scores can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is \( 195 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the halfway point**: Since James's home is 4 miles from the store, the halfway point is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Total distance walked**: James walked 2 miles to the halfway point and then walked back 2 miles to his home. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance he walked is \( 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 \) miles.

3. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

4. **Time calculation**: Time is calculated by dividing the total distance by the speed. So, the time taken is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year.

- The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.

First, calculate the annual growth rate:
\[
\text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, use the annual growth rate to find the growth over 13 years:
\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales over the 6-hour period.

1. Calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Bales made by the farmer} = 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Bales picked up by the truck} = 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales}
   \]

3. Calculate the net number of bales left in the field:
   \[
   \text{Bales left in the field} = \text{Bales made by the farmer} - \text{Bales picked up by the truck} = 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales}
   \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ \text{Total class time per day} = 8 \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

\[ \text{Total class time per week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \text{Extra learning time per week} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total time spent learning in a week:

\[ \text{Total learning time per week} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Total learning time per week in hours} = \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the other children step by step.

1. **First Child's Height:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is:
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Second Child's Height:**
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
   - Therefore, the second child's height is:
     \[
     72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Third Child's Height:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   - Therefore, the third child's height is:
     \[
     74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Fourth Child's Height:**
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.
   - Therefore, the fourth child's height is:
     \[
     69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

The height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is:
  \[
  2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}
  \]

- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is:
  \[
  2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet}
  \]

Next, we add the areas of all the walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[
160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[
\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[
12 \times 12 = 144
\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

The total number of sodas left is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

The probability that the soda Ellen's friend gets is shaken is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours.

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:

\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to calculate how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

This means Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Therefore, over 40 days, he helps:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:

   - There were 12 buses.
   - Total people in buses = \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

2. Calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
   - Each car carried 3 people.
   - There were 20 cars.
   - Total people in cars = \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

3. Add the number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
   - Total people = \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is \(\boxed{480}\)."
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\) hours."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the distance for a round trip:**
   - A round trip means going to his parents and coming back.
   - Distance for a round trip = 2 × Distance for one way
   - Distance for a round trip = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Distance for a round trip
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order, which will help us find the production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's find the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Therefore, the total production of the first four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total production of the five workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find the production rate of the fifth worker in toys per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.
2. **Kris had 16 stickers, which is half of what Luis gave her.** Therefore, Luis gave Kris \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. **Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth and gave the rest to Kris.** This means the 32 stickers Luis gave to Kris were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth originally had **64 stickers**."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we determine the total number of M&M in these 30 ounces:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make \(\boxed{90}\) small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for half the circumference of the earth:**
   - The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.
   - Half of the circumference is:
     \[
     \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Determine how many days it takes for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers:**
   - Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.
   - The number of days required to fly 20,000 kilometers is:
     \[
     \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the expression for \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \(S = 9\), we can find \(C\):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs and Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from these 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's earnings:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach. Given that she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk at this speed:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

   21 + 8 + 3 = 32
   \]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, the equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has is:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which is the minimum temperature Donny can drink.

Let's assume the second mug has a temperature \( T \) degrees. When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that this resulting temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, 18 scoops will require: 
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[

     \]
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory. Therefore, we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the initial investment:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."

   - Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

**Final numerical answer:**
50 miles per hour"
"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket
The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners
The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

Therefore, each person gets:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots from Monday to Friday.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, for the weekend, he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots.

Adding the carrots from weekdays and the weekend together, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots a week.

**Final Answer:**
30"
"First, let's calculate the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \times 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the length of the first song to get the length of the second song:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the lengths of both songs to find the total length of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:
\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \) bottles of juice per person.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- \( \frac{3}{4} \) of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) octuplets.

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \text{ octuplets} \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. There are 2 purple-wearers wearing bows out of the 4 total bow-wearers. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Reports Received Last Week**: 5168 reports.
2. **Reports Received on Monday and Tuesday**: 1907 reports.
3. **Reports Received on Thursday and Friday**: 2136 reports.

First, we calculate the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{1125} \]"
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

He sold this 40 square meters for $50. Next, he sold another 1/4 of his original land. Since the original land is 80 square meters, 1/4 of it is:

\[
\frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
\]

He sold these 20 square meters for $30. Now, we need to find out how much land he has left after these two sales. Initially, he had 80 square meters. After selling 40 square meters, he had:

\[
80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

After selling another 20 square meters, he had:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
\]

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. The total amount from selling the remaining land is:

\[
20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from the three sales:

\[
50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"To find Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his face mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all the children:
- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined total. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350

"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

\[ \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

Now, we add the amount given by Sophia to the amount Jack originally had.

\[ \text{Total amount Jack has now} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting this into the first relationship gives \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides to isolate the term with \( Y \):
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the remaining half is also 6 pints, and the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each of these colors as \(x\). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + x + x = 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 6
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ \text{Additional pods} = 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can wash one cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of it on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can continue to use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage and the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after \(n\) days as \(C_n\).
   - The chalk after \(n\) days can be expressed as \(C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n\).

3. **Find the number of days \(n\) before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - We need to solve the inequality \(2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2\).

   \[
   (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{8}{11}
   \]

   - Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

   \[
   \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
   \]

   - Using the property of logarithms \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\):

   \[
   n \ln(0.8) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
   \]

   - Since \(\ln(0.8)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.8)\) and reverse the inequality:

   \[
   n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.8)}
   \]

   - Calculating the values:

   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.3365
   \]
   \[
   \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231
   \]

   \[
   n > \frac{-0.3365}{-0.2231} \approx 1.508
   \]

   - Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:

   \[
   n = 2
   \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[

\]

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}

The total number of students in the class is:

\[
12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"Mike bought 5 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought first:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Then, we add 2 to this number:

\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

**Final Answer:**
Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's determine how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist. This includes both the teeth that were drilled and the teeth that were capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' total teeth (30) this represents. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

The amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

The refund amount is:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7)
\]

Simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Distribute the 3 and 5:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy in total with $27000. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the total number of books he can buy as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Total number of books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, since Bob distributes the money equally among 3 schools, we need to find out how many books each school can buy. We divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one into the tree.

2. **First Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket, throwing the remaining one back at the tree.

3. **Second Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple back at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket, so he had 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the first throw, he picked up 5 apples and put 4 in his pocket, so he had 1 + 4 = 5 apples in his pocket.
- After the second throw, he picked up 6 apples and put all 6 in his pocket.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

And since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- This totals to \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- This totals to \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to get the total miles run in the week:
- Total miles = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net rate at which Jay is increasing the number of snowballs and then calculate the time required to reach 60 snowballs.

1. **Determine the rate of snowball production:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour (60 minutes).

2. **Determine the rate of snowball melting:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In an hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, in an hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which means \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt in an hour.

3. **Calculate the net rate of snowball production:**
   - Net rate = Rate of production - Rate of melting
   - Net rate = 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs/hour

4. **Determine the time required to have 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find the time \( t \) such that the net production of snowballs equals 60.
   - Using the net rate, we have: \( 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \).
   - Solving for \( t \): \( t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since the 20th anniversary of Digimon:**
   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it has been 20 years since it first came out.

2. **Calculate Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
   - At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old 20 years ago.

3. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since Jim was 4 years old, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since the number of bandages cannot be negative, this means they ran out of bandages and needed to order more. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 28 = 22\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages used: Half a bulk pack = \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This discrepancy suggests a need to recheck the initial conditions or the interpretation. Given the problem's setup, the only way to reconcile this is to consider the initial stock before the first day's usage.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x - 38 + 50 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 - 28 + 50 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \(x + 34 - 25 + 100 = x + 109\)

Given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

This negative value indicates an error in the problem's setup or interpretation. Given the problem's constraints and the logical steps, the correct interpretation should be rechecked. However, based on the problem's setup and the logical steps, the initial number of bandages before the first day's usage should be:

\(\boxed{31}\)"
"First, calculate the cost of the haircut. The difference in hair length is \(10 - 8 = 2\) inches. The cost per inch of the haircut is $30, so the cost of the haircut is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once, earning $3.00.
2. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once, earning $1.50.
3. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason took the trash out twice, earning $0.75 each time. So, for two times, he earned \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\).
4. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, earning $0.50 each time. So, for six times, he earned \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\).

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00

So, the total amount of money Jason earned is \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks as follows:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (morning) had entered. Since 50 people came in the morning, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. The problem states that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\).

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

Adding these together, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is \(8 + 18 = 26\).

Next, let's account for the colors stolen and used up:

- Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(4\) colors are stolen.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors used up.

Subtracting the stolen and used colors from the total:

- Colors stolen: \(4\)
- Colors used: \(3\)

So, the total number of colors subtracted is \(4 + 3 = 7\).

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(26 - 7 = 19\).

**Final Answer: 19**"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor to the ceiling. This height is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor to the ceiling. Therefore, we subtract the height of the first floor to the ceiling from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells after Alphas:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \( 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is \(\boxed{40000}\)."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply that by the price per kilogram.

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas:
   - First tuna: 56 kilograms
   - Second tuna: 46 kilograms
   - Third tuna: 26 kilograms

   Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

2. Calculate the total earnings:
   - Price per kilogram of tuna: $0.50

   Total earnings = Total weight × Price per kilogram
                  = 128 × 0.50
                  = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"First, calculate the total number of water balloons filled:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon to find out how many were thrown:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, they threw:

\[ 288 \text{ balloons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of medicine used in one dose.

1. The amount of the first medicine in one dose is 14 mL.
2. The amount of the second medicine in one dose is 3 times the first medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, we determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's school is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children:

Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, so:
\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Tim was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people on the bus (270) exceeds the bus's capacity. Therefore, the bus is already full, and no more people can enter.

**Final numerical answer**: 0 people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus because the bus is already at full capacity."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of visits Pauline made over the 8 years. She visits the museum 3 times a year, so over 8 years, the total number of visits is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on these visits. With each visit costing $5, the total cost is:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room:**
   - There are 10 students in each grade with the most points.

   - Total cost = $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the total cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - Cost per minute for the first 16 minutes = $0.25
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - Total call duration = 36 minutes
   - Minutes after the first 16 minutes = 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes
   - Cost per minute for the remaining 20 minutes = $0.20
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. **Total cost of the 36-minute call:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \) and the number of brownies as \( b \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

Each of the five people in the class gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c = 12 \]
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a pedicure is $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art to each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:

"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[
36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the total number of magazines she receives:
\[
3 \text{ magazines} + 1 \text{ magazine} + 1 \text{ magazine} = 5 \text{ magazines}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December after an 80% increase:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.
   - 80% of $40 is calculated as \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

2. **Calculate the price in January after a 50% decrease:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.
   - 50% of $72 is calculated as \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 standard 1-hour lessons. His standard rate is $80 per hour, so for 4 lessons, he earns:

\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate. We calculate 75% of $80 as follows:

\[ 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since Charlie gives 2 1-hour lessons to veterans, the total earnings from these lessons are:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \boxed{440} \]"

\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away \(\boxed{15}\) pomelos."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

"Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that this distance represents.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. We need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that this distance represents.**

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, the total number of grapes is unknown, but we can represent it as \( G \). After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes are:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = G - 36 \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the grapes used for the pies are the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used theirs, we can set up the equation:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

To find the initial number of grapes \( G \), we solve the equation:

\[ G = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

So, the initial number of grapes was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of teachers who were not sick.
2. Subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.

Let's break it down:

1. Total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School: 82
2. Number of teachers who were sick: 13
3. Number of substitute teachers called in: 9

First, we calculate the number of teachers who were not sick:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the number of teachers at school that day is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs Bud incurs for making macaroni and cheese each week:

1. **Pasta cost**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cheddar cheese cost**: $3.00.
3. **Gruyere cheese cost**: Twice the amount spent on cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up the total weekly cost:
\[
1.00 \text{ (pasta)} + 3.00 \text{ (cheddar cheese)} + 6.00 \text{ (gruyere cheese)} = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost for one year (52 weeks) is:
\[
10.00 \text{ dollars/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 520.00 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[
\boxed{520}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe.

To find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) and the total time available in a day (480 minutes):

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

However, this result indicates the total time required to clean all classrooms in terms of the daily working hours, not the average percentage of the day spent cleaning. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean, the average percentage of the day spent cleaning is:

\[ \text{Average percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \times 480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Average percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{2400} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Average percentage of day spent cleaning} = 0.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Average percentage of day spent cleaning} = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends, on average, 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[ 15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at $1/3 per egg is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[
\text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price per bag after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions from both tests.

The first test has 70 questions, and she needs to get 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \text{ questions correct} \]

The second test has 40 questions. Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test as \( x \).

The total number of questions from both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of these 110 questions correct:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \text{ questions correct} \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct from the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

So, Jason needs to make \(\boxed{750}\) telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (personal flashlights)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (flashlights for rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20
     \]

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in total.
   - Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (rooms with small candles)} \times 4 \text{ (candles per room)} + 4 \text{ (rooms with medium candles)} \times 5 \text{ (candles per room)} = 16 + 20 = 36

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes is given by the total number of words divided by the speaking speed:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Number of people = 50

2. **Second Day:**
   - Number of people = 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Third Day:**
   - Number of people = 2 * 70 = 140

4. **Rest of the Week (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Days):**
   - Average number of people per day = 60
   - Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 4 = 240

5. **Total Number of People for the Week:**
   - Sum of people from all days = 50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week)

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we sum the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade and then convert that into the number of lemons.

1. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the regular lemonade:**

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. **Red Candies**: Given as 54.
2. **Orange Candies**: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
3. **Yellow Candies**: Half the amount of red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Next, we sum the quantities of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the sum of the other colored candies from the total:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. Therefore, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):

Next, calculate the earnings from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, calculate the earnings from selling the other 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Matthew would earn \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine the net change in the number of holes each day after Nate gets home. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, resulting in a net change of:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of test tubes Igor gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Determine the number of beakers Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
   - Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Determine the number of beakers Igor lost:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered 5 beakers.
   \[
   \text{Number of beakers lost} = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) eggs. 

Adding the eggs from both baskets together: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
- Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

From this, we can calculate Aaron's speed:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total required.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line required.
Since the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night's reservations.

- Each meal costs $5, and they order 2 meals per reservation.
- Therefore, the cost of meals per reservation is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
- So, the total cost per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night is:
\[6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars}\]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total cost for the week is:
\[90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount they make in a week is:
\(\boxed{180}\)"
"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Final answer:
\[
8
\]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's work} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices available:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine the number of people sharing the pizzas:

\[ 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ friends} = 4 \text{ people} \]

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
