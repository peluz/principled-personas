"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts."
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the value of the house increased by 1.5 times its original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. So, the increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the project, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
540 meters"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total daily)} - 40 \text{ cups (morning and afternoon)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 such pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can use the information provided to find out how many sheep Charleston and Toulouse have.

1. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
   \[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
   \[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:
\[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} \]
\[ \text{Total sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update restart + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in standstill - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance from the first leg + Distance from the return journey = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is the total distance he has traveled minus the initial 180 miles he drove away from home.
   - Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance = 315 miles - 180 miles = 135 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 135 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. **Regular Hours (First 40 hours):**
   - Rate: $10 per hour
   - Total for regular hours: \(40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400\)

2. **Overtime Hours (Hours beyond 40):**
   - Overtime hours: \(45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}\)
   - Overtime rate: \(1.2 \times \$10 = \$12\) per hour
   - Total for overtime hours: \(5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60\)

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
   - Total earnings = \$400 + \$60 = \$460

Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen: $68.
   - Total cost for donuts: \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen: $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen: $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

Now, we sum up the total costs:
- Total cost for donuts: $204
- Total cost for mini cupcakes: $160
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes: $330

Total cost: \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\).

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- Cost to plant the tree: $90 (one-time cost)
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3

Next, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Number of lemons grown per year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5

Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after accounting for the annual maintenance cost:
Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
Number of years to break even = Initial cost / Net profit per year
Number of years to break even = $90 / $7.5 = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there.
5. After selling at the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, and we know this is equal to 5 vacuum cleaners.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

Final answer: 18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. So, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop dance students by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry: $125
- Electronic Gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final Answer:**

"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour for teaching.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week}\).
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are \( \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year}\).

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour for coaching.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching are \(15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week}\).
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are \( \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year}\).

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary = \( \$35,000 + \$22,500 = \$57,500 \).

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is \$57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs.

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens by dividing by 12. So, \(84 \div 12 = 7\).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items we know the quantity and price of.

2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the known items:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 60 - 15 = 45th mile.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile he stopped at first from the mile he stopped at second:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on walking and taking care of the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week to get the weekly hours.

Step 1: Daily hours
Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs.
So, the daily hours spent are \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

Step 2: Weekly hours
There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us two equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total amount from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the cost of the video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the calculation checks out, we now need to determine how many lego sets John still has. The problem states that he sold all his lego sets initially, so he should have no lego sets left. However, the question seems to imply a misunderstanding or a trick, as it asks how many lego sets he still has after the transactions. Given the information, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and this is half as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in the six-hour period. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin. Since 1200 feet is outside the dragon's reach, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package she purchased.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Remaining Post-it notes: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + 23) - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 103 - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = -117 \]

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation because the number of Post-it notes can't be negative. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. She had 23 Post-it notes left.

So, the correct equation should be:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 220 + 23 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can obtain:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

30"
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the kittens from the shelter to the kittens from the house cats:

7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

The final numerical answer is:
40"

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are loaded.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity.

First, let's find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge. The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is:

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the 21st to 30th year, she will receive the base pension plus 5% of the base pension. 

5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, the additional amount she will receive per year after 20 years is $2,500. 

Adding this to the base pension:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays the full monthly rate of $140 for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than the full monthly rate, which is $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126 per month for 6 months.

Now, let's calculate the total for each half of the year and then sum them up.

First half of the year:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Second half of the year:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the fuel efficiency we calculated:

\[ \text{Miles per tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up all the gems:
\[ 175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received as her weekly allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so the total revenue is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\boxed{7425}\) dollars in one week."
"To prepare the two dishes, Kelian has to read the instructions from both recipes. The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we add the instructions from both recipes together:

\[20 + 40 = 60\]

Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the interest for each cell phone. Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for one cell phone is:

\[ 2\% \times \$150 = 0.02 \times \$150 = \$3 \]

So, the total interest for all five cell phones is:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$3 \text{ per cell phone} = \$15 \]

Adding the total interest to the original total cost gives us the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount in 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Level 4: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4}
\]

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

The average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days of the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
   - David does 100 pounds of laundry.
   - The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Savings = Cost of buying in packages of 2 - Cost of buying in packages of 3
- Savings = $9.00 - $15.00 = -$6.00 (This negative value indicates that buying in packages of 2 is more expensive, so we need to re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are using the better price correctly.)

Upon re-evaluation, it's clear that the better price is buying in packages of 3 for $2.50 each. Therefore, the correct calculation for savings is:
- Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the final cost after the discount, we first need to find out the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original cost.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The original cost is $100.
   - The discount is 30% of $100.
   - Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30.

2. Subtract the discount from the original cost:
   - Final cost = Original cost - Discount amount
   - Final cost = $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary increase for each of the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary for each of the next three years.**

The salary increases by 10% each year. We need to apply this increase for three consecutive years.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ friends don't show up} \]

Therefore, the number of friends who are expected to attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ friends} \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ gift bags} \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. **Adult Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**
   - Sum of the amounts for adults and children: \( 200 + 25 = 225 \) lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

\[4 + 6 + 18 = 28\]

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To find out how old Jackson is, let's use the information given to set up equations and solve for Jackson's age.

1. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey.
   - So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10% of his original time. We can calculate the reduction in time as:

\[ \text{Reduction in time} = 10\% \times \text{Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald's new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Reduction in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The remaining students are girls. So, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans used is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
3. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
5. Since 25 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes and 20 of them are accounted for, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is \(25 - 20 = 5\).

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Subtracting the potted plants she will give away from her total, we get:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, which is 5 days a week. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 15 glasses of water.

On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and has a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on Saturday and 3 glasses of water on Sunday.

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:

15 (from weekdays) + 3 (Saturday) + 3 (Sunday) = 21

John drinks 21 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given about the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 500 \]"

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched each day and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) 30-minute episodes (which is \(0.5x\) hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total hours of TV watched is 7 hours. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine the known hours:

\[5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 2\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 4\]

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year."
"To calculate the final cost after the cashback, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Final cost after cashback
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is \$28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total eaten = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by 2:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat over 80 feet, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Each lesson uses the whiteboard.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days. So, the total number of flowers planted is:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is also 50% higher than the original price of $16:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid \(\$360\)."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, which totals to 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. 

To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles:

30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 (vehicles added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container to find the number of containers added:

20 (vehicles added) / 5 (vehicles per container) = 4 (containers added on the second day)

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - This simplifies to \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming the same percentage increase as Adrien (40%), Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper on each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper a week.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so in a month, Miguel uses \(60 \times 4 = 240\) sheets of paper.

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples. 
Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Total apples: \(5 + 10 = 15\)
- Total oranges: \(8 + 4 = 12\)

Total fruits: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

Therefore, they have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 46 hours

"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the distance covered in the next 4 hours is:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Final numerical answer:

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Total amount of money he will spend: $880.**"
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

Therefore, his total expenditure for those two months was $940."
"Pam and Fred each rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

For the roller coaster:
- Pam rode 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Fred rode 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.

For the luge:
- Both Pam and Fred rode 2 times each, so together they used \(2 \times 6 + 2 \times 6 = 12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Adding the tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge:
- Total tickets used = \(12 + 24 + 24 = 60\).

Therefore, they used 60 tickets that day."

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Next, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total questions left incomplete} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = \frac{4B}{2} + \frac{2B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Solving for B:
\[ 7B = 1400 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Now, using the relationship \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\$140\) in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items after tax:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Total cost of everything = Cost of food items + Cost of non-food items after tax
Total cost of everything = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

Final numerical answer:
16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: John has 100 pineapples per hectare. Since he has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Step 2: John can harvest every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: The total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees from the first 6 hours plus the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours return in the last 6 hours, which totals 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - 22 = 8 \]

To find the amount given, we add 22 to both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Amount given} = 8 + 22 \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Now, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

1. **Steve's Time:**
   - Distance: 3 miles
   - Speed: 440 feet per minute
   - Convert miles to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

2. **Tim's Time:**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 264 feet per minute
   - Convert miles to feet: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

**Final Answer:**
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, we get 500 cents / 100 = $5.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5 that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the change Carl receives is $4.00."
"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since the ants carried off 1 fry).
3. **Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole as \( x \). The raccoon stole two-thirds, so one-third remained. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).
4. **Before the three pigeons ate their share**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate \( 2y \). The seagull ate \( y \) fries, and Dave ate \( 2y \) fries, so before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + y + 2y = 27 + 3y \) fries. After the seagull ate, there were \( 27 - y \) fries left. We know that \( 27 - y = 14 \) (since Dave ate 14 fries). Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = 27 - 14 = 13 \). Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 3 \times 13 = 27 + 39 = 66 \) fries.
6. **Before Dave ate his fries**: Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate, there were \( 66 + 14 = 80 \) fries.

Thus, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Over three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day.
- Over two days, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- Total semester hours = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer needs to be in feet, we'll convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length of all the baked goods:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we first need to determine the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly requirement:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of each item he bought and then sum them up.

1. The cost of 4 pens at $1.5 each:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \]

2. The cost of 2 notebooks at $4 each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

3. The cost of the rim of bond paper:
\[ 20 \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, which means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, he can see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, he can see 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, we add the total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

Final numerical answer:
32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $787.32."
"Given that one red car costs $4 and an action figure costs $5, we can determine the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the doll's cost is:

\[ 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:

- 5 red cars at $4 each: \( 5 \times \$4 = \$20 \)
- 3 action figures at $5 each: \( 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \)
- 1 doll at $15: \( \$15 \)

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:

\[ \$20 + \$15 + \$15 = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:

\[ \$50 \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 per hour for 3 hours.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1497 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €3."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs required by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we can now find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate Jimmy's money as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

1. For the spiders:
   - There are 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders = 80 * 8 = 640 legs.

2. For the insects:
   - There are 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects = 90 * 6 = 540 legs.

3. For the rare mutant invertebrates:
   - There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = 640 (spiders) + 540 (insects) + 30 (rare mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\)

The total age of the four birds is 41."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for both peeling and cutting each potato.

1. Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we calculate the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting:

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   - He gives his daughter 200 dollars.
   - He gives his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have \(\boxed{350}\) dollars."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation for Mark's age two years ago as:
   \[
   \text{Mark's age two years ago} = \frac{28}{2} + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
4. This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
5. We are also told that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time - the less well-rounded team's total time = 220 seconds - 222 seconds = -2 seconds.

Since the result is negative, it means the faster team actually finishes 2 seconds before the less well-rounded team. Therefore, the faster team wins by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
2 seconds"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total to find the straw given to the rats.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \(r\) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - The total number of rats is \(3r\).
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).
   - We know this total is 90 pieces, so we set up the equation \(18r = 90\).
   - Solving for \(r\), we get \(r = \frac{90}{18} = 5\).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest compounded over the 3 months.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**After 1st Month**:
- Interest for 1st month = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1st month = $100 + $2 = $102

**After 2nd Month**:
- Interest for 2nd month = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2nd month = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**After 3rd Month**:
- Interest for 3rd month = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3rd month = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price per bag for the trader is $20 (purchase cost) + $2 (transport cost) = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The profit per bag is therefore $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit made by the trader is $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we can use the formula for total profit:

\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Profit per bag} \times \text{Number of bags} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 400 = 8 \times x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 = \$12.00 \]

2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 6 tests, after removing the lowest score.
2. Determine the lowest score from the first five tests.
3. Subtract the lowest score from the total sum needed.
4. Solve for the score on the sixth test.

First, let's calculate the total sum of scores needed for an average of 93 over 6 tests:
\[ \text{Total sum needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Next, we identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
\[ 71, 86, 89, 92, 100 \]
The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total sum needed:
\[ 558 - 71 = 487 \]

This means the sum of the remaining five scores (including the sixth test score) must be 487. We already know four of these scores:
\[ 86, 89, 92, 100 \]
Let's sum these four scores:
\[ 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 367 \]

To find the score needed on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the four known scores from 487:
\[ 487 - 367 = 120 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 120 on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.
Sara already has $10 saved, so her total earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn, plus her savings, are $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn so that her total earnings are at least $70. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \(t\) he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (perimeter of the park) and the speed:
\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age = 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age = 21 * 2 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age = 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle. 

For the crossword puzzles:

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip will be the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

- Initial number of fire type cards: 30
- Initial number of grass type cards: 20
- Initial number of water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- New number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
- Total number of cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's sum these amounts:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."

1. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces:**
   - Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
   - Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 / 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of placing pieces:**
   - Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.
   - At a combined rate of 6 pieces per minute, the time required to complete the puzzle is \(360 / 6 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, 60 minutes is equal to \(60 / 60 = 1\) hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons that became ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of these newly harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the final number of watermelons not ready for harvest.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months:**
   - Total watermelons = 120
   - Percentage ready for harvest = 30%
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 30% of 120 = 0.30 * 120 = 36

2. **Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total:**
   - Remaining watermelons after two months = 120 - 36 = 84

3. **Calculate the number of watermelons that became ready for harvest after two weeks:**
   - Fraction of remaining watermelons ready for harvest = 3/4
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks = 3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63

4. **Subtract the number of these newly harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons:**
   - Watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks = 84 - 63 = 21

**Final answer:**
21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are left sunbathing after some of them have left to swim in the ocean or go to the cave to eat.

1. First, we calculate one-third of the 36 penguins that jump in the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

2. Next, we calculate one-third of the 36 penguins that go to the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go to the cave.

3. Now, we add the number of penguins that left to find the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing:
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]

4. Finally, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the original number of penguins to find how many are still sunbathing:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram can effectively get more pens by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This means he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the ink of the 25 pens he used.
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 25 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 30 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This means he can make 30 / 5 = 6 new pens from the ink of the 30 pens he used.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 6 new pens plus the 30 pens that were refilled, making a total of 36 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This means he can make 36 / 5 = 7 new pens (with 1 pen left over, but we only count full pens here).

Adding all these together, the total number of pens Ram gets is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 pens from the first cycle, plus the 6 pens from the second cycle, plus the 7 pens from the third cycle. 

So, the total number of pens is:
25 (initial) + 5 (first cycle) + 6 (second cycle) + 7 (third cycle) = 43 pens.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
43"
"Johnny initially took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount of money he had was:

"Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can determine the ages of Joan and Mary as follows:

1. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages together:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read her two books plus Pandora's one book, which totals 3 books. Pandora will read her one book plus Dolly's two books, which also totals 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, and each book is read by at least one person, we simply add the number of books Dolly has to the number of books Pandora has, which is 2 + 1 = 3 for Dolly and 1 + 2 = 3 for Pandora, but since we are counting the total unique books read, it is simply 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books read by Dolly and 1 book read by Pandora, making a total of 3 unique books read.

Final numerical answer:
3"
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, he receives 30 pages a week (3 people * 10 pages).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.

To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total time spent writing 30 pages. Mike writes a page every 6 minutes.

Total time spent writing 30 pages = 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin ends up with \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:
- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:
- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into three equal parts. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of onions the chef bought.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pound.

Step 1: Total weight of onions
The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds.
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Step 2: Total cost
The cost of one pound of onions is $1.50.
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Sue's total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies
- Sue's sister's total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the sister's total calories from Sue's total calories:
\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(30\) girls in total.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has \(20 - 15 = 5\) boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has \(20 - 12 = 8\) boys.
6. The total number of boys in the first and second classes is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
7. Since there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is \(30 - 13 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Thus, today Rick killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's sum up the total number of animals killed over the two days:

- Wolves: \( 10 + 36 = 46 \)
- Cougars: \( 15 + 12 = 27 \)

Total animals killed: \( 46 + 27 = 73 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so 30% of 30 is:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel, which means:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times. Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

Since we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\(22 \times 8 = 176\).

Therefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, they ate:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Since Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200 \text{ pennies} \]

Since 100 pennies make a dollar, we convert 6200 pennies to dollars:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

Therefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

3. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Now, we subtract these amounts from the selling price to find the net proceeds.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Transfer Fees} - \text{Brokerage Fee} - \text{Remaining Loan Amount} \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 12,000 - 20,000 - 250,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 118,000 \]

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the additional heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost for newspaper ads: $250
- Total cost for television ads: $1125
- Therefore, the total amount spent on all the ads is \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

\[ (M + 10) + (m + 10) = M + m + 20 \]

Since \( M + m = 20 \), we substitute this into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \text{Sam is 6 years old.} \]"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the guests total to 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people is 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, if each pizza costs $15, the total cost for 13 pizzas is 13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length available for the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads can fit into the 17 inches of space, we divide the available length by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is currently twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is \(9 \times 2 = 18\) years old.

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtract the stars in the other rows to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of medals given out:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 bars are to be shared equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate how much money Susan earns, let's first determine the total time she works and then calculate her earnings based on her rate.

1. **Total Working Time Calculation:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. **Convert Working Time to Minutes:**
   - 2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 minutes = 150 minutes.

3. **Calculate Earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes.
   - In 150 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is 150 / 10 = 15.
   - Therefore, her earnings = 15 * $5 = $75.

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. **Mike's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 21 points
   - Extra points in the fourth round: Since Mike has over 20 points, he gets 1 extra point.
   - Total points for Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points

2. **Jim's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 3 points less than Mike, so 21 - 3 = 18 points
   - Extra points in the fourth round: Since Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, he does not get an extra point.
   - Total points for Jim: 18 points

3. **Tony's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 2 times more than Mike, so 21 * 2 = 42 points
   - Extra points in the fourth round: Since Tony has over 20 points, he gets 1 extra point.
   - Total points for Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner. So, the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Step 4: To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are $250, $300, and $350.
3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids are $400, $450, and $500.

Now, let's sum up all the bids:

- Opening bid: $200
- First bid by others: $250
- First bid by Carmen: $400
- Second bid by others: $300
- Second bid by Carmen: $450
- Third bid by others: $350

So, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is $2450."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so the total mileage charge for the year is \(15000 \times 2 = \$30000\).

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = \$1800\).

3. **Total Cost:**

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings with the bonus.
4. Determine the number of weeks in April.
5. Calculate his total earnings for April.

Step 1: Watson's daily earnings
Watson earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day.
Daily earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day

Step 2: Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus
Watson works 5 days a week.
Weekly earnings without bonus = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Step 3: Watson's weekly earnings with the bonus
Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Step 4: Number of weeks in April
April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 5: Total earnings for April
Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which Sandy loses weight:

If 4 weeks = 2 pounds, then \( x \) weeks = 8 pounds.

So, \( x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/4 weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/4 weeks}} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 16 \text{ weeks} \).

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people eating different amounts of eggs:**
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption:**
   - For the 3 people eating 3 eggs each: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\).
   - For the 2 people eating 2 eggs each: \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\).
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:
120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He initially had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[ \frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

**8 women are left at the party.**"
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for the pencils Jam has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have together:
\[ \text{Total pencils Jam has} + \text{Total pencils Meg has} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the 24 pencils in Jam's boxes, we can assume each box holds 24 pencils. 

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total cooling effect and the corresponding weakening of the coffee.

First, we know that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes she used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling effect of one ice cube:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). Adding these to the remaining lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the $43 purchase to find out how much the customer paid:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A)."

1. Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
2. Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (the other one) has 5 guns. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Richard, and Jason), so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many each would have if shared equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns if they shared their guns equally.

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Therefore, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

The final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (assuming June has 30 days).

First, let's find out the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than his current daily distance of 5000 meters. So, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we add this additional distance to his current daily distance to find out the new daily distance:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to find out the total distance Tyson runs in June. Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, that's:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, that's:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, to find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies taken by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in a bag:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue between the current and past production.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.**
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.**
- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue.**
- Difference in daily revenue = $1100/day (silos) - $1000/day (tractors) = $100/day.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**
- Percentage increase = (Difference in daily revenue / Original daily revenue) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

   - Therefore, the annual cost is \( 220 \times 12 = 2640 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, let's break down each activity and calculate the time spent on each:

1. **Monday's Yoga Class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's Cooking Class**: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Wednesday's Cheese-Tasting Event**: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
4. **Thursday's Museum Tour**: Half as long as the cooking class, so \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours
5. **Friday's Errands**: 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

\[1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 8 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is 8 hours."
"April is donating plant pots for the daisies and roses. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means:

- Daisies: 30 plant pots
- Roses: 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots

So, the total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10 plant pots

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

1. Andrea had $36 initially.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, subtract this total from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of the items:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the items, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's assume Morgan is one of the people attending the party. We need to find out how much money is left for her friends after accounting for her own expenses.

5. **Morgan's total cost**: $30
6. **Total budget**: $90
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to cover the cost of $30 (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens).

8. **Number of friends Morgan can invite**: $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

The amount she saves each day is the difference between her pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

So, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the $2 he spent is half of his change.
   - Therefore, his total change before buying gumballs = $2 * 2 = $4.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10 and had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Amount spent on candy = $10 - $4 = $6.

4. **Determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = $6 / $1.5 = 4 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the total of 42 points.

Jane's scores so far are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
15 + 18 = 33 points

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points:
42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for the other reasons from the total:
   \[
   50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 18
   \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - For 44 seniors, the total cost for picture frames and etching = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, summing up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames and etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

The total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper would be:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Number of Months}}{12}\right) \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. We know that the amount of land he kept is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Final numerical answer:
16"

\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Total messages delivered: 88"
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- Savings = Cost for Dasha - Cost for David
- Savings = $36 - $30 = $6

So, David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount:

The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services:

The cost of the streaming services is $24 per month, and the original cable package cost $60 per month. Therefore, the savings per month are:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:

Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing:

Percentage spent editing = \( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \times 100 \)

Substituting the values:

Percentage spent editing = \( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \times 100 = 20\% \)

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song."

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards she has:

- She started with 50 cards.
- She gave away 29 cards.
- She received 17 cards.

The net change is \(50 - 29 + 17 = 38\).

Therefore, Erica now has \(\boxed{38}\) Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs she saw:

\[ 90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"

"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Total number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

"Given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he already had. So, the new number of cannolis and corns are:

New number of cannolis = 40 (original) + 60 (bought)
New number of cannolis = 100

New number of corns = 80 (original) - 40 (fewer)
New number of corns = 40

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

Total = New number of cannolis + New number of corns
Total = 100 + 40
Total = 140

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, let's calculate the total steps he had completed before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, the total steps he aimed to take (10,000) minus the steps he had left (2,000) gives us the steps he took during his jog:
- Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%
- We need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that might explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can assume that the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be the product of the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog and the percentage of candles that might explode, applied to the total number of candles.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = \left(\frac{5}{100} \times \frac{1}{100}\right) \times 50,000 = \left(\frac{5}{10000}\right) \times 50,000 = \frac{250,000}{10000} = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount price of each blouse and then multiply it by the number of blouses Misha picked.

1. Calculate the discount price of each blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is \(20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per blouse is \(20 - 6 = 14\) dollars.

2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is \(4 \times 14 = 56\) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:

\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:

\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Climbing distance = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Climbing distance = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has \(\boxed{17000}\) in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans. He saved 1/3 of this total from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means he saved $2 on the jogger jeans. Since the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans before the sale was:

\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. Therefore, the difference is:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder. We know that each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade feeders and 3 store-bought feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket ($100) to cover. So, the money he gets from selling the cards is $150 (because $150 - $50 = $100).

Therefore, we have:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs each. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog each.

2. The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

4. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, and 40 guests each want a second hot dog, we need to calculate how many second hot dogs are available:
   - 54 hot dogs - 40 first hot dogs = 14 second hot dogs available

5. Therefore, 40 - 14 = 26 guests did not get a second hot dog.

Final numerical answer:
26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. 

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00 \]

Now, the items are 20% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times $165.00 = $33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ $132.00 \]"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to determine how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora currently has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces are eaten. Since the cake was divided equally into 8 pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time. However, we need to account for the difference in travel time. Wayne leaves and arrives in 4 minutes, while Bernadette needs 16 minutes to arrive. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 = 12 minutes before Wayne.

To summarize, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

For Elizabeth:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

For Margareth:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Therefore, one sister (Margareth) has 80 more beads than the other (Elizabeth)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.**

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.**

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.**

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( ($15 + P) - $21 = $2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( $15 + P - $21 = $2 \)
   - \( P - $6 = $2 \)
   - \( P = $2 + $6 \)
   - \( P = $8 \)

The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost is:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide this total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the order cost. The order cost is $15.

Tip amount = 1/5 * $15 = $3

Now, we add the tip amount to the order cost to get the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Order cost + Tip amount
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible positive spot, which is 5th place (since there are only 10 spots in a race).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(5 + 2 = 7\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(7 - 3 = 4\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(4 + 1 = 5\).

So, Finley finished in 5th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, so for two people, it is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together gives the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on his player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Now, we divide this sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ \$12 - \$4 = \$8 \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ \frac{\$8}{\$2 \text{ per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we first need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after the discount and coupon is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

5. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid. According to the problem, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid is simply the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food:
\[ \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per person for the venue plus the cost of food, but since the food is already included, the total cost is just the cost per person for the venue:
\[ \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn, so she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the amounts used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Cherrie has 5 friends in total.
2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each. So, for these 2 friends, the total number of gifts is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, for these 3 friends, the total number of gifts is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
4. Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Gifts for the 2 friends: 10
- Gifts for the 3 friends: 6
- Additional random gifts: 10

Total number of gifts = \(10 + 6 + 10 = 26\).

Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet wide}
   \]

2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the couch is:
   \[
   16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

The couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for the week without a pass would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost of her bus trips for the week would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From the first point, if the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have half that number of cows, which is not directly relevant to the number of sheep and cows we are given.

From the second point, if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have half that number of sheep, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's sum up the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep + (the number of cows, which is not specified but not needed for the total animal count) = 20 sheep.

Adding the animals from both the farm and the zoo:

40 (farm's animals) + 20 (zoo's sheep) = 60 animals.

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 60 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market."
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose 30 lbs.
   - Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th.
   - The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July (up to the 19th): 19 days

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Calculate the remaining money after buying clothes.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs.
4. Calculate the remaining money after buying CDs.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on clothes.**

Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying clothes.**

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on CDs.**

Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining money after buying CDs.**

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold each bag for $8. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is \(\$160\)."

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many strawberries as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \, \text{per week} \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her additional daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 48 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Adding this to her current daily consumption:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} + 48 \, \text{kWh/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take that person 10 days. 

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the same house. Since the work is divided among 5 people, the time required would be reduced by a factor of 5.

So, the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house would be:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours required for 5 people to paint a whole house would be:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if we let the number of chairs Ophelia has be \( C \), then \( C = 20 + 2 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has \( 3 \times 22 = 66 \) chairs.

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Since Jenna has 66 chairs, she has \( 66 - 2 = 64 \) sofas.

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.
   - Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 = 84 \).
   - Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 = 88 \).
   - Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set.

Given:
- Cost of one CD = $4
- Total amount paid = $48

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can calculate the number of CDs he could buy with $48 by dividing $48 by the cost of one CD:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set."
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and he worked out for 5 hours for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours for one week, we have:

- 5 weeks of 4 hours each (since 8 weeks - 2 weeks - 1 week = 5 weeks)

The total hours for these 5 weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And the hours for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

Now, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin is currently. Since this will happen in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55 to find the cousin's current age:

Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

Finally, to find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors would be \( 2M \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to represent this:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the monitors} + \text{Cost of the printer} = \$2,400 \]
\[ \$1,100 + 2M + \$700 = \$2,400 \]

Combining the known costs:

\[ \$1,800 + 2M = \$2,400 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we solve for \( M \):

\[ 2M = \$2,400 - \$1,800 \]
\[ 2M = \$600 \]
\[ M = \frac{\$600}{2} \]
\[ M = \$300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

60 (number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Each girl brought 300 seashells.

**Final Answer: Anne is 8 years old.**"
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10.
   - Therefore, the total bill including the tip is $50 + $10 = $60.

2. **Determine how the bill is split:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between you and your wife, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Half of $60 = $60 / 2 = $30.

So, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount he has now is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of the month would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, the sum of the savings from both halves of the month should equal $1125:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we can follow these steps:

3. Subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total to find the difference.

Step 1: Jairus's total
Jairus gets $0.8 per task. For 20 tasks, he gets:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Jenny's total
Jenny gets $0.5 per task. For 20 tasks, she gets:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Difference
The difference between Jairus's and Jenny's totals is:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, making it 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week would be:

"Elise writes the full alphabet twice and half of it once. The English alphabet has 26 letters.

- Writing the full alphabet twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters
- Writing half of the alphabet once: \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters

After writing these, she re-writes everything she has already written. So, she re-writes \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(65\)."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, as each round of calls multiplies the number of families notified by a factor of 3.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the number of toys in James's play set. According to the problem, James's play set has 80 toys.

2. Jonathan wants to have a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan wants to have is:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this number. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of toys Jonathan needs is:
   \[
   x + 2
   \]

4. We know that \( x + 2 \) should be equal to 400, the number of toys Jonathan wants to have. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:

\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

So, Bill will need to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we calculate the total time for each scenario:

- On a cold day, the time to swim 3 miles is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- On a hot day, the time to swim 3 miles is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

The total angle the sun moves upward in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at 32 degrees from the ground, and moves 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is:
\[ \boxed{82} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since each son needs a candle for each year of their age, we add the ages of both sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time for the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final answer:
10"
"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63.

Now, to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the daily spending amount:**
   Peter has $70 to spend over 7 days, so he spends:
   \[
   \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total spending from Sunday to Wednesday:**
   From Sunday to Wednesday is 4 days, so he spends:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining money for the rest of the week:**
   After spending $40, he has:
   \[
   70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total spending from Thursday to Sunday:**
   From Thursday to Sunday is 4 days, so he spends:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   However, he only has $30 left, so he can only spend $30 on plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he buys is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of action figures:**
   Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, he has:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
   - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $0.30/sandwich = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. We can do this by comparing the actual temperature to the set temperature.

The set temperature is 450 degrees, and the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% off.

Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( x \). The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is \(12 + 40 = 52\).

The total number of dishes brought by both is \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils (cups + dishes) brought by the two is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair is two contacts, the cost per pair is:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the hours each person worked:

- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so in total, Jill worked \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours on Sunday.
- Therefore, John worked a total of \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours.

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person:

- Jill's earnings: \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30\).
- John's earnings: \(7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70\).

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between John and Jill:

- The difference is \( \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \).

So, John earned \$40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speeds, we first need to determine the third speed after the second increase.

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons, typing speed: 52 WPM
3. After another increase, typing speed: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we sum these three speeds and divide by 3:

\[

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:
- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: The protein content per gram of mushrooms is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \).

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. So, the daily protein intake is \( 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \).

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, \( 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, it's:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And the angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this new weight:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed of the plane = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Using the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

We substitute the known values:
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates they made together:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   - He spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   - He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars on Wednesday.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Adding up all the spending: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

5. **Initial Amount:**
   - Howard originally had $100.

6. **Money Left:**
   - Subtracting the total spending from the initial amount: \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the earnings into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings for the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings for the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 20 \text{ cents per washing} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

Therefore, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts. So, the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the outfit is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a typo and he can only buy one item, we'll calculate the remaining money for the shirt.

The remaining money after buying the shirt would be:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

So, if Joe buys the shirt, he will have:
\[ \boxed{32.50} \]

If the question intended for Joe to buy the shorts, he would not have enough money, as the total cost exceeds his budget."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:
$65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month's cost.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - The cost for the 8th month is \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\).
   - The cost for the 9th month is \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\).
   - The cost for the 10th month is \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\).

Now, we sum up the costs for the remaining 5 months:
\[150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125\]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months:
\[100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the number of days in March and the average number of posts per member per day.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

So, the total number of posts per member in March is:
3 posts/day * 31 days = 93 posts/member

Since there are 1000 members in the group, the total number of posts for the group in March is:
93 posts/member * 1000 members = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat in the bull is 750kg.

Next, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats gives us the number of remaining seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per hour.

1. First, convert kb per second to Mb per second:
   - 1 Mb = 1000 kb
   - Ashley's speed is 20 kb/s
   - So, in Mb/s, her speed is \( \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \) Mb/s

2. Next, convert Mb per second to Mb per hour:
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.
   - Therefore, her speed in Mb per hour is \( 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \) Mb/h

"To calculate the total number of cars towed in the week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total for these three days is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.
2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day. So, the total for these four days is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.
3. Adding the totals from both parts of the week, we get \(30 + 24 = 54\) cars.

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made \(\boxed{17500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of a gold jewel = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600\)

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:

Price of a silver jewel = \(1600 - 400 = 1200\)

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = \(2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\)

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fish Darren caught.
2. Use the number of fish Darren caught to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so we calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:
\[ \text{Number of fish Darren caught} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:
\[ \text{Number of fish Tommy caught} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught \(\boxed{14}\) fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would keep the cost per class at or below $10.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes = $60
- Cost per class limit = $10
- Total number of classes = 10

First, we calculate the maximum total cost allowed if the cost per class is $10:
\[ \text{Maximum total cost} = \text{Cost per class} \times \text{Total number of classes} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \]

Since the actual total cost is $60, which is less than the maximum allowed total cost of $100, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes attended:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be at or below $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes in a week and then sum these numbers.

First, let's find out how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each of them. Since there are 7 days in a week:

- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers per week.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers per week.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for the two of them:

\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. 

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if Reggie ran 20 miles, Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \(T\) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (\$20000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + \$1000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21000 + \$10500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much flour is in one bag.
2. Multiply that amount by three to find the total amount of flour in three bags.

First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, each of 2 kilograms. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since one bag contains 16 kilograms, three bags will contain:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kg/bag} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we first calculate the distance each person biked individually and then sum these distances.

For Alisa:
- Speed = 12 miles per hour
- Time = 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley:
- Speed = 10 miles per hour
- Time = 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to get the total miles biked:
- Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add these times together.

1. **Time to dig through soil:**
   - Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

2. **Time to dig through clay:**
   - Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so his speed through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
   - He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time:**

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is $2100."
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the costs for the 3 hours:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105."

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: Twice the hanger rental cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental Cost} + \text{Fuel Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:
\[ \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \text{Initial Cost} + \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R):** 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P):** It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, \( P = R + 20 \). Substituting the value of R, we get \( P = 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans (B):** Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \). Substituting the values of P and R, we get \( B = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference = Cost of first mixture - Cost of second mixture = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."

- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the total number of legs and heads:
1. The total number of heads is 20, so \( S + G = 20 \).
2. The total number of legs is 70, so \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day). Therefore, the cost of the coffee for a week is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut together, we get:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00. So, the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

This means there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add up the total amount of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they share the money equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of employees who are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they share equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to divide this total equally among the three of them:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, if they share the candy equally, each of them would have:

\[ \boxed{4 \text{ pounds}} \]"
"To find out how much change Adam got, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is:
7 candies * $0.5/candy = $3.5

The cost of 10 candies of type B is:
10 candies * $0.75/candy = $7.5

The total cost of the candies is:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
$15 - $11 = $4

Therefore, the change Adam got is $4."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. Since her first 8 days were good, her next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = Neutral days
30 - (12 + 8) = 10 neutral days

Now, we know that the last 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, we add these to the initial count of good days:

Initial good days + Good days in the last 3 days = Total good days
12 + 2 = 14 good days

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height, given its daily growth rate.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Daily growth rate = 30 inches/day
- Number of days required = Height increase needed / Daily growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now he needs toys for 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. After buying the toys for 12 dogs, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs.
4. So, now he needs toys for 12 + 16 = 28 dogs.
5. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he needs toys for 28 - 3 = 25 dogs.

The total number of toys James needs is 25."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total initial investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. Frances invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]

5. After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Subtract the current total from their goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.
Total signatures = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Step 2: Subtract the current total from their goal.
Their goal is 100 signatures.
Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the group will exceed this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they bake \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the other triplet is also \( x \) years old, and the other twin is \( x + 7 \) years old.

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, the younger triplet is 7.5 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework.

John's homework times are:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time John will spend on his homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Now, we know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Adding the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies together, we get:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we can calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.

Calculating \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.60x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.40x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate, so the cost of bananas in a crate is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate, so the cost of apples in a crate is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate, so the cost of oranges in a crate is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs currently available and then compare it to the number of chairs required for the function.

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - There are 8 high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   - The total number of chairs is the sum of regular chairs and high chairs.
   - Total chairs = 40 (regular) + 8 (high) = 48 chairs.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
   - Total chairs needed = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57 chairs.

4. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs available
   - Additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9 chairs.

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

There are 5 8 point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend."
"There are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, the number of pairs in the box is 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will see 40% of these fireworks:

- Hannah's view = 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 fireworks (city) + 15 fireworks (her own) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can represent Gary's truck capacity as \( x \). Therefore, the equation for the combined capacity is:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - Number of females = 6
   - Number of males = 8 (including Larry)

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males
   - Total dumplings = 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, let's determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. So, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 \text{ (initial hours)} + 6 \text{ (additional hours)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:
9"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes."
"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is \(14 \times 12 = 168\).

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to calculate how much of each type of ice cream is made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the two amounts together gives the total production in 48 hours:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works with these 4 scoops. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, with 4 scoops, she can get 2 scoops free (since 4 divided by 2 is 2).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she will get is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream."
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each of them has left after two weeks:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 square feet bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

First, calculate two thirds of the bathroom area:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30 pounds

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30 pounds

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   \[
   6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   \[
   2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories}

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three of them together ate:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two of them together ate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Final answer:

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches, and then use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches:
   - Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches.
   - Therefore, Topher's shoe length in inches is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

2. Use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe:
   - The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
   - Let the length of Bobby's shoe be \( x \) inches.
   - According to the problem, \( 100 = 9x + 10 \).

3. Solve for \( x \):
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \( 100 - 10 = 9x \)
   - Simplify: \( 90 = 9x \)
   - Divide both sides by 9: \( x = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \)

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Determine how many smores can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores, we need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, if Dora is 15, her father's age is:
\[ 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, her mother's age is:
\[ 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
\[ 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each of them got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

Each of them got $5."
"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weight of each book together.

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, and there are 2 of them, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, candidate B received:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total votes for candidates A and B are:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes for candidate C is:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces, and Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces, and Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce, and Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ ounce per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Now, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial 32 ounces:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98."
"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Step 1: The total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is:
10 (baking) + 5 (basketball) = 15 students

Step 2: Subtract the number of students who like to bake or play basketball from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music:
50 (total students) - 15 (baking or basketball) = 35 students

Step 3: We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
2 * 5 = 10 students

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
35 (students who like to play video games or music) - 10 (students who like to play music) = 25 students

Final numerical answer:
25 students like to play video games."
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away 1/3 of them, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds flew away, leaving:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

Step 1: Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.
\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Step 2: In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40.
\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Step 3: To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.
\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

3. Mara then tripled the number of slices on the plate, so now there are \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so now there are \(15 - 2 = 13\) slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so now there are \(13 - 5 = 8\) slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of grooming jobs she has for the week.

- Dogs to be bathed: 8
- Cats to have their nails clipped: 5
- Birds to have their wings trimmed: 3
- Horses to be brushed: 12

Total grooming jobs = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

"To determine the savings, we first need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12/child = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10/child = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks to determine the savings:

"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has. If Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, then Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Cal has:

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has:

\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \text{ marbles} \]

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles each has:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.
   - For two 4-week months, the total is \(1200 \times 2 = 2400\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.
   - For two 4-week months, the total is \(800 \times 2 = 1600\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals:**
   - Adding the weekday and weekend rentals together, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\) chairs.

   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 27 large buttons and 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large buttons and 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons and 27 small stickers from the first trade, making a total of 87 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many that is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x \) with \( \frac{500}{7} \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the number of cases must be a whole number, and the problem context suggests we should round to the nearest whole number, the third house will need 143 cases of shingles.

Final answer:

This means George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."

"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

To find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total sales for vanilla scents:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total sales for fruity scents:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = Vanilla scents sold - Fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he has already made from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ dollars per ear of corn} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

Time left after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for playing soccer is:

Time for soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time for soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to drive to the museum:**

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels that will be left is 276."

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Normal movies**: The remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total cost**: Add up the costs for the series, older movies, and normal movies:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost to replace the movie collection with digital versions is:
\[
\boxed{4400}

Therefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Points from enemies:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10.
   - So, the difference in points from enemies = 8 * 10 = 80 points.

2. **Points from berries:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5.
   - So, the difference in points from berries = 3 * 5 = 15 points.

3. **Points from the timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left on the timer = 30.
   - So, the difference in points from the timer = -4 * 30 = -120 points (negative because Ava is slower).

Now, we add up the differences:
- Difference in points from enemies: +80
- Difference in points from berries: +15
- Difference in points from the timer: -120

Total difference in scores = 80 + 15 - 120 = -25

The difference between their two scores is -25. This means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's score."
"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each.
2. Subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas.
3. Divide the combined cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is \(30 + 30 = 60\) dollars.
2. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Subtracting the cost of the two pizzas from this total gives \(64 - 60 = 4\) dollars for the other two pizzas.
3. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost by 2: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) dollars.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
2 dollars."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which means they ride:

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so:

2 rides/day * 2 days = 4 rides

Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 4 rides = 19 rides

So, they ride their bikes 19 times a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding these to his pond, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \). Therefore, \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also have the equation from the total number of fish bought:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work. Therefore, the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week.

Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). This means for every 10 miles, he uses 1 gallon of fuel.

Fuel used per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel used per week = 50 miles/week / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.

Cost of fuel per week = Fuel used per week * Price per gallon
Cost of fuel per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on fuel for his commute to work."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature was 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The difference in temperature that needs to be raised is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."

"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Hours played in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the second car and the first car after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we first need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials:
   - Diamond cost: $600
   - Gold cost: $300
   - Total cost of materials: $600 + $300 = $900

2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:
   - 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

3. Add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount paid:
   - Final amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   - Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts.
   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

3. Add the tea consumed by all students to the remaining tea:
   - Total tea consumed: \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.
   - Remaining tea: 10 quarts.
   - Initial amount of tea: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

4. Convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons (1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(\frac{48}{4} = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after his second order and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after the second order: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200 candies.
2. Candies sold: 150.

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and by the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional students that joined are:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers that are dropped. She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used by both = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:

- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:

- Initial marshmallows in the bag = 35.
- Marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 18.
- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Marshmallows left in the bag = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows left can be used to make 14 S'mores. These 14 S'mores need to be divided equally between John and DeSean.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Final numerical answer:
7 S'mores each."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's play time: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends' Play Time:**
   - These two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \text{ minutes} / 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \) per quarter.
   - Their combined play time: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **Better Friend's Play Time:**
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \) per quarter.
   - Their play time: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends: 24 quarters
   - Better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total: \( 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 \text{ quarters} \).

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. He initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16, so the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Step 2: Total number of tasks per week
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week.

Step 3: Total earnings
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings per week = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week.

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, which is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is the total monthly production minus the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars of chocolate."
"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum these times for a month with four weeks.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Weekly writing time = 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Monthly writing time = \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Total monthly time = Monthly recording time + Monthly writing time + Monthly makeup time
- Total monthly time = \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60:
- Total monthly time in hours = \(1128 \div 60 = 18.8\) hours.

So, Britany spends a total of 1128 minutes, or 18.8 hours, on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - She needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - She needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, then the speed of the kangaroos can be represented as the distance divided by the time. Let's denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). The total speed of the three kangaroos combined is \(3S\). Since they travel the distance \(D\) in 18 hours, we have:

\[3S \times 18 = D\]

From this, we can solve for \(S\):

\[S = \frac{D}{54}\]

Now, each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:

\[\frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}\]

We need to find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Let's denote the time it takes for the four turtles to travel the distance \(D\) as \(T\). The total speed of the four turtles combined is \(4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}\). Since the distance \(D\) is covered in time \(T\), we have:

\[\frac{D}{27} \times T = D\]

Solving for \(T\):

\[T = 27\]

So, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total number of dishes = \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\)

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gives her $80, so the total from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
4. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to subtract the amount she still needs from the total amount she has, including her savings in the purse.

The total amount Erika has, including her purse, is the cost of the laptop minus the amount she still needs: $400 - $50 = $350.

Since we know she has $230 from her job and her mom, the amount in her purse is: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \). Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). The unused length of the second glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \). The unused length of the third glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Adding these unused lengths together, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to:

4 * $20 = $80

The hat cost $70, so the change Thea received is:

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea got $10 in change."
"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to $40.

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so that's \(6 \times 2 = $12\).

He spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so that's \(3 \times 3 = $9\).

The total amount spent is \(12 + 9 = $21\).

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount, we get \(40 - 21 = $19\).

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding both totals together:
- Total number of socks and dishes = \( 90 + 90 = 180 \)

Final numerical answer:
180"
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are not good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
20 (total students) - 13 (neither math only nor English only) = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (both math only and both math and English):
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes to perform and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for performances is:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the available performance time by the time each group needs:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to understand the interest rate and how it applies to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, the interest rate per year is:

\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical for simple interest calculations, as it would imply an unrealistic scenario. Typically, interest rates are expressed as a decimal (e.g., 225% = 2.25). Assuming this is a simple interest scenario, we will proceed with the given rate.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 2.25 (225% as a decimal)
- Time (T) = 3 years

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - Half of the 40 white shirts have collars.
   - So, \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the remaining white shirts have no collars.
   - So, \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts have no collars.

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts have no buttons.
   - So, \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts have no buttons.

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.
   - So, \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30
Number of trays = 30

Now, if he sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
Total earnings = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

70 goats"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate one-half of the rooms.
\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms.
\[ \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times this many homes, which is:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ homes} \]

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes} \]

In the third year, they will double the amount of homes built in the first two years, which is:
\[ 48 \times 2 = 96 \text{ homes} \]

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \text{ homes} \]

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \) or \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation, we get:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Adding 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Dividing by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find the age of you (A):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine the number of packs required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1 = 10 * 6 = 60.
- Total infected after Day 1 = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2 = 70 * 6 = 420.
- Total infected after Day 2 = 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490.

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3 = 490 * 6 = 2940.
- Total infected after Day 3 = 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

"Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she bakes:

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos = 600.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520.
- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 23 \]

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."

2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substituting \( A \) into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substituting \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the 5 pounds of potatoes. So, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required.**

Each three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups.
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes needed.**

Each three-ounce box of jello is on sale for $1.25.
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\$15.00\) on jello."
"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.

The cost of one phone is $700, so the total cost for 5 phones is:
\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine the total cost each person pays per month and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly cost.

1. Calculate the total monthly cost for Keenan:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Therefore, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost.
   - Total monthly cost = $400
   - Keenan's share = 40% of $400 = 0.40 * $400 = $160

2. Calculate Keenan's weekly cost:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Keenan's weekly cost = Keenan's monthly cost / 4 = $160 / 4 = $40

Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[

   24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"To find out how much David will spend, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   - $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Therefore, the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate for dog walking.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. So, her hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:
\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = \$11 \times 12 = \$132 \]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\$132\) after 12 hours."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles, so he then has:

\[52 + 28 = 80\]

After receiving the additional marbles, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\]

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the lost marbles from the total he had after receiving the additional ones:

\[80 - 20 = 60\]

Paul has 60 marbles left."

Amy scores a total of 41 points."
"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the cost price of the chickens he took to the market is:
\[ \text{Cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by the boys.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses each boy sold:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by Micah.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5.

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is given as $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the services:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters.

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of new rope} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Sarah will have \(\$10\) left over after she buys the new rope."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:
\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age as \( x \).

Her age in \( x \) years will be \( 8 + x \). According to the problem, this age will be three times her current age, which is 8. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes."

"The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which means they make \(125 \times 2 = 250\) chimichangas on Fridays.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to determine how many microphones are left without a pair.

Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find a space to fit in. This means that the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals from the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals from the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob and then use that to find the speed of the whirligig.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.

From this, we can find the speed of the thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
3. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing session. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \).
5. The total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is \( 6 \times 3J + 6 \times 5J = 18J + 30J = 48J \).
6. The total earnings from mowing lawns and lemonade sales last month is $80. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   6J + 48J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   54J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
7. To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to determine the value of \( J \). Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54J \), we can isolate the lemonade sales:
   \[
   \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80 - 54J
   \]
8. To find \( J \), we need to consider that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6 (since each mowing session pays $6). The only value of \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a multiple of 6 and fits within the $80 total is \( J = 1 \) (since \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \), and \( 80 - 54 = 26 \)).

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children (since 4 - 2 = 2).

Calvin has 2 children, and each child's bowl is 1/4 the size of an adult's bowl (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls). Therefore, the 2 adult bowls worth of soup can be converted to child bowls as follows:

2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls per adult bowl = 4 child bowls

Now, we know that Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup and there are 2 children. If each child eats one bowl, they will each have 2 bowls of soup (since 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child).

Therefore, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, since there are 9 movies and Deepa has seen each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:

"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, the number of red shoe boxes he uses is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10 \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. After losing 2 books, Joseph currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 
1/5 of 30 is \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \) marbles.

So, after giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has \( 30 - 6 = 24 \) marbles left.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.
So, after giving 10 marbles to Donald, Dean has \( 24 - 10 = 14 \) marbles left.

Therefore, the final number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

So, the equation based on the given information is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Then, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

The two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$64.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku:**
   - A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30: \(180 \div 30 = 6\).

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. There are 20 red balloons.
4. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58.

First, calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of bologna pieces for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball. There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of soccer players is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Now, we sum up all the students from the three sports:

\[ 6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices of bread a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together per day:

"Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea. However, since we can't have half a cup in a practical scenario, we should assume the problem is set in a context where fractional cups are acceptable or the problem is framed in a way that allows for fractional answers.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. Next, determine how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in 2 trips:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
   \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip."
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, after 6 days, the tank will have 2000 gallons of water remaining."
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - Movies on Fridays and Saturdays: 5 movies * $10 = $50
   - Movies on other days: 8 movies * $7 = $56
   - Popcorn: 2 tubs * $8 = $16
   - Candy: 4 boxes * $2 = $8
3. **Total spent so far**: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls. The total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins. The total calories for all mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: The total calories for all the pastries are the sum of the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days in a month: 30
     - Total widgets = Widgets per hour × Hours per day × Days in a month
     - Total widgets = 60 × 24 × 30

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days in a month: 30
     - Total widgets = Widgets per hour × Hours per day × Days in a month
     - Total widgets = 45 × 24 × 30

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:**

   - **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Revenue = Total widgets × Price per widget
     - Revenue = (60 × 24 × 30) × 6

   - **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Revenue = Total widgets × Price per widget
     - Revenue = (45 × 24 × 30) × 6

3. **Calculate the difference in revenue:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000

Let's do the calculations:

- **Total widgets produced by Widgeteer 3000:**
  \[
  60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43200
  \]

- **Total widgets produced by WidgetMaster 9000:**
  \[
  45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32400

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs. The total is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs \(\boxed{159}\) pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then deposits $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 5 = 35\).

Now, to find the total number of children, we multiply the number of children per row by the total number of rows:

\[8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children}\]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The parts charge: $60

Now, we add these components together:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$110 \]

James was out \$110 less, or he gained \$110."
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - James swims at half the initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile/hour: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday.
3. Subtract 40 from the result obtained in step 2.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sam had 70 loaves last Friday.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is \(7 \times 70 = 490\).
3. The bakery has 40 less than this amount, so we subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\).

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus’s age:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation. First, let's express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now substitute these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pages per inch**: Since the paper is 100 pages to the inch, and each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, this means that each inch of thickness corresponds to 200 pages (100 pages per side).

2. **Calculate the total number of pages**: Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 300 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Adjusted Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so the adjusted wake-up time is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Asleep:**
   - Kim was asleep from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - The total time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend."
"Given that Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we can calculate his age as:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people as 100% and the number Courtney reported as 120% of the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Courtney, the number of people was 48, which is 120% of the actual number. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, including the two holes they filled in.

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

Adding these up, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]"
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
2. Add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The supplies cost $400, and the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. So, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost:

\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, the total travel cost is:

\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southerly direction and subtract the distance flown in the northerly direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southerly direction and subtract the distance flown in the northerly direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is 30."

- Total time = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones gives us the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 8 * 1/4 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.
5. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the number of boxes sold on each day for both gingerbread and apple pie.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday for each item.

For gingerbread on Sunday:
\[ \text{Gingerbread on Sunday} = \text{Gingerbread on Saturday} + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ boxes} \]

For apple pie on Sunday:
\[ \text{Apple pie on Sunday} = 15 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
\[ \text{Total gingerbread} = \text{Gingerbread on Saturday} + \text{Gingerbread on Sunday} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

**Total apple pie sold:**
\[ \text{Total apple pie} = \text{Apple pie on Saturday} + \text{Apple pie on Sunday} = (10 - 4) + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each item.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
\[ \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = \text{Total gingerbread} \times \text{Price per box} = 25 \times 6 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Earnings from apple pie:**
\[ \text{Earnings from apple pie} = \text{Total apple pie} \times \text{Price per box} = 21 \times 15 = 315 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to get the total earnings for the two days.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from gingerbread} + \text{Earnings from apple pie} = 150 + 315 = 465 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $465 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- The vacation lasts for 8 days.

So, the total amount of sunscreen used is:
\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \( 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \) dollars.
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) dollars.

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24, so his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24, so his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players, cheerleaders, and band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00, so the cost for 3 petunias is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the cost for 2 sweet potato vines is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
- The cost for one basket is $14, so the cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Thus, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is \(3 \div 1 = 3\).

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Cooling effect: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
- Warming effect: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).

The net temperature change is:
\[18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\].

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley as \(D\).
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, which means Bill's age at that time was \(3D\).
3. The time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years, so the difference in age between Bill and his dad when Bill saw the comet the second time is 75 years. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   3D - D = 75
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   2D = 75
   \]
5. Solving for \(D\), we find:
   \[
   D = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5
   \]
   So, Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet the first time.

6. Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was \(3D = 3 \times 37.5 = 112.5\) years old, and the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we can find Bill's age at the first sighting by subtracting 75 years from 112.5:
   \[
   112.5 - 75 = 37.5
   \]

Therefore, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: He writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, he writes:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous's howl is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, let's break down the information given:

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the trousers is $30.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

Given:
- \(A = 3\) (Akbar's age)
- \(B = 4\) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

The average age of the group is:
\[\frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now, substituting \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then contributes $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from everyone else. Since the total collected from everyone else is $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \). The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices, which is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \). Therefore, the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is \( \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \).

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. **Time spent on inpatient rounds:**
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes = 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

5. **Time left to update records:**
   - Total available time = 9 hours.
   - Time spent = 8 hours.
   - Time left = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract this total from the desired completion time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
- Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Next, we know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
- Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8 = 8.

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given:
- Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.
\[ \text{Final population} = \text{Initial population} + \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} \]
\[ \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, the number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, calculate the factors:
\[ (1 - 0.09) = 0.91 \]
\[ (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 \]

Now, raise these to their respective powers:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]

Multiply these together:
\[ 0.624 \times 0.804 \approx 0.501 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ C \times 0.501 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.501} \approx 0.559 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.9%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 20\% \times \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 900 sweets

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept by Anne
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2 = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many sweets are in these 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the original price of $120 for each of the three years.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**
$139"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
2. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums.
3. 3 of the albums were selfies only.
4. 2 of the albums were portraits only.

First, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are evenly distributed among 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Adding the number of selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to determine how long it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, we know that James reads 18 pages. To find the total time he spends reading, we multiply the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early. So, the number of guests after early checkouts is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests opted for a late checkout. So, the number of guests after late checkouts is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in in the afternoon is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, the number of guests after the afternoon checkins is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Dinner Checkins**: 7 more people checked in after dinner. So, the final number of guests is:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday, 6 bananas on Thursday, and triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday on Friday. Triple the number of bananas picked on Wednesday is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas on Friday.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:

\[4 + 6 + 12 = 22\]

John has 22 bananas in total."
"First, let's break down the quiz into its components:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \(60 \times 0.40 = 24\)
- Number of average and difficult questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, the number of average questions is \(36 / 2 = 18\) and the number of difficult questions is also \(18\).

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \(24 \times 0.75 = 18\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)

Adding these up gives the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

\[18 + 9 + 9 = 36\]

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Earnings from large stuffed animals} + \text{Earnings from small stuffed animals} = 120 \]
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find the total for one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."

"The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

The total number of eggs hidden was 100. If 60 eggs were found by the Smith twins, then 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

Out of these 40 eggs, 10 were not found by their friends, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of the package with 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

The final numerical answer is:
$12."
"First, let's calculate the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she approached the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 1.0 = 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, giving an extension, and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension, and having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

The total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

0.24

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to calculate the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates or faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the remaining seats are:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are available for the graduates to distribute to their friends and family. If the tickets are split equally among the 950 graduates, each graduate would receive:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. First, we know that 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized jelly beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
   \[
   3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate her total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate her total parking expenses.
4. Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to get the net earnings.
5. Divide the net earnings by the total number of hours to find the pay per hour.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total hours spent on jury duty: \(6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours}\)
2. Total earnings from the jury duty: \(15 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{dollars}\)
3. Total parking expenses: \(3 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{dollars}\)
4. Net earnings after parking expenses: \(45 \, \text{dollars} - 9 \, \text{dollars} = 36 \, \text{dollars}\)
5. Pay per hour after expenses: \(\frac{36 \, \text{dollars}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour}\)

Therefore, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take Richard to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is 8 * 5 = 40 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds."
"First, we calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of apples he can make by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Amor will have left:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the money left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / Annual income after college = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:
- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):
\[ \text{Average loss} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

So, the average loss per race is $3.5.

Final numerical answer:
3.5"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day into hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. The team worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. To convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day into hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours each painter worked:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, each painter put in \(\boxed{47.25}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. 

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 50 books in total.
2. Half of them are written in English, so \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) books are in English.
3. 10% of the books are written in German, so \( 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \) books are in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first calculate the total distance she has already covered and then subtract that from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers

Distance remaining: 1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is the original cost plus the increase:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds in total each week. 

Since he washes 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to do 2 loads for the twins and 1 load for the king, which totals 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is:

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they watch movies every weekend for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total gives:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats each day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one cat is \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\).

2. Next, calculate the total daily consumption for all 3 cats:
   - Since there are 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

3. Finally, determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption: \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons.
2. Calculate the total cost for the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for the big coupons.
4. Add the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total postage cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of big coupons.
Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the small coupons.
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the big coupons.
Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 4: Add the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total postage cost.
The total postage cost is:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Meatballs in Initial Order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, in the initial order, Sidney had \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. **Mark's Consumption:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

4. **Additional Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

5. **Meatballs in the Remaining Sub Sandwiches:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Final numerical answer:
24"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures.
A quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.
Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so:
\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, he will have 3 pairs of pounds (since 6 pounds can be divided into 3 pairs). Therefore, the cost for each pair is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 pairs * $6.00 per pair = $18.00.

Final cost: $18.00"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining three-quarters of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Maggie as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80. Since she spent a quarter of it, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

Therefore, Maggie has $60 left.

Next, we consider Riza. Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining two-thirds of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Riza as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90. Since she spent one-third of it, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, Riza has $60 left.

Now, we add the remaining money of Maggie and Riza to find the total amount of money they have left:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

So, the two of them have $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Bananas and Days**: Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days).

2. **Bananas per Monkey per Day**:
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

3. **Total Bananas Eaten by All Monkeys in a Day**:
   - The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is \(10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\).

4. **Total Bananas Eaten in a Week**:
   - Since the total number of bananas is enough for a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is \(7 \times (24 + x) = 168 + 7x\).

5. **Equating to the Total Bananas**:
   - We know the total number of bananas is 315, so we set up the equation: \(168 + 7x = 315\).

6. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   - Subtract 168 from both sides: \(7x = 315 - 168\).
   - Simplify: \(7x = 147\).
   - Divide both sides by 7: \(x = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

**Final Answer**: The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, so she had:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and she only has $25, she needs an additional $5. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny needs to give the florist 20 quarters to cover the additional $5 needed for the roses. Therefore, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

\[ 0 \]

Jenny leaves with 0 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total:

$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
= 0.75 * $2000
= $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
= 1.20 * $1500
= $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for, and then find what percentage this difference is of the original price.

Difference in price = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Difference in price / Original price) * 100%
= ($200 / $2000) * 100%
= 0.1 * 100%
= 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, 1 spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If 1 spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. In total, he walks 4 miles (2 miles to the halfway point and 2 miles back home).

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes for him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

The final numerical answer is:
1 hour"
"To determine how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying the same number of bananas individually.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from 10 bunches:
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Therefore, 10 bunches contain \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.50 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

Now, we calculate the earnings:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings:

Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales per hour:**
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced - Hay picked up
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer starts with no bales in the field (assuming the field was empty before starting), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.
   - Number of bales left = 12 bales

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

\[
\boxed{\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}}
\]"
"Let's break down the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is \(6 \times 12 = 72\) inches tall.

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is \(72 + 2 = 74\) inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is \(74 - 5 = 69\) inches tall.

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is \(69 + 3 = 72\) inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 9. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
   After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

3. Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives us the total distance between them:
   \[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:**
   - March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
   - April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 + 19 = 50 days.

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Martha's age based on Mike's age.
2. Use Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

Given that Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Now, since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate Jeff's age as:
\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to ride the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to ride the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on his lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is:
   \[
   30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00
   \]
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \)."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\text{Total retirement savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, and then subtract the coupon amount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The coupon provides a discount of $7.

So, the total cost before the coupon is:
$19 + $26 = $45

After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
$45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of heels:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike. June typically has 30 days.

First, let's calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she would hike in June if she walks 250 miles each day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since her goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June to find out how many more miles per day she must hike:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \]"

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

Now, we sum the total revenue from all the balls:
\[27 + 55 + 75 = 157\]

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a total of 12 kg of apples.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the amount of apples left for James is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left.

**Final Answer: 8**"
"To find out how much each of the books cost, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Anna's initial budget was $16.
2. She has already spent $4.
3. She has $2 left in her budget after buying the books.
4. This means she spent $16 - $4 - $2 = $10 on the books.
5. She bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount of money.

Let's denote the cost of each book as \( x \). Since she bought 2 books, the total cost is \( 2x \).

We know that \( 2x = 10 \).

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year, there were 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there is an increase of 10 students this year. To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks and then use that rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, we find the rate of blinking:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
- The rate of blinking is \( \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \).

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
- If the light blinks 51 times per minute, then to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51.
- \( \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
- 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To calculate the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to determine the time each person spent on their respective chores and then sum these times.

1. Amalia's time to mow the lawn: 4 hours.
2. Megan's time to walk the dog: 2 hours longer than Amalia, so \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior's time to do laundry: more than 4 hours longer than Amalia, so \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (assuming ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the simplest overage is 1 hour).

Now, we add up the times:
\[4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To calculate the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
   - Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

3. **Determine the number of trips in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.

4. **Calculate the total miles driven in a month:**
   - Total miles = Round trip distance × Number of trips
   - Total miles = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives a total of 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Combined, these 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the 4 workers in a 10-hour shift:**
   - Since they produce 20 toys per hour, in 10 hours they produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers and the remaining needed toys:**
   - The order requires 400 toys, and after the 4 workers have worked, 200 toys have been produced.
   - The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order, so the 4 workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The 4 workers produced 380 toys, so the fifth worker must have produced \(400 - 380 - 20 = 0\) toys.

However, this seems incorrect because the fifth worker must have produced some toys. Let's recheck the calculation with the remaining 20 toys needed:

- The 4 workers produced 380 toys, and the order is 400 toys, so the fifth worker must have produced \(400 - 380 = 20\) toys in 10 hours.

5. **Calculate the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker produced 20 toys in 10 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{20}{10} = 2 \) toys per hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{2}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, and Kris kept 9 for herself. So, Kris originally had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means the 16 stickers Luis gave to Kris were the other half of his total. So, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means the 32 stickers Luis had were half of what Seth originally had. So, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can find out how many small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the value of \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[S + 12 + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now, we can find \(C\):
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline together with Camden and Sarah painted 56 eggs:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from these 64 feet:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each of these logs, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice Valerie's salary, which is \(2 \times 5000 = 10000\) dollars per month. 

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is \(5000 + 10000 = 15000\) dollars per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is \(2 \times 15000 = 30000\) dollars per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is \(5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000\) dollars per month.

"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of her walk is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Time on beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week for 8 weeks.
Total saved = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks required to save $28 is:
Number of weeks = $28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

1. For the 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. Since he originally has 36 marbles, if he loses 10, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which is the minimum temperature Donny can drink.

Let's assume the second mug is at the minimum temperature that allows the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

\[14x = 84\]

\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.
3. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.
4. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day.
5. Sum up the total number of sunflowers sold from both sunflowers and bouquets over 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales per day.**

The cost of one sunflower is $2, and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.**

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.**

The cost of one bouquet is $8, and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day.**

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

**Step 5: Sum up the total number of sunflowers sold from both sunflowers and bouquets over 3 days.**

The total number of sunflowers sold from sunflowers over 3 days is:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ sunflowers} \]

The total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets over 3 days is:
\[ 84 \times 3 = 252 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
\[ 39 + 252 = 291 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 291 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many rocks he sells, which is 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren \(\boxed{22}\) days to create all of the picture scenes."

"Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave away 24 roses, so she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then she bought 15 more roses, so she had:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket. Given that the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, and the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning (since 20% * 3 = 60%).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Probability of both winning} = 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

\[ 0.12 \times 100\% = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = \$40 - \$20 = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices on Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \]
- He bought 4 devices on Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times \$20 = \$80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:
\[ \$40 + \$80 = \$120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \$120 \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8
2. **Number of octuplets dressed in purple**: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
3. **Number of octuplets dressed in blue**: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to determine how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows.

4. **Number of blue-wearers wearing bows**: \( 2 \times \frac{1}{1} = 2 \) (since all blue-wearers wear bows)
5. **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: \( 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \)

Now, we need to find the total number of octuplets wearing bows.

6. **Total number of octuplets wearing bows**: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

Finally, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

7. **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: 2
8. **Total number of octuplets wearing bows**: 4

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of octuplets wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

**Final numerical answer:**

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, we add the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 (total) - 4043 (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then he uses:

2 masks/go out * 3 times/day = 6 masks/day

Over 2 days, he would use:

6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined total, so it has \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:
- First complex: 200 apartments
- Second complex: 200 apartments
- Third complex: 640 apartments

Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\] collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\] dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[x - 200 = 150\]
\[x = 150 + 200\]
\[x = 350\]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, and an 8-year-old tree produces 350 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is **1650**."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third relationship:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**

3. **After giving money to their sister, the amounts left with Ronnie and Rissa are:**
   - Ronnie: \(5 - x\)
   - Rissa: \(15 - x\)

4. **According to the problem, after giving money to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money:**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

6. **Now, calculate how much money is left with Ronnie after giving $3 to his sister:**
   \[
   5 - x = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine that 6 pints of the paint are yellow (since 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints).

The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints, and these three colors are in equal amounts, we can divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color.

So, the amount of red paint used is 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. 

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   - Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills = \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills.

3. **Using Half for a Bill**: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 40 bills is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills.
   - The amount used to pay the bill is \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Money**: After paying the bill, he triples the remaining money.
   - Remaining money after paying the bill is \( 1000 - 400 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Tripling this amount gives \( 600 \times 3 = 1800 \) dollars.

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills**: He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   - The number of 5 dollar bills he has is \( \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \) bills.

**Final Answer**: Thomas has 360 five dollar bills."
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the teacher can continue using 20% of the chalk before it becomes too small to use.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length of chalk} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the teacher can continue using 20% of the chalk before it becomes too small to use.**

We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to be reduced to less than 2 inches. Let's denote the length of the chalk after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). The length of the chalk after each day can be described by the recurrence relation:
\[ L_{n+1} = L_n - 0.20 \times L_n = 0.80 \times L_n \]

Starting with \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches, we can calculate the length of the chalk after each day until it is less than 2 inches.

- After 1 day: \( L_1 = 0.80 \times 2.75 = 2.20 \) inches
- After 2 days: \( L_2 = 0.80 \times 2.20 = 1.76 \) inches
- After 3 days: \( L_3 = 0.80 \times 1.76 = 1.408 \) inches
- After 4 days: \( L_4 = 0.80 \times 1.408 = 1.1264 \) inches

After 4 days, the length of the chalk is 1.1264 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 4 days.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls on varsity and then subtract these from the total number of boys and girls.

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity:
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\).

3. Calculate the total number of students on varsity:
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = \(4 + 3 = 7\).

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, let's isolate \( C \) by moving all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old."
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese pizza slices. So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by her friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices. So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by her friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Digimon had its 20th anniversary. This means that 20 years have passed since its first appearance.
2. We are told that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
3. We are also given that John is currently 28 years old.

Let's denote Jim's age when Digimon came out as \( J \) and John's age as \( 2J \) (since John was twice as old as Jim).

Since 20 years have passed, we can express their current ages as:
- Jim's current age: \( J + 20 \)
- John's current age: \( 2J + 20 \)

We know John's current age is 28, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J + 20 = 28 \]

Now, we solve for \( J \):
\[ 2J + 20 = 28 \]
\[ 2J = 28 - 20 \]
\[ 2J = 8 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age at that time:
\[ J + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

Final answer: Jim is 24 years old."

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left from the new pack, plus any remaining from the previous stock (which we don't know yet).

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they used up all 12 bandages from the new pack and were short by 16 bandages. So, they must have had 16 bandages left from the previous stock at the start of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 + 50 = 100\) bandages to their stock.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages they started with on the first day.

- At the end of the second day, they had 16 bandages left from the previous stock.
- On the third day, they added 100 bandages and used 25, so the equation for the end of the third day is:
  \[
  16 + 100 - 25 = 78
  \]
  This confirms the information given.

- To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to account for the 16 bandages they had left at the start of the second day. Since they used 38 bandages on the first day and had 16 left, they must have started with:
  \[
  38 + 16 = 54
  \]

So, they started with 54 bandages on the first day.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means 2 inches of hair were cut off.

So, the cost of the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Adding the cost of the color and the haircut together:
\[ \$40 + \$60 = \$100 \]

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional amount for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional amount for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum up all the amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Alain has \(\boxed{75}\) pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees. He also planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:

- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

140"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. First, calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

2. Next, calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   - Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44.

3. Then, calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   - Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

4. Finally, add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the total:
   - Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses 3 colors. Therefore, \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

The final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 19."
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height, so:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height, so:
\[ \text{First floor height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the first floor height from the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells. This leaves:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells for the other two teams to find.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. This leaves:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

shells for team Gogetters.

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, we know the total number of dogs is 4, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by mortgaging his home. The loan is worth 40% of the house's value, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed from the air, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting**: The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. For 3 days, the total amount of water removed is:
   \[
   1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}
   \]

2. **Medium setting**: The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day. For 3 days, the total amount of water removed is:
   \[
   2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}
   \]

3. **High setting**: The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day. For 5 days, the total amount of water removed is:
   \[
   4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts of water removed at each setting:
\[
3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons per pack.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon:
   - Balloons left = 12.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left = 300 - 12 = 288.

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the amount of the second medicine. Since it is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

2. Next, we add the amounts of both medicines to find the total amount of medicine for one dose:
   \[
   14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. Finally, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
   \[
   56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know the capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
2. Since there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.
4. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also \(5\) diapers per day.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare the estimated number of red jelly beans with the true number to find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare the estimated number of red jelly beans with the true number to find the difference.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and Tim's estimate is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 jelly beans."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became \(20 + 40 = 60\).
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people entered the bus. Now, the number of people on the bus is \(60 + 30 = 90\).
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:

\[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3

So, the new cost of one visit is $2 (original cost) + $3 (increase) = $5.

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For 5 years, the cost per visit is $2, so the total cost for one year is:
3 visits/year * $2/visit = $6/year

For 5 years, the total cost is:
5 years * $6/year = $30

After 5 years, the cost per visit increased to $5. For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5, so the total cost for one year is:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 3 years, the total cost is:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Adding the costs for the 5 years and the 3 years gives us the total amount Pauline spent:
$30 (first 5 years) + $45 (next 3 years) = $75

Final numerical answer:
$75"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{225 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

1. The cost of the wooden tables:
   - John made 4 wooden tables.
   - Each table costs $20.
   - So, the total cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

2. The cost of the roof frames:
   - John made 2 roof frames.
   - Each roof frame costs $10.
   - So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

3. Adding the costs together:
   - Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of roof frames
   - Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"First, we calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each is 35 inches wide, the total width is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts together to get the total cost of the call.
- Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. 

The expected rain on Tuesday is 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's rain. 

Twice Monday's rain is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches. 

Adding 1 more inch to this gives \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

Therefore, the expected rain on Tuesday is 5 inches.

5 inches"
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers (10 nails on each hand, so 20 nails in total).
3. Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure:
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure = 20% of $35 = 0.20 * $35 = $7
Discounted price for manicure = $35 - $7 = $28

Discount for pedicure = 20% of $40 = 0.20 * $40 = $8
Discounted price for pedicure = $40 - $8 = $32

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure:
Total discounted price for both = $28 + $32 = $60

Next, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers:
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails in total (10 on each hand).

Total cost for nail art = 20 nails * $3 per nail = $60

Finally, let's add the total discounted price for both the manicure and pedicure to the total cost of the nail art:
Total cost = $60 (discounted price for both services) + $60 (nail art) = $120

Therefore, Karen would pay $120 in all."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[3 \times 12 = 36\] issues per year.

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[6\] issues per year.

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[4 \times 6 = 24\] issues per year.

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\] issues per year.

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\[3 + 1 + 1 = 5\]

Final numerical answer:
\[
5

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we get the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December is $72. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:

\[ \$80 - (25\% \times \$80) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both sets of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

630 / 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining 36 apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he gave 9 to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the money Walter received is:

\[ \boxed{81} \]"
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or 3/4) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance he travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance he has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we have:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since the recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother made 4 pies, we have:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes used for the juice and the pies:

\[ 30 + 48 = 78 \text{ grapes} \]

Since these 78 grapes were the only ones used, the total number of grapes at the beginning must be equal to the number of grapes used. Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"To calculate how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs first:

1. **Pasta cost per week**: $1.00
2. **Cheddar cheese cost per week**: $3.00
3. **Gruyere cheese cost per week**: Twice the cheddar cheese cost, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
- Total weekly cost = Pasta cost + Cheddar cheese cost + Gruyere cheese cost
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- Annual cost = Total weekly cost * 52
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost is $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of these hats are red, so:

Red hats = 100 / 2 = 50 hats

This leaves 50 hats that are not red. Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue:

Blue hats = (3/5) * 50 = 30 hats

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total:

White hats = Total hats - Red hats - Blue hats
White hats = 100 - 50 - 30
White hats = 20

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"To find the cost per stick of jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discounted price of the bag.
2. Calculate the total cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick to cents.

First, the original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per stick. Since there are 30 sticks in the bag, we divide the discounted price by 30:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:
\[ 50 \text{ cents} \]

Final answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. Therefore, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included in the total time as per the problem statement)

- Difference in drying time = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering needs of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water needed for these plants = 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total water needed for these plants = 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants needing half a cup = 4
   - Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   - Therefore, plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water needed for these plants = 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
- Total water needed = 2 cups (for half a cup plants) + 8 cups (for 1 cup plants) + 2 cups (for quarter a cup plants) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, so:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. The total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (day 1) + 70 (day 2) + 140 (day 3) + 240 (days 4 to 7) = 500 people.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for each breed and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Daily consumption for German Shepherds = 5 kg/day/shepherd * 3 shepherds = 15 kg/day.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Daily consumption for Bulldogs = 3 kg/day/bulldog * 2 bulldogs = 6 kg/day.

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kg/day (German Shepherds) + 6 kg/day (Bulldogs) = 21 kg/day.

Now, to find the weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

Final numerical answer:
40 pairs of animal legs"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

1. **Distance traveled west:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Net distance from the house:**
   - Distance traveled west: 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east: 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, let's first determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the hotel cost and the bus travel cost together, we get \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

So, Helen paid a total of **296 dollars** for the hotel and bus travels during her trip."
"Mazie initially has 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means before dropping the marbles, Dallas had \(21 + 4 = 25\) marbles.

Since Mazie gave all her marbles to Dallas and Darla, and Dallas received 25 marbles, the remaining marbles were given to Darla. Therefore, Darla received \(52 - 25 = 27\) marbles.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, luggage, and children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[ 16 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of these packs. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's do the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan and his friends spent on ice cream cones. Since each ice cream cone costs $1.25 and he bought 4 ice cream cones (one for himself and three friends), the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of movie tickets for Ryan and his 3 friends. Since each movie ticket costs $6.50, the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \times 4 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Ryan only has $13 left, he cannot afford to buy 4 movie tickets. We need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with his remaining $13. We do this by dividing the amount of money he has by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and then subtract that from the $40 her parents gave her.

First, let's add up her expenses:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets at $7.50 each): $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, subtract the total spent from the $40 she was given:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday). In 2 weeks, he would be open for \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days. He services 3 cars a day, so in 10 days, he services \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cars. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his total earnings in 2 weeks would be \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's sum up the total number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Final numerical answer:
23"
"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).
4. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

\[24 + x = 29\]

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the tables.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

2. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs.
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

3. Calculate the number of screws left over.
   - James has 40 screws.
   - He needs 32 screws.
   - Therefore, the number of screws left over is \(40 - 32 = 8\).

Final numerical answer:

"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran twice as far as Vanessa, Aaron would have run 2 miles. Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles.

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, the time it took Aaron to run 1 mile is:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile would be:
\[ 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the total time she took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount required:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues step by step.

1. **Number of Reservations per Night**: 6
2. **Number of Meals per Reservation**: 2
3. **Cost per Meal**: $5
4. **Cost of Wine per Reservation**: $5
5. **Number of Operating Days per Week**: 2

First, calculate the total cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\)
- Cost of wine per reservation: \$5
- Total cost per reservation: \(\$10 + \$5 = \$15\)

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations on one operating day:
- Total cost per operating day: \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\)

Now, calculate the total cost for the two operating days in a week:
- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the total amount made in a week is:
\(\$180\)

So, the final numerical answer is:
\(\$180\)"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of the watermelons, including the 25% profit.

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total cost price}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's work} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( K \) in terms of \( C \) from the first equation:
\[ K = 20 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( K \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]
\[ 2C + 80 - 4C = 70 \]
\[ -2C + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2C = 70 - 80 \]
\[ -2C = -10 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens. To find the number of cows, we substitute \( C = 5 \) back into the equation \( K = 20 - C \):
\[ K = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
