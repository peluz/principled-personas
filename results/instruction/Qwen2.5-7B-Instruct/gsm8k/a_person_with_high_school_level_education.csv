"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the total number of eggs used is:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs she has left to sell:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

So, in total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by 1.5 times the original value.

The increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house after repairs is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the original purchase price and the cost of repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, each session he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs in a day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken gets:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of feed required for the entire flock of 20 chickens. Since each chicken needs 9 cups of feed per day, the total feed for 20 chickens is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Now, we know that Wendi has already given her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total amount of feed given so far is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. The price of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's break down the 16 glasses into two categories: the first glass in each pair and the second glass in each pair.

- For the first glass in each pair, the cost is $5.
- For the second glass in each pair, the cost is $3.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, there will be 8 pairs of glasses.

- The cost for the first glass in each of the 8 pairs is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.
- The cost for the second glass in each of the 8 pairs is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost is \(40 + 24 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for the 16 glasses."
"First, let's determine the number of sheep in each city based on the information given.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file at the normal rate of 2 GB/minute.

40% of 200 GB is:
\[ 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB again.

The time to download the entire 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding up all the time:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to download the file is:
\[ 160 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around.

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to calculate the distance John covers on his way back home.

John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time of 4 hours minus the 2 hours in traffic and the 0.5 hours already spent driving, which is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]

He drives the remaining 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance John covers on his way back home is:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"First, let's calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (cost to water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Next, we calculate the net profit each year:

- Net profit per year = Annual Revenue - Annual Costs
- Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to break even. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:

\[ \text{Total Net Profit} = n \times \text{Net Profit per Year} \]

We set this equal to the initial cost to find \( n \):

\[ n \times 7.5 = 90 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the contemporary dance students:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate this as:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. We find the number of hip-hop dance students by subtracting the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, and the profit would be $125.

**Final Answer:**
$125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction.

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Now, we add the distances for each day:

- **Total distance for the first day:** 80 miles
- **Total distance for the second day:** 150 miles

Adding these together gives the total distance covered by each train over the two days:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

**Final numerical answer:**
230 miles"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that the total distance is 12 miles and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can solve for the total time:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles) walking the first 6 miles. Therefore, she has:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \]
left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

The remaining distance is 6 miles, and the time left is 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate the water content as follows:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The remaining water in the orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate the water content as follows:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the remaining water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Determine the age difference between Raymond and his son:**
   - Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and he was born 6 years before Samantha, we need to find out how old Raymond was when Samantha was 25.
   - When Samantha was 25, Raymond was \(25 - 6 = 19\) years old.
   - Therefore, Raymond was 23 - 19 = 4 years older than his son when he had him.

4. **Calculate the year Raymond's son was born:**
   - If Samantha is currently 31, and Raymond was 19 when Samantha was 25, then Raymond was 19 + 6 = 25 years old when Samantha was 31.
   - Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and he was 25 years old when Samantha was 31, we can determine that Raymond's son was born 2 years before Samantha was 31.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23, which is 2 years before Samantha is now 31.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to his first 3 customers, with each buying 1 DVD. So, that's 3 DVDs.

Then, he sold DVDs to his next 2 customers, with each buying 2 DVDs. So, that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.

His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Adding these up: 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle is burning and then use the rate at which it melts.

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total amount the candle will melt:
   - Total melting = Rate of melting × Total time burning
   - Total melting = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = \( 3 \times 42 = 126 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = \( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 \)

Adding these amounts together:
- \( 49.50 + 67.50 = 117 \)
- \( 117 + 126 = 243 \)

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of \( 243 \) dollars on all the clothing items.

**Final Answer:**
243"
"First, let's determine how many servings Cynthia consumes in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, in 60 days, she will consume:

\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings. Therefore, the number of cartons required is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip.

To find the distance of the second stop from the start, we subtract 15 miles from the total distance:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the cost of the boots be \( B \) dollars.
2. The cost of one pair of high heels is $33.
3. The cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, so it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
4. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   99 = B - 5
   \]
6. To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 99 + 5 = 104
   \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"First, let's calculate the daily care time for all the dogs:

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on the dogs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, Gretchen has 110 coins in total, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

We are also told that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which gives us another equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has 5 more than 20 jewels:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

\[ 4 \text{ points} + 1 \text{ point} = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:

\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the total amount of money he had before buying the video games was:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since John initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he ended up with $165 after buying the video games, it indicates that he did not use all the money from the lego sets. However, the question asks how many lego sets he still has, and since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week.

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Next, we know the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone:**
   - We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   - Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   - Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   - Since Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"First, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

When Polly is not holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw it for:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Final answer:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories remaining.

Next, we need to find out how many calories each serving of chips contains:
250 calories per serving.

Now, we calculate how many servings of chips can be eaten with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can find out how many grams are in one serving:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Finally, we calculate how many grams of chips can be eaten with 0.8 servings:
0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, we divide the total number of candles by 10:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After all the usage, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

We know that after using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \( 163 \).

**Final Answer:**
163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The wire is 4 feet long, so in inches, it is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to find out how long it takes him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. Calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM:
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM).
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. Calculate the time it takes to travel back:
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how many toys, each weighing 1/2 pound, are needed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds. We do this by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's revenue ($480), we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:

$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"First, we need to determine the number of adopted kittens the Doubtfire sisters brought home. They adopted 7 kittens.

Next, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy, the first cat, has had. According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
This means Patchy has had 21 kittens.

The problem also states that Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add up all the kittens:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

Adding these together:
\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

1. The cost of one movie ticket is $7.
2. The cost of popcorn is $7.
3. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this $14 with his $42.

4. We divide the total amount of money Peter has by the cost of one trip to the movies: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to add the raspberries in the clusters to the individual raspberries.

First, calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
- There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries.
- So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is \(6 \times 20 = 120\).

Next, add the individual raspberries:
- There are 67 individual raspberries.

Now, add the raspberries from the clusters and the individual raspberries together:
- Total raspberries = raspberries in clusters + individual raspberries
- Total raspberries = 120 + 67 = 187

So, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, let's add up all the oranges that are not good:
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Total non-good oranges:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and construction for the brooch. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the materials and construction:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two different pension structures: the initial 20 years and the additional 10 years.

1. **Initial 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

2. **After 20 years:**
   - Starting from the 21st year, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

To find the additional pension after 20 years, we calculate 5% of $50,000:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = \$2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension will be the sum of the fixed pension and the additional 5%:
\[ \$50,000 + \$2,500 = \$52,500 \]

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:
\[ \boxed{52500} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is reduced by 10%.
   - The reduced monthly charge: \( 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

1. Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
2. To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:
   \[
   \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
   \]

3. Now, we know that her car can travel 25 miles per gallon. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\[9 \times 4 = 36\]

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - So, for each school, the number of players is \(5 \text{ (girls)} + 5 \text{ (boys)} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - So, for each school, the number of coaches is \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of players and coaches per school by 4.

- Total number of players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
- Total number of coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total number of people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. So, we calculate the number of emeralds as:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

\[ \boxed{595} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students ÷ Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Bailey started with \(\boxed{60}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, she teaches \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we need to add the number of instructions from both recipes.

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.
2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

Now, we add the instructions from both recipes:
\[20 + 40 = 60\]

So, Kelian has to read a total of 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times \$3 \text{ per brownie} = \$129 \]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4 \text{ per slice} = \$92 \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \$221 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 10\% \times \$150 = 0.10 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the original cost plus the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since this amount is to be paid in 3 monthly installments, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36.
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18.
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34.

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **4th level (top level):** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **2nd level:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **1st level (bottom level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ 7.5 \]"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 180 days and then determine how many bags that amount corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food for the first 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - For 180 days, the puppy will eat \(1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}\).

2. **Determine how many bags of dog food are needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - To find out how many bags are needed for 180 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag: \( \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags}\).

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final Answer:**
Cecilia will use 2 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**

"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
- Each package contains 3 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
- Each package contains 2 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost with packages of 3: $15
- Cost with packages of 2: $9

The difference in cost is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."

"First, let's calculate how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we know a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed so far is:

\[ \text{Total water distributed} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, 4 times Grace's weight is:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, subtract 2 pounds to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add Grace's and Alex's weights to find their combined weight:

\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times the alarm rang each time it went off and then sum these values.

1. **First time the alarm went off:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second time the alarm went off:**
   - It rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) times.

3. **Third time the alarm went off:**
   - It rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) times.

\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Annual Salary for the First 5 Years**: Since the salary is paid monthly, we first calculate her annual salary for the first 5 years.
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = 600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10%. The new salary after the increase is:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 7200 + (0.10 \times 7200) = 7200 + 720 = 7920 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

4. **Salary Increase for Each Subsequent Year**: The salary increases by 10% each year. We need to calculate the salary for the next three years.

   - **Year 6**: 
     \[
     \text{Salary} = 7920 + (0.10 \times 7920) = 7920 + 792 = 8712 \text{ dollars per year}

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{10541.52}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends. To find out how many will show up, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina needs. She plans to give 0.75 gift bags per guest. So, for 12 guests, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults. Since each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad and there are 20 adults, we multiply 10 lbs by 20:

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children. Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is:

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children:

\[ 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information given.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we add up the total number of pets:
\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28\]

So, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To find out how old Jackson is, let's use the information given to set up equations and solve for Jackson's age.

1. Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
   - Amy's age = A
   - Jackson's age = J
   - Corey's age = C
   - James's age = 10

2. From the information given:
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
   - James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey: \( C = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. Now, we know Corey's age is 11. Using this, we can find Amy's age:
   - \( A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \)

4. Now that we know Amy's age is 9, we can find Jackson's age:
   - \( A = J + 5 \)
   - \( 9 = J + 5 \)
   - Solving for J: \( J = 9 - 5 = 4 \)

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10%. Therefore, his new time is 90% of his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

348"
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

This means the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. Therefore, the number of cans used is \(64 \div 16 = 4\) cans.

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes used is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) tomatoes.

**Final Answer**: Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we need to find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving away 40 plants. She originally had 80 plants and will give away 40 plants, so the number of plants she will have left is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will also receive 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the 40 plants she has left, the total number of potted plants she will have is:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these numbers.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day for the next 4 days.

6 pages per day"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday to Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given about the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

140"
"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies.

"First, let's calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

- Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since he watched 7 hours in total, the hours watched on Wednesday are:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[3\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"First, calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon:

Next, calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtract the cashback from the total cost to find the final amount:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

The final amount after the cashback rewards is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate.
2. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate.
3. Add the totals from both to get the combined total.
4. Divide the combined total by 2 to find the average.

Let's start with Beatrice:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, Marcell:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds and she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson involves cleaning the whiteboard 3 times.
3. There are 4 teachers.

First, calculate the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned by one teacher in a day:
- Each teacher cleans the whiteboard 2 lessons/day * 3 cleanings/lesson = 6 times/day.

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings for all 4 teachers:
- 4 teachers * 6 cleanings/teacher/day = 24 cleanings/day.

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. Over 15 days, he plants:

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the information step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50x \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 of these boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 of these boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost for all boards: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 of these boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 of these boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

3. **Total selling price:**
   - Total selling price for all boards: \( \$150 + \$120 = \$270 \).

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

1. **Profit:**
   - Total selling price: \$270.
   - Total original cost: \$180.
   - Profit: \( \$270 - \$180 = \$90 \).

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \$90."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to \( \frac{120}{20} = 6 \) teaspoons.

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) teaspoons.

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So, he buys a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pairs of shoes.

So, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.

Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).

Adrien's salary four years ago was 130% of Lylah's salary, so:
\[ 1.30L = 40,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30,769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find Adrien's current salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40% over the four years.

Adrien's current salary is:
\[ 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Since both salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's current salary is also 40% higher than her salary four years ago.

Lylah's current salary is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total: \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits
- Kael's total: \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits

Finally, we add the totals together to find the overall number of fruits:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours

"First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. These 20 letters are now part of the pile of already-stamped letters. Initially, there were some letters already in this pile. After adding the 20 newly stamped letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began was \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).
2. Julia's husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she used 3 spoons from the total.
4. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons left.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \( 10 \).

\[ \text{Number of friends Amy made} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we find the total number of friends both Lily and Amy have together by adding the number of friends each has:

\[ \text{Total number of friends} = \text{Number of friends Lily made} + \text{Number of friends Amy made} \]
\[ \text{Total number of friends} = 50 + 70 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:

"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information.

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons at $45 each:
  \[
  4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- 20 peppers at $15 each:
  \[

"First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we can calculate the total time as follows:

\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[ 12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour for each patient visit. Therefore, the total revenue from patients is:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40000 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the hospital. The hospital pays the doctors $150 an hour. Therefore, the total cost for the hospital is:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40000 - \$30000 = \$10000 \]

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of:

\[ \$10000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them.
2. Subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number to find out how many are left.
3. Subtract the 10 elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining number.

Let's start with the first step:

1. A third of the 60 elves quit:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.

2. Subtract the 20 elves who quit from the initial 60:

Therefore, the final number of elves left is 30."
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure for June.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. So, we subtract $60 from $500 to find his June expenditure:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Now, we add his expenditures for May and June to find the total expenditure for the two months:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ rides} \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred combined:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ rides} \]

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ tickets} \]

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:

"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we know that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. So, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$720 \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Brian has 15 video games right before the comparison.

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, bags of chips, and cookies before any additional fees or tips.

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Adding these amounts together gives the subtotal before the delivery fee and tip:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the subtotal:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal gives the total before the tip:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

So, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[29.00\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Mark completed in each test and then find out how many he left incomplete.

### First Test:
- **Total questions**: 75
- **Rate of completion**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time available**: 8 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions he left incomplete:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

### Second Test:
- **Total questions**: 100
- **Rate of completion**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time available**: 6 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions he left incomplete:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

### Total Incomplete Questions:
To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{105} \]"

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]
\[ B = 2Q \]

Now substitute these into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we can multiply this by the number of days in a week:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\$140\) in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of supplies for each client. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for each client is:

\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total cost for all clients is:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
John has 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, we divide 12 by 3 to find the number of harvests in a year.
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares.
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. Let's calculate the total number of Lego pieces:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 30 bees = 15 bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 2 times the number that left in the first 6 hours = 2 * 30 bees = 60 bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 12 hours and hadn't already returned. This includes the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours and the 60 bees that left in the next 6 hours, minus the 15 bees that returned in the second 6 hours.
   - Total bees that left in the first 12 hours: 30 + 60 = 90 bees
   - Bees that returned in the second 6 hours: 15 bees
   - Bees returning in the last 6 hours: 90 - 15 = 75 bees

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **75**."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10.
The cost for 1 adult ticket is $12.

So, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} - 22 = 8 \]

To find the amount given, we add $22 to $8:
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can substitute and solve for Dorothy's friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Next, we need to find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:

"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles
- Convert to feet: \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute
- Time to get home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles
- Convert to feet: \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute
- Time to get home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve finishes in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their times is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by for both tires, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by for all their tires, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[500 \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
- Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains 6 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with $10.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of french fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes. He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. So, the total hours for these days are:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes. He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So, the total hours for these days are:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both types of days to find the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks to find the total hours for the semester:

\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

\[ 272 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Next, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. 

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, he can see:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Next, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. So, he can see:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

15"
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday would be:

\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Total for Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Total for Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Now, let's add the totals for both Anakin and Locsin to find the total number of fish they caught together.

Total fish caught = Anakin's total + Locsin's total
Total fish caught = 19 + 13 = 32 fish

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Increase every 2 months**: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

Now, we calculate the price after each 2-month period. The price after each period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the price after each period is the previous price plus 20% of the previous price:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Old Price} \times (1 + 0.20) = \text{Old Price} \times 1.20 \]

Since the price increases 18 times, we can express the final price as:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"

- The total value of the 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

- The total value of the 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

- The total value of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these values together gives the total value of all the toys:

"First, we need to calculate the amount of money Jackie will lose by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant. She will lose $35 for each hour of freelance work she doesn't do, and she will lose 3 hours of work.

The total loss in income is:
\[ 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 105 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to compare this loss to the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the amount she would lose by doing her taxes herself:
\[ 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's sum these amounts:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 + 74 + 102 = 1509 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1509 = -9 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Elvira will be €9 short of her budget. Therefore, she will not have any money left for her clothing. In fact, she will need an additional €9.

Final answer:
\[ \text{Elvira will have } -9 \text{ euros left for her clothing.} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into this equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Adding $2 to that amount gives \(16 + 2 = 18\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays = 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - Total miles walked on weekends = 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Total miles = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends
   - Total miles = 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum up the legs from all the creatures:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of the birds based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together:

\[
8 \text{ (Sally Thirtytwo)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} = 41
\]

The total age of the four birds is 41."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

95 minutes"

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
\[
\text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
\[
\text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. **Bo's crabs**: We are given that Bo has 40 crabs.
2. **Monic's crabs**: Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. **Rani's crabs**: Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total:

\[
40 \text{ (Bo's crabs)} + 36 \text{ (Monic's crabs)} + 46 \text{ (Rani's crabs)} = 122
\]

The total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

\[ 5 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
- Lloyd tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, for the second week, his earnings are:

"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and that this number is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:

\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \]

So, two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = \( 4 \times 55 \) seconds
\[ 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
Total time for the slower team = \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 \) seconds
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer: 25%**"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\).

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - The total straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = \(50 \text{ pieces} + 20 \text{ pieces} = 70 \text{ pieces}\).
   - Straw used for rats = \(160 \text{ pieces} - 70 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

4. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = \(90 \text{ pieces}\).
   - Let the number of rats in each cage be \(x\).
   - Total number of rats = \(3x\).
   - Total straw for rats = \(3x \times 6 = 18x\).
   - We know \(18x = 90\).

5. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   18x = 90

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

The total cost of $102 is to be split evenly among the three friends. So, each friend pays:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, John collects a total of 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock.
2. Divide that amount by 7 to find out the daily requirement.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly requirement.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For 10 ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily requirement.
There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement:
\[ \frac{35 \, \text{pounds/week}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}

Total carrots distributed = Number of restaurants × Carrots per restaurant
Total carrots distributed = 40 × 2
Total carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total distributed carrots from the initial amount to find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used.

Carrots not used = Initial amount - Total distributed
Carrots not used = 200 - 80
Carrots not used = 120 pounds

120 pounds"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092

Now, let's do the math:

23786 - 8417 = 15369
15369 - 9092 = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we sum up all the cards she collected over the three months and add the initial number of cards.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7500 \text{ cents} \]"
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

First, calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day:
\[ 5 \text{ pails (morning)} + 6 \text{ pails (afternoon)} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water in liters:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 every week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the new salary after the 5% raise. A 5% raise on his current salary means his new salary will be:

\[ 104000 + (104000 \times 0.05) = 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year. He will earn his new salary of $109200 plus the one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:

\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount of grapes produced by the farm. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and Josie has 10 acres, the total production of grapes is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many barrels of wine can be made from these grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels of wine produced is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, the farm produces \(\boxed{100}\) barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese consumption for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = \(2 \text{ slices/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days a week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets = \(3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinners:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.
   - Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese = \(8 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}\]

**Final Answer:**
31 slices of cheese."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. Since each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens and she bought 6 bags, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. Since each bag of red pens contains 6 pens and she bought 2 bags, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, and she bought 54 blue pens and 12 red pens. So, the total number of pens is:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the requirement**: Brinley can remove the lowest score from the five tests she has already taken and then average the remaining four scores with the sixth test score to get an average of 93.

2. **Identify the lowest score**: The scores Brinley has are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

3. **Calculate the sum of the remaining scores plus the sixth test score**: If we remove the lowest score (71), we need the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score to be 93. Let's denote the sixth test score as \( x \).

4. **Set up the equation**: The average of the four highest scores (89, 92, 100, and \( x \)) plus the sixth test score should be 93. This can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{89 + 92 + 100 + x}{4} = 93
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   89 + 92 + 100 + x = 93 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   281 + x = 372
   \]
   \[
   x = 372 - 281
   \]
   \[
   x = 91
   \]

So, Brinley needs to score **91** on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first four weeks and the distance he covered in the next three weeks, and then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the next three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to find the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2.

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g.

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g.

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
2. The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Let's calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = \$6000 \]

Now, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than $6000:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = \$6000 - \$1200 = \$4800 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one dozen cups. Since twenty dozen cups cost $4800, we divide $4800 by 20:
\[ \text{Cost of one dozen cups} = \frac{\$4800}{20} = \$240 \]

Finally, to find the cost of one cup, we divide the cost of one dozen cups by 12:
\[ \text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{\$240}{12} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \$20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks the entire perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles. Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we can express the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago as follows:

- The small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago.
- The big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months.

The total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned.

The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

Let's calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna:

- Yuri's points: \( \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \)
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

\[ 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

**Final Answer:**
54"
"To find out how much time Carmen spent on the puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time on crossword puzzles + Time on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}

"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add those costs together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \(180 \text{ dollars}\)."

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

1. Calculate 30% of 120 watermelons:
\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. This means the remaining watermelons were:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

2. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were ready for harvest. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after she harvested these 63 watermelons:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to find the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Next, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, Kylie collected:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells on Monday} \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. According to the problem, Kylie collected 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. So, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ shells on Tuesday} \]

Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bugs.
2. Add the number of bugs to the number of ants.

Given that there are 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

Now, we add the number of bugs to the number of ants to get the total number of insects:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, we need to find out how many penguins jump in the ocean and how many go into the cave.

One-third of the 36 penguins jump in the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third of the 36 penguins go into the cave:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Now, we add the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went into the cave to find out how many penguins are no longer sunbathing:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing from the total number of penguins:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

So, the final number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
12"
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{\text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes eaten by both Steve and his girlfriend per day:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per day} = \text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day} + \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = \text{Total tomatoes per day} \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can determine the number of vines needed by dividing the total number of tomatoes needed per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Ink Collection**: After using these pens, he can collect the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has enough empty pens.

First, let's see how many new pens he can make from the initial 25 pens:
- He uses 25 pens, which means he collects the ink from 25 empty pens.
- With 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.

Now, he has 5 new pens, and he can use these to make more pens:
- He uses these 5 pens, which means he collects the ink from 5 empty pens.
- With 5 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{5}{5} = 1 \) new pen.

Now, he has 1 new pen, and he can use this to make more pens:
- He uses this 1 pen, which means he collects the ink from 1 empty pen.
- With 1 empty pen, he can make \( \frac{1}{5} = 0 \) new pens (since 1 is less than 5).

So, the total number of pens he can make is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 pens from the first round, plus the 1 pen from the second round:
\[ 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so he had:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

"First, let's determine the ages of each girl step by step.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68
\]

The sum of the ages of the three girls is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This leaves:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 280 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[ R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

Final numerical answer:

"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count each book being read once.

- Dolly reads her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book = 3 books.
- Pandora reads her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read a total of 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 6 letters a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24 fries.
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after receiving from Ginger: \(9 + x\) fries.
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Remaining fries with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:** 
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\).

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other, so the difference is:

\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the 5-week period:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since Jean gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

Therefore, Jean paid:

\[ \$27,000 \]"

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96.

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid $32."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Total calories consumed by Sue:
- \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Total calories consumed by Sue's sister:
- \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
   - The number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \(C\). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \(3C\).

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \(C = 15 - 3 = 12\).

Thus, today Rick killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:
- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)
- Cougars: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

Total animals killed: \(46 + 27 = 73\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows initially in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. To find out how many new cows go into each stall, we divide the 40 new cows by the 20 stalls:

\[ 40 \text{ cows} \div 20 \text{ stalls} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and now each stall gets 2 more cows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before termites ate any part of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"First, let's determine how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. Adding these together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pennies in the stack:**
   - The cup contains 9,300 pennies.
   - We need to find two thirds of 9,300 pennies.
   - Calculate two thirds: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300\).

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3}\).
   - Simplify the multiplication: \(2 \times 9,300 = 18,600\).
   - Now, divide by 3: \(\frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200\).

3. **Convert the number of pennies to dollars:**
   - Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100.
   - \(6,200 \div 100 = 62\).

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(\boxed{62}\)."

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, the number of trees in Harry's yard that are more than in Ferdinand's yard is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has \(100 + 25 = 125\) dollars.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has \(125 + 50 = 175\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the amounts of money each girl has to find the total.

Carmen's amount: $100
Samantha's amount: $125
Daisy's amount: $175

Total amount: \(100 + 125 + 175 = 400\)

So, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is $400."
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total fees} - \text{Remaining loan amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm the oil.
   - Time to warm the oil is \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
   - Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
   - Time to cook: 43 minutes
   - Total time: \( 20 + 28 + 43 = 91 \) minutes

The final numerical answer is:
91 minutes"
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ golf balls} \]

Half of these golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has:
300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of bedroom windows is:

\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows in both houses is:

\[ 6 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

\[ 4 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:

\[ 12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the houses is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's add up the total cost of the items the mother bought:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find out how much change she should receive, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches that the body of the sweater takes, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stitches for the rosette. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette by adding the stitches for these parts together:

\[ \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:

\[ \text{Stitches for the two sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve:

\[ \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = \$800 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
\[ \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the rest of the cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:

\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:

\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

To explain this:
- Currently, the sum of their ages is 20.
- In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
- Therefore, the total additional age for both of them will be 10 years + 10 years = 20 years.
- Adding this to their current total age: 20 years + 20 years = 30 years.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35 spots

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park.

Total spots for cobras = 70 spots/cobra * 40 cobras = 2800 spots
Total spots for mambas = 35 spots/mamba * 60 mambas = 2100 spots

Now, we add the total spots for cobras and mambas to get the combined total.

Combined total spots = 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Finally, we find half the number of spots they all have combined.

Half the combined total spots = 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

2450"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people from the team and coaching staff.

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is 12 team members * 2 guests = 24 guests.

Adding the team members, coaches, and guests together, we get 15 + 24 = 39 people in total.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 \) inch = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 \) inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch per bead}} \).
   - This can be simplified to \( 17 \times 4 = 68 \) beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"First, we determine Ann's brother's current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the first five rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the first five rows from the total number of stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars make up these 40 stars. We do this by dividing the remaining stars by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight. Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of medals given out:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so:
\[ 5 \text{ bars/packet} \times 8 \text{ packets} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining bars by the number of children:
\[ 16 \text{ bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Next, we convert the working time into minutes because Susan's earnings are given per 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round. The condition is that they must have over 20 points to get an extra point.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Final numerical answer:
83"
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
3"
"First, let's calculate the number of activities Darren does on the second day.

- Pushups: He does 20 more than on the first day, so \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups.
- Squats: He does 10 fewer than on the first day, so \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats.
- Dumbbell presses: He doubles the number from the first day, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the activities for each day.

**First day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20
Total for the first day: \(100 + 50 + 20 = 170\)

- Dumbbell presses: 40
Total for the second day: \(120 + 40 + 40 = 200\)

Finally, we add the totals from both days to get the overall total:
Total for two days: \(170 + 200 = 370\)

**Final numerical answer:**
370"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members eating rice at each meal, so the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's add these numbers together to find the total number of crates sold during the week:
\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

**Final Answer:**
55 crates"
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Number of Bidders**: There are 3 other people who each bid once.
3. **Bid Increment**: Each bid increases by $50.

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she makes 3 bids herself. Let's calculate each of her bids:

- **First Bid by Carmen**: $200 + $50 = $250
- **Second Bid by Carmen**: $250 + $50 = $300
- **Third Bid by Carmen**: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:

\[
200 + 250 + 300 + 350
\]

Adding these amounts step-by-step:

\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750
\]
\[
750 + 350 = 1100
\]

Thus, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is:

\[
\boxed{1100}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels:

\[ 30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance per week is:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance per year is:

\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is:

\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual bonus is:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the annual bonus to find the total amount John pays for driving in a year:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"First, let's find out how long Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of pages per piece of paper**: Each piece of paper, when folded, provides 4 pages.
2. **Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed**: Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages provided by each piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

**Final Answer:**
8"
"Annika started with $50.

She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides, so she had:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of books sold in the first year
Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since she sold 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of books sold in the second year
We know the total number of books in the collection is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

The number of books sold in the second year can be calculated by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[ 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the earnings for the second year
Each book sells for $20, so the earnings for the second year are:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:

- Watson works 5 days a week.
- His daily earnings are $100.

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Now, let's add the weekly bonus:

- Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.

So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Finally, let's calculate his earnings for the month of April. April typically has 4 weeks.

So, his total earnings for April are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
10 \text{ loaves}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can use the following calculation:

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from both items:

- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

You will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8
   \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000, and he wants to save $2000. So, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

Now, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\(13 \times 7 = 91\)

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find out how old Trent is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. So, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age to find Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we add 5 to Jane's age to find Trent's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we need to find the population of Chile six years ago. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \(D\).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \(2D\).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \(\frac{1}{2}D\).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[3.5D = 105\]

To find \(D\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:
\[D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30\]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He originally had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

1. According to the ratio, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
2. If 45 electric wires are needed, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles required. The ratio can be written as:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of People:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **People Who Left:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 10 people left.

3. **People Who Stayed:**
   - Total people who stayed = Total people - People who left
   - Total people who stayed = 40 - 10 = 30

4. **Men Who Stayed:**
   - It is given that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Women Who Stayed:**
   - Since 22 men stayed, the remaining people who stayed must be women.
   - Women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Men who stayed
   - Women who stayed = 30 - 22 = 8

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, let's find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine how many pencils are in the boxes that Jam has. We know Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since Jam has three boxes and 24 pencils in total, we can find out how many pencils are in each box by dividing the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, the number of ice cubes needed is:
\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the weakening effect of the ice cubes is:
\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people trade and leave with 7 new records.

First, we determine how many old records were traded for the 7 new records. Since the ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month} \]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplify the expression: \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 6 = 20 \\
   x = 20 - 6 \\
   x = 14

"To fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time needed to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

lollipops.

If Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the $43 purchase to find out how much the customer paid:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs.

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we need to find out how many of the 220 castles are ruins. Since 40 percent of them are ruins, we calculate:

\[ 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ 88 \times 0.50 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."

"First, let's find the total number of paintball guns they have together:

DJ has 8 guns,
Nick has 10 guns,
Richard has 5 guns,
RJ (which I assume is a typo for Richard) has 1 gun.

Adding these together: \(8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24\) guns in total.

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 of them. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar, 8 batches will require:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge. Since one batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar, 1 batch will require:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase:

New price per share = $8 * (1 + 50%) = $8 * 1.50 = $12

Now, let's calculate the total value of the shares after the first year:

Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease:

New price per share = $12 * (1 - 25%) = $12 * 0.75 = $9

Finally, let's calculate the total value of the shares after the second year:

Final value of shares = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. So, Thomas ate:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John ate half the amount Thomas ate. So, John ate:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. Since John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, the difference is:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students, will have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( 60 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of animals is 60.
- The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Now, substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore:
- The total number of legs from the cows is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
- The total number of legs from the chickens is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks away, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls to his initial 3 balls.

So, the total number of balls Josh can juggle by the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Out of these, 2 are caught and 1 is lost.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ balls} \]

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds (given)
2. **Blue Beetle**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. **Red Bird**: 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds.

The total weight of the animals is:
\[ 50 \text{ (pink frog)} + 50 \text{ (blue beetle)} + 50 \text{ (green toad)} + 60 \text{ (yellow snake)} + 30 \text{ (red bird)} = 240 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the container:
\[ 240 \text{ pounds} + 20 \text{ pounds} = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how many meters Tyson would run if he followed his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more than his current 5000 meters.

To find 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Adding this to his current distance:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

If Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days, the total distance he would cover in June is:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To find the total number of legs from the tables, we need to calculate the legs from each type of table and then add them together.

First, we calculate the legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from tractors to silos. The formula to find the percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly cost of food = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

2. **Treats cost $20 per month.**

3. **Medicine costs $100 per month.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Monthly cost of food + Monthly cost of treats + Monthly cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

5. **Calculate the annual cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12 months/year
   - Annual cost = $220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find out how many hours all of Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga Class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking Class on Tuesday**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class. So, it is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Cheese-Tasting Event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
4. **Museum Tour on Thursday**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class. So, it is \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

So, the amount she saved is:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: 6 hours
2. **Swimming**: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. **Watching shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time by \( T \). We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets in total over 5 days from her parents. Since she gets $5 every day, over 5 days she gets:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. So, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, she spends $1 on lollipops each day. Over 5 days, the total amount spent on lollipops is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money she saves each day, we subtract the amount spent on lollipops from the amount she gets each day:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that before buying the gumballs, Billy had:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his remaining money on gumballs, the amount of money he had before buying the gumballs is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

This $16 is the amount of money he had after buying the candy. Let's denote the amount of money he spent on candy as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 10 - x = 16 - 8 = 8 \]
\[ x = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4}{3}} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance of the first two legs is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's find the total distance for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To find out how long the trip took, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Distance: 210 miles (200 miles to the friend's house + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both legs of the trip:
- Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The total time for the trip is 6 hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys:**
   - We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.
   - Out of these, 43 are girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys is \( 96 - 43 = 53 \).

2. **Calculate the number of boys absent on Friday:**
   - We are told that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday.

3. **Calculate the number of boys present on Friday:**
   - The number of boys present is the total number of boys minus the number of boys absent.
   - So, \( 53 - 4 = 49 \).

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is **49**."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to ensure that the total points from all three tests add up to at least 42 points.

First, we add the points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 \text{ points (first test)} + 18 \text{ points (second test)} = 33 \text{ points} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach at least 42 points:
\[ 42 \text{ points (total required)} - 33 \text{ points (current total)} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Erin's current points (24) are after she scored 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames and the etching for all 44 seniors.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Total cost for 44 picture frames: \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of etching:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - Etching cost per frame: \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total etching cost for 44 frames: \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords: \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all the costs:

- Total cost for picture frames and etching: \( 880 + 176 = 1056 \) dollars.
- Total cost for pins: \( 10 \) dollars.
- Total cost for cords: \( 132 \) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1208 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1208} \]"
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, by making his own wallpaper, Ethan saves $80.

To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the market price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 100 \]"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours from each day she practiced.

1. On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of dance practice.
2. On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
3. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's class, which means 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, Hallie had dance practice for 5 hours a week.

5 hours"
"First, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment is faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them produce 1 kg of milk each, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each.

First, calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, calculate the total milk from each group:
- From the first group of 15 sheep, she gets \( 15 \times 1 \, \text{kg} = 15 \, \text{kg} \) of milk.
- From the second group of 15 sheep, she gets \( 15 \times 2 \, \text{kg} = 30 \, \text{kg} \) of milk.

Now, add the milk from both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 \, \text{kg} + 30 \, \text{kg} = 45 \, \text{kg} \).

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, the number of rolls left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 48."
"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue.

Next, we need to find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[ 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday by dividing the total amount of money by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 \, (\text{Monday}) + 12 \, (\text{Tuesday}) + 24 \, (\text{Wednesday}) = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many socks Lindsay has washed. Since 1 pair of socks consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means she has washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks. Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is \(20 + 15 = 35\).

Lindsay started with 50 socks. If she has washed 35 socks, the number of socks she has missed is \(50 - 35 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 15."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies, so the total number of cookies Rachel had was:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Her brother then ate 44 cookies, so the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will have to pay back, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
Here, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% (or 0.10 as a decimal), and the time is 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find out how much she has to pay per month:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much revenue Millie will generate from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, her profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 \text{ (revenue)} - \$18 \text{ (cost)} = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups and sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, her profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18 \text{ (total profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The number of boys is also 26, but we only need the number of girls for the performance since the choir decides to perform with just its female members.

Next, we need to find out how many girls can't make it to the performance because their bus breaks down. Since half of the girls can't make it, we calculate:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the number of girls who can make it:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16

So, the final numerical answer is:

16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Finally, add the cost of the erasers and the pencils to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost: $30 (for the bracelet)
- Dasha's cost: $36

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\$6\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \text{ gifts} \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's find out how many parts the total number of popsicles is divided into. The total parts in the ratio 5:6 is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Next, we need to find out how many popsicles each part represents. Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of one part:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final answer:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount.

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost.

The cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month.

The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:

Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 20\% \]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of spaces. So, we calculate double the number of spaces and then add 20:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she passed out is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards she has:

- Cards she started with: 50
- Cards she passed out: 29
- Cards she received: 17

The net change is \(50 - 29 + 17 = 38\).

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total slices:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the remaining slices:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much more money Mark needs to save.
2. Calculate how many days it will take to save that amount.

First, we calculate the additional amount of money Mark needs:
\[ \text{Amount needed} = \$300 - \$50 = \$250 \]

Next, we determine how many days it will take for Mark to save $250 if he earns $10 per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\$250}{\$10 \text{ per day}} = 25 \text{ days} \]

So, Mark needs to save for \(\boxed{25}\) days."
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * Number of spiders
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90
Number of millipedes = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate it as:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 60 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 48

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total number of bugs = 168

168"
"To find the difference in ages between Alice and Erica, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Beth's age.
2. Determine Alice's age.
3. Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, calculate Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, calculate Alice's age:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Finally, calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"First, we calculate the total amount of milk John drank. Since each glass is 8 ounces and he drank 2 glasses, we multiply 8 ounces by 2:

\[ 8 \, \text{ounces/glass} \times 2 \, \text{glasses} = 16 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed. Given that milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce:

\[ 16 \, \text{ounces} \times 3 \, \text{calories/ounce} = 48 \, \text{calories} \]

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.**

The builder works for 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
\[ \text{Days worked per month} = 6 \, \text{days/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 24 \, \text{days/month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Days worked per year} = 24 \, \text{days/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 288 \, \text{days/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the year.**

The builder gets paid $50 every day.
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 288 \, \text{days/year} \times 50 \, \text{\$/day} = 14400 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we determine how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- Each bag contains 2 cups
- Number of bags needed: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

For milk:
- Each bottle contains 2 cups
- Number of bottles needed: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- Difference: \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4\)

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

**Final Answer: 4**"
"First, let's calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. For 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, let's calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day. This means he uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we find the daily energy savings by subtracting the new daily consumption from the original daily consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Finally, to find the total energy savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
- The two zebras with 17 stripes each contribute \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) stripes.
- The zebra with 36 stripes contributes 36 stripes.
- The zebra with 18 stripes contributes 18 stripes.

So, the total number of stripes is:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 5 zebras in total. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{88}{5} = 17.6 \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[ 17.6 \]"
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is **$50**."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of steps Elliott needs to take in a day: 10,000 steps.
2. Calculate the number of steps he completed by walking to and from school: half of 10,000 steps is 5,000 steps.
3. Add the 1,000 steps he took during his short walk with his friend: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.
4. Subtract the remaining steps he needs to take after his jog: 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, he needs to travel to the airport, which takes 10 minutes. So, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 10 \text{ minutes (travel)} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to leave and he will spend 40 minutes on these activities, the time he will be early is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

1. **Number of employees in May**: 40
2. **Hourly wage**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

The weekly pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 40 employees, the total weekly pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming May has 4 weeks, the total pay for May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

1. **Number of employees at the start of June**: 40
2. **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired**: 
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 30 employees, the total weekly pay for all employees in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming June also has 4 weeks, the total pay for June is:
\[ 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars (May)} + 72000 \text{ dollars (June)} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
$3.00"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the second pack of fireworks costs $800.

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

This is the discounted cost of the first and second packs of fireworks. Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies. We do this by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that will explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that 99% of the candles will not explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of candles that will explode:**
   - Total candles made: 50,000
   - Percentage that will explode: 1%
   - Number of candles that will explode = 50,000 * 1% = 50,000 * 0.01 = 500

2. **Calculate the number of candles that will smell like wet dog:**
   - Total candles made: 50,000
   - Percentage that will smell like wet dog: 5%
   - Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 50,000 * 5% = 50,000 * 0.05 = 2,500

3. **Determine the overlap (candles that both smell like wet dog and explode):**
   - The problem does not provide a specific overlap percentage, but we can assume that the defect that makes candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be the product of the individual probabilities.
   - Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog = 5% = 0.05
   - Probability of a candle exploding = 1% = 0.01
   - Probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding = 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005
   - Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = 50,000 * 0.0005 = 25

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"First, we need to find the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the regular price.

The regular price of each blouse is $20. A 30% discount means the price is reduced by 30% of $20.

To find 30% of $20:
\[ 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. Therefore, the discounted price of each blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price of $14 each.

Total cost = 4 blouses \(\times\) $14 per blouse
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer:**
350"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker size = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker size = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) cubic inches.

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"First, we need to determine the elevation of the comb after it fell. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the comb's elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's determine the original prices of the jeans before the sale. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the original price of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the original price of the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 + 4 = 32 \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity for the day trip:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder.

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders.

- Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders, each attracting 30 birds. So, the total number of birds from the homemade feeders is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
- Lillian has 3 store-bought bird feeders, each attracting 20 birds. So, the total number of birds from the store-bought feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

\[90 + 60 = 150\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cake. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has left after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - The other half (18 guests) were to have 1 hotdog each.

2. **Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - For the 18 guests who were to have 2 hotdogs each: \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - For the 18 guests who were to have 1 hotdog each: \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs prepared: \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

3. **Actual Guests and Consumption:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog, meaning each guest would need 2 hotdogs.

4. **Hotdogs Needed:**
   - For 40 guests, each wanting 2 hotdogs: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs.

5. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - Hotdogs prepared: 54
   - Hotdogs needed: 80
   - Shortage: \(80 - 54 = 26\) hotdogs.

6. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**

**Final Answer:**
26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's find out how many letters are in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:
- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:
Required amount = Total cost - Total money Dora has

"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together.

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, so he needs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the ingredients:
\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's 4-minute drive time. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 9 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne.

9 minutes"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. So, we have:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
Solving for the width, we get:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is \(\boxed{98}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

- Red beads: \(1 \text{ pack} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 20 \text{ beads}\)
- Clear beads: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 40 \text{ beads}\)

Adding these together, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads}\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Using the same calculation method:

- Blue beads: \(3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads}\)
- Red beads: \(4 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 80 \text{ beads}\)

Adding these together, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   The total cooling effect is:
   \[
   3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( x \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so for 8 bails, the cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs. We divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass: \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we need to find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses. We divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

1. **Cost of Super Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost with regular ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda.
   - So, $21 - $2 = $19

4. **Setting up the Equation:**
   - We know the total cost with the regular ticket is $19.
   - Therefore, $15 + \( P \) = $19

5. **Solving for \( P \):**
   - \( P \) = $19 - $15
   - \( P \) = $4

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 \]

To calculate this:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we add up all the cards to find the total number of cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip and add it to the cost of the pizza.

1. First, calculate the tip:
   - The tip is 1/5 of the cost of the pizza.
   - The cost of the pizza is $15.
   - So, the tip = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \) dollars.

2. Now, add the tip to the cost of the pizza:
   - Total amount = Cost of pizza + Tip
   - Total amount = $15 + $3 = $18.

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (assuming there are 100 participants).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 4 + 2 = 98\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\).

So, Finley finished in 96th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

So, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of laundry item for 80 rooms:

- **Sheets**: \(2 \text{ sheets/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 160 \text{ sheets}\)
- **Comforters**: \(1 \text{ comforter/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 80 \text{ comforters}\)
- **Pillow cases**: \(4 \text{ pillow cases/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 320 \text{ pillow cases}\)
- **Towels**: \(8 \text{ towels/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 640 \text{ towels}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of laundry:

\[160 \text{ sheets} + 80 \text{ comforters} + 320 \text{ pillow cases} + 640 \text{ towels} = 1200 \text{ pieces of laundry}\]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he adds 10 shoes to his collection.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has at the end of each day:

- Starting shoes: 200
- After Monday: 200 + 10 = 210
- After Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240
- After Friday: 240 + 60 = 300
- After Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes."

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.

Total pencils at the start = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, we need to find out how many pencils were used and how many were left.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Pencils left after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, we need to find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

Final numerical answer:
80 pencils"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to find the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 12 \, \text{inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 120 \, \text{inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the ""part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""whole"" is the shark's body length (120 inches). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{120 \, \text{inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

1. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts.
2. However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. If we simply add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, we would be double-counting these 3 kids. So, we need to subtract the 3 kids who are allergic to both from the total.

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

Total number of employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

Total number of tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides

Now, add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
Total number of people = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

To find 20% of $1500:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earnings by 3 pm: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the total earnings from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

They need to earn $26 more."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel's player can hold. Since Gabriel's player can hold up to 100 songs and he currently has 20 songs, the number of additional songs he can add is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Now, we calculate how many more songs Luri's player can hold. Since Luri's player can also hold up to 100 songs and she currently has 60 songs, the number of additional songs she can add is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Stetson made a bet that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. Since he ate 24 oranges, the total amount of money he gave up is:

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to calculate 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes. Since her shoes cost $80, we multiply $80 by 3:

\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find out how much less Jillian's handbag costs compared to 3 times the cost of her shoes. The problem states that her handbag costs $20 less than this amount. So, we subtract $20 from $240:

\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, Jillian's handbag costs $220."
"First, let's calculate the total miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles each day for 5 days, so:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. Since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the total hours by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume in a day. Since there are four horses, the total consumption is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats are consumed in five days. The total consumption over five days is:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats. The number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

"First, we need to find out how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we need to determine the total capacity of the trays Jaime has. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and he has 2 trays, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to place on the tray is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, we can find the cost of the family-size pizza by multiplying $8 by 3.

\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts.

Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs would normally cost:
\[ 2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
\[ \$4.00 \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost per razor. Since 2 packs contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack):
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor} \]

Converting this to cents:
\[ \$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid would be the height of the shortest cheerleader since they are at the top. 

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost for morning rides: $84
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests where the two venues cost the same, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \(D\), the number of insects Bodhi found as \(B\), and the number of insects Lily found as \(L\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, we solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 43 - 7\]
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

16"
"First, we need to calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used. Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

To find the total amount of yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma, we add the two amounts together:

\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:

\[
273
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts for Cherrie's friends:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts for her friends is \(10 + 6 = 16\) gifts.

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total:

\(16 + 10 = 26\)

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"First, let's find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet wide} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this gives the length of the couch:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the couch is 18 feet long. 

18"
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.
5. The total amount she paid is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend and each 2 x 4 piece costs $4, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Final numerical answer:
1200"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs Mario's sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can find the number of pairs needed by dividing the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost without the pass and the cost with the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo.

For the farm:
\[ 30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals} \]

For the zoo:
\[ 60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals} \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to work backwards from the information given about Rose's purchases.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can set up the following equations based on the information:

- Let \( O_S \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
- Let \( P_S \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times O_S = 12 \]
\[ 4 \times P_S = 4 \]

We can solve these equations for \( O_S \) and \( P_S \):

1. For onions:
\[ O_S = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

2. For potatoes:
\[ P_S = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
4"
"First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to achieve his goal. Since today is December 31st and his birthday is July 19th, we need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

- From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 days

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

So, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. 

To find out how much he earned in total, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can find the total amount of water by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink \(\boxed{120}\) milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for all the bags is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

"First, let's determine how many quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour.

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:
\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her additional daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 48 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Adding this to her original daily consumption:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} + 48 \, \text{kWh/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 = 10 \text{ days} \]

This means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days. Now, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the same house. Since 5 people working together would be 5 times as fast as one person, the time required would be:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5} = 2 \text{ days} \]

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} \]
\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have by adding up all the sofas and chairs:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"First, we need to find out the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the total amount he paid by the cost of one CD:

$48 / $4 = 12

This means Tom could have bought 12 CDs with the $48 he spent. However, since he already bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

12 - 1 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[24 + 10 + 6 = 40\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so \(48 - 8 = 40\) passengers remain.
- 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers get on.
- After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is \(40 + 40 = 80\).

At the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so \(80 - 21 = 59\) passengers remain.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off at the first stop. So, \(\frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33\). Since the number of passengers must be a whole number, we assume it rounds to 13 (as typically fractional passengers aren't considered in such problems).
- After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is \(59 + 13 = 72\).

Final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop: 
72"
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find out Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the total cost of the 2 monitors:
\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the printer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of one monitor:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is calculated as follows:

\[ 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Each girl brought 300 seashells.

300"
"First, we need to determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can calculate the original number of candies George had by adding the 5 candies he ate to the 3 candies he has left:

\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can find out how many candies Nick had by multiplying the number of candies George originally had by 2:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies. 

Final answer:
16"
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal.

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18 vlogs"
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip amount is $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the question asks how much you ended up paying, and you are paying the entire total amount including the tip, the final amount you paid is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

The following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half to meet his target.

1. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total savings for the month:**
   - Total savings for the month = Total savings in the first half + Total savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Set the total savings equal to Elvis's target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
   - Total cost for apples = \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
   - Total cost for oranges = \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   - Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
   - Total cost for peaches = \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \) dollars.

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = \( 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \) dollars.

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

- Change = \( 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns from 20 tasks. Since Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, we multiply $0.8 by 20:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, Jairus earns $16 from 20 tasks.

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns from 20 tasks. Since Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, we multiply $0.5 by 20:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, Jenny earns $10 from 20 tasks.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 each = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25 each = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12 each = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10 each = $10.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:

Final amount = $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water. 

In cold water, swimming 3 miles would take:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

In warm water, swimming 3 miles would take:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and in cold water is:

- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find Bob's weight. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we can calculate Bob's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of the three friends. The average weight is the total weight of the three friends divided by 3:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the pyramid and how this affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. **Initial Angle**: The angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves 5 degrees straight upward from the pyramid every hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle of the pyramid plus the angle the sun has moved upward:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be 82 degrees."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so he ate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so he ate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.

Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

4. **Total Goals:**
   - To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna.
   - Total goals = \(80 + 60 + 35 = 175\).

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend. 

**Final Answer:**
$21"
"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide $70 by 7:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day.

Next, we calculate how much he spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since there are 4 days from Sunday to Wednesday, the total amount spent during these days is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

This means he has $30 left for the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday).

Now, we need to determine how many wooden action figures he can buy with the $40 he spent from Sunday to Wednesday. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the number of wooden action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, we get the total number of action figures:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up the costs of the spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. **Spaying cost**: $200
2. **Cost of 3 vaccines**: $20 each, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\)
3. **Cost of 4 broken vases**: $12 each, so \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[200 + 60 + 48 = 308\]

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week:

- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks each week, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses he needs to supply:

Roses needed per week - Roses grown per week = 65 - 40 = 25 roses

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we calculate the total number of roses Ford lacks in a month:

Roses lacking per week × Number of weeks in a month = 25 × 4 = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from her initial amount in the account.

First, let's determine the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 2 years, there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the dimensions of the bedroom are 18 feet by 12 feet, the area is:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the new carpet, including the cost of the carpet itself and the padding. The cost per square foot for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Cost per square foot} = \$12 + \$2 = \$14 \]

So, the total cost for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Total cost for carpet and padding} = 216 \times 14 = \$3024 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot for this service, so the total cost for removing the old carpet is:

\[ \text{Total cost for removing old carpet} = 216 \times 4 = \$864 \]

Finally, we need to calculate the cost for installing the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot for installation, so the total cost for installation is:

\[ \text{Total cost for installation} = 216 \times 34 = \$7344 \]

To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we add the costs for the carpet and padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum the total number of birds seen over the week.**
2. **Divide the total by the number of days.**

Let's start with the first step:

- On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day three, he saw 0 birds.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
- On day six, he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7):

\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5. So, \(30 \div 5 = 6\).
4. Next, this value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is calculated by dividing the difference by the set temperature and then multiplying by 100:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

Final answer:
500"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can also convert this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 × 60 minutes = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house value:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

- Total utensils: \(52 + 68 = 120\)

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is. There are 90 pairs in 180 contacts.

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

$40"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

According to the given information, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we can set up a proportion:

- For 200 calories, she needs 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she needs \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} \).

Now, let's calculate the amount of water:
- \( \frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800 \text{ ml} \).

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's identify the three typing speeds Jared has:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

So, we sum the three measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of these people will also invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited through this method is:

\[ 100 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ (each person + their 2 friends)} = 300 \text{ people} \]

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and invites them. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people from this method is:

\[ 10 \text{ friends} + 8 \text{ spouses} = 18 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people from both methods to find the total number of people who will attend the event:

\[ 300 \text{ people} + 18 \text{ people} = 318 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- **Day 0:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

On **Day 3**, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:
\[ 3 \, \text{grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, we need to find out how much protein he gets in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 6 \, \text{grams of protein/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[
   2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[
   4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[
   \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \(2x\), and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"First, we calculate the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%.

The increase in weight is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 50\% = 8 \text{ pounds} \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the new weight is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, Jamaal uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this new weight:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \]"

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. To find the speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

The final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1260 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Howard spends each day.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spends over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- In four hours, he sold \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}\).
- The earnings from these 60 cups are \(60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30\).

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- In two hours, he sold \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}\).
- The earnings from these 20 cups are \(20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12\).

Finally, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = \$30 + \$12 = \$42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine how many years it takes for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"To find the cost per pump, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washings per bottle.
2. Calculate the number of washings per pump.
3. Find the cost per washing.
4. Determine the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that, which is 60 washings.

Next, we need to find out how much each washing costs. The bottle costs $24.00, and it gives 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is:
\[ \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
\[ 0.20 \times 60 = 12 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $25:
\[ 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts originally cost $35. Since there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, the price remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the outfit is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the problem setup, we can still calculate how much he would be short:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks how much money Joe will have left, and he cannot afford the items, the answer would be that he will have:
\[ 0 \]

However, if we strictly follow the problem as given and assume he can only buy one item, let's calculate the leftover money for each item:

1. If he buys the shirt:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

2. If he buys the shorts:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Since the problem does not specify which item he buys, and he cannot afford both, the final answer based on the given information is that he will have:
\[ 0 \]

But if we consider the maximum he can spend without going over, he can only buy the shorts and will have:
\[ 15 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of dozens he wants to make in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Step 1: Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.

Step 2: Since he wants to do this for a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ dozen/week} \]

Step 3: It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants in a week.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 194 \times 150 = 29100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 194 \times 490 = 95060 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 95060 - 29100 = 65960 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the total duration of the research.
2. Determine the cost for the first 5 months.
3. Calculate the cost for the remaining months.
4. Sum up the costs to get the total cost of the research.

**Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the research.**

The initial funding was for 5 months, and the research took 10 times that long:
\[ 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost for the first 5 months.**

The initial funding for the first 5 months was $100,000.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost for the remaining months.**

The remaining months are:
\[ 50 \text{ months} - 5 \text{ months} = 45 \text{ months} \]

Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month. The cost for the first of these months (6th month) is:
\[ 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \]

The cost for the 7th month is:
\[ 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000 \]

The cost for the 8th month is:
\[ 225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500 \]

We can see that the cost forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \(n = 45\), \(a = 150,000\), and \(r = 1.5\):
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.5^{45}\):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467 \]

So,
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,162,261.467 - 1) \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,162,260.467 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 348,678,140.1 \]

**Step 4: Sum up the costs to get the total cost of the research.**

The total cost is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 45 months:
\[ 100,000 + 348,678,140.1 = 348,679,140.1 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the research is:
\[ \boxed{348,679,140.1} \]"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. So, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

"First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince will have to sell from the bull. The bull weighs 750kg.

Next, we need to determine how much meat Prince sells in a day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, the amount of meat he sells in a day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the entire 750kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount of meat he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the parents. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights per intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving gum to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we first need to find out her current age.

1. Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. This means her current age is \(16 - 12 = 4\) years old.
2. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age: \(4 + 4 = 8\).

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we can find the total number of flowers by multiplying the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find this number, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ 200 \text{ flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert Ashley's speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed in the week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - So, the number of cars towed each day in the last four days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the last four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the last four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

The total number of cars towed that week is **54**."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \text{Height needed in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"First, let's calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the cars. Since the company paid 30% of the price of each car, and each car costs $25,000, the cost per car is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for the company is:

\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total revenue is:

\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}
\]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes to close the gap:**
   - Initial distance between Tom and Bob: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = \text{Fish caught by Naomi} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = \text{Fish caught by Darren} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes.

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes. So, the cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, his parents will still sign him up for the classes even if he misses some.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this case would be:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \):
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class would exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is the sum of the customers processed by each of them daily:
\[50 \text{ (Jewel)} + 100 \text{ (Julie)} = 150 \text{ customers/day}\]

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is:
\[150 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week}\]

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[
\boxed{1050}

"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so:
\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, so:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total cost of the truck:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

1. Calculate the raise amount:
\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 1000 \]

2. Calculate the new monthly salary:
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, let's calculate the bonus he receives, which is half a month's salary.

3. Calculate the bonus:
\[ \text{Bonus} = 21000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10500 \]

Now, let's calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus.

4. Calculate the total monthly earnings:
\[ \text{Total monthly earnings} = 21000 + 10500 = 31500 \]

Finally, let's calculate Tim's annual earnings.

5. Calculate the annual earnings:
\[ \text{Annual earnings} = 31500 \times 12 = 378000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\boxed{378000}\) dollars in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
Since he buys 10 dress pants:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of political and weather news articles published by the first website in February.
2. Calculate the total number of business news articles published by the second website in February.
3. Add the two totals together to get the combined total.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of political and weather news articles.**

The first website publishes 20 articles per day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles is:

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.

\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = \frac{\text{Total soil to dig}}{\text{Rate of digging soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.

\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = \frac{\text{Total clay to dig}}{\text{Rate of digging clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to dig soil} + \text{Time to dig clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total earnings in the first month were:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find out the sales in the second month. The problem states that the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings over the two months by adding the earnings from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so the second and third hours each cost $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

This $220 is the amount she received this week, which includes her wage minus any deductions. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is:

\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find the number of whole eggs needed, divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
   - Number of whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Number of dozens needed = \( \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Lori will need **2 dozens** of eggs."
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper.

First, calculate the number of pages she has already written:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline (since the assignment is due in 30 days).

10 days"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the plane. The plane cost $150,000.

Next, we need to calculate the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel. The cost to rent a hanger is $5000 per month. The cost for fuel is twice the cost of the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Now, we add the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel:
$5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the total maintenance cost for the first year:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes (pork) + 30 minutes (rice) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans.
   - Total cooking time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \times 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

So, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.

1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each:
   \[
   2 \times 2.00 = 4.00
   \]

2. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.

3. And a bottle of soda for $1.00.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the apple pie cost:
\[
7.00

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Now, let's calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B:

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the weekly class time is:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's find out how many teachers are history teachers. Since 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

"To determine how many good days Christina had left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so she had 8 good days in the first 8 days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days were added here.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days were added here.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This adds 2 more good days (since the first and third days were good).

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the next 3 days: 2

Total good days = 8 (initial) + 2 (next 3 days) = 10

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 (total good days) - 10 (good days already counted) = 2

So, the number of good days left in the month is 2."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so there are now \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so there are now \(24 - 3 = 21\) dogs.
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - James initially needed 12 toys.
   - Then he needed 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys he needs is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs 80 kg, so the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight (assuming Jack is also an adult):
\[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 61 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 96 \]

Finally, we add up all the cookies to find the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This gives us the equation:
\[ W = T + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have:
\[ 2W + 3T = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( W = T + 7 \) into the combined ages equation:
\[ 2(T + 7) + 3T = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( T \):
\[ 2T + 14 + 3T = 44 \]
\[ 5T + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5T = 30 \]
\[ T = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( T = 6 \) back into the equation \( W = T + 7 \):
\[ W = 6 + 7 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20. Therefore, the cost of 10 candies would be:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} \times 10 = 0.80 \times 10 = 8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so 10 lollipops would cost:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."

\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.

\[ \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.60x \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is **32 dollars**."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the same as the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we know the restaurant currently has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, which totals:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the number of chairs required:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find out how many great-grandbabies will be at the family reunion, we need to follow the family tree step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, which means there are \(3 \times 3 = 9\) grandchildren.

So, the final numerical answer is:
27"
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Retirement contribution} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this.

\[ \text{Car payment} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts for retirement and the car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Money left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pencils are currently in the box. Since the box has space for 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity:

20 - 4 = 16 pencils

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = \(15 \times 20 = 300\) fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = \(3 \times 5 = 15\) fireworks.

Now, let's find out how many fireworks Hannah will see from the city display. Since Hannah's house is at a right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks:

- Fireworks Hannah sees from the city = \(40\% \times 300 = 0.40 \times 300 = 120\) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = \(120 + 15 = 135\).

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of:

"First, let's determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate:

\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that when Gary's truck joins Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We can set up the following equation to find out how much Gary's truck can haul:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \]

Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as \( x \). So the equation becomes:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
4. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

5. The total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of dumplings eaten by males and females, which is \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received based on the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Since the total amount of money is $100, each part of the ratio is:
\[
\frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Gerald's share, which is 3 parts, is:
\[
3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Julia's share, which is 2 parts, is:
\[
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so the amount of money he has left is:
\[
60 - 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
50

"First, let's determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second.

To find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:
\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:
\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:
\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine the percentage of the river's water that is used for non-industrial purposes by the city.

1. The city uses 40% of the river's water.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.

To find the percentage used for industrial purposes, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]
This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

8%"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
Since there are 7 days in a week, in 2 weeks there are:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.
Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ dollars/day} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to get the final answer:
- Total quarts of ice cream = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00 \text{ per 3 scoops}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, for 2 sets, she gets:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

A week has 7 days, so two weeks have \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left, and Amy has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, we need to find out how many square feet Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom. 

To find two thirds of 36 square feet, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, he would need:
\[ 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. James paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds he picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds.

The cost at the store would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]"

"This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, the total number of boxes bought this week is:

3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps when her arms are not raised:
- She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute.
- She taps her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- The total taps per minute for both feet when her arms are not raised is \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.

She dances for 3 minutes with her arms not raised. So, the total taps in these 3 minutes are:
\[550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}\]

Next, let's calculate the taps when her arms are raised:
- She taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute.
- She taps her left foot at 200 taps per minute.
- The total taps per minute for both feet when her arms are raised is \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.

She dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised. So, the total taps in these 2 minutes are:
\[400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}\]

Now, we add the taps from both periods to get the total number of taps:
\[1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}\]

Therefore, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: \(170 - 20 = 150\)

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: \(23 - 13 = 10\)

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- Total chairs left: \(150 + 10 = 160\)

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three people ate a total of:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two people ate a total of:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, we calculate the time for the dog as follows:

\[
\text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of students' cars smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16
\]

Each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:

\[
16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of teachers' cars smashed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24
\]

Each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:

\[
24 \times 2 = 48
\]

Adding the windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars, we get:

\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. The blue spools are the light blue and dark blue ones:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**: 
   - 2/5 of 5000 people voted.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \) people.

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Total people - people who voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people voted.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \) people.

5. **Remaining people who did not vote by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people after midday - people who voted by 16:00 = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

**Final answer**: 1000 people had not voted by 16:00."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum needed.
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of packs needed.
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.

Adding these together, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[
\frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

Since 3 sleeves are needed and there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 38 \]

Next, we need to find out Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We add their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's add up the weights:

- Math books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 math books)
- Science books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 science books)
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

Adding these together:

\[4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 21\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 21 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube:

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Clara's books} = 2 \times \text{Steven's books} \]

Given that Clara has 20 books:

\[ 20 = 2 \times \text{Steven's books} \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \$5 - \$2 = \$3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times \$5 = \$50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times \$3 = \$48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$50 + \$48 = \$98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \$98 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of students who like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. We know the total number of students in the class is 50. We also know that 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated by subtracting the number of students who like the other activities from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of the cards he received. He received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the value of these two cards is:

\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

Additionally, he received 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. The total value of these 30 cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $26 per adult
- Cost for children: $12 per child

Total cost for adults = 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
Total cost for children = 2 children * $12/child = $24

Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $14 per adult
- Cost for children: $10 per child

Total cost for adults = 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
Total cost for children = 2 children * $10/child = $20

Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

To find Cal's marbles, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have to find the combined total:

   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

3. **Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them, so she has 20 large stickers left.
   - She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons: 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to small buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total buttons = \(27 + 60 + 60 = 147\).

By the end, Lorraine has a total of 147 buttons."
"Last week, Joey played:
- 2 matches on Monday
- 1 match on Friday
- Double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, we add up all the shirts needed:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

"First, we calculate the total number of songs in 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply 300 by 20:

\[ 300 \times 20 = 6000 \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. To find the total hours of music in all the playlists, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

\[ 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**
   - We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

2. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Since there are 18 Pomeranians, and they make up two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18
     \]
   - To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total:
     \[
     \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
     \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it. So, we calculate half of $90:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we add the $45 that Ava gave to Jayden to the $70 Jayden already had:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, which costs $200. We subtract the amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{143} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can find the number of pears by calculating 45% of the number of bananas and then adding that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

So, the number of pears George has is 90 more than the number of bananas.

Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290 pears

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears together.

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290 = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits in total."
"First, we need to determine how much money Marissa had left after buying the ball. She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball. So, the remaining amount of money is:

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing the number of books Ezra read by 2:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, to find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:
\[ 600 \]"
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for the hours are:
  \[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75 \]
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5:
  \[ \$75 + \$5 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are:
  \[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$30 \]
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
Total time = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:
- Reading time: 3 hours
Remaining time = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

Now, we need to find out how much time she spends playing video games. She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
- Video game time = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:
- Soccer time = 9 - 3 (video games) = 6 hours

Finally, we calculate the percentage of her weekend time spent playing soccer:
- Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Soccer time / Total time) * 100
- Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."

"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, let's find the total number of wheels needed for all the toys:
- Total wheels needed = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles
- Total wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:

"First, let's break down the problem into parts and solve it step by step.

1. **Determine the hiking speed:**
   - The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half of the driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
   - Distance hiked = Speed × Time = \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the driving time:**
   - The total time spent traveling (driving + hiking) is 6 hours.
   - They spent 1.5 hours hiking.
   - Therefore, the driving time is \( 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 4.5 hours.
   - Distance driven = Speed × Time = \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

**Emma's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E_e \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times E_b \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times E_t \)
- Total score for Emma: \( 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \)

**Ava's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times A_e = 10 \times (E_e + 8) = 10E_e + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times A_b = 5 \times (E_b + 3) = 5E_b + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times A_t = 30 \times (E_t + 4) = 30E_t + 120 \)
- Total score for Ava: \( 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \)

The difference between their scores is:
\[ (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:

"First, let's find out the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost 30 dollars. 

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \times 2 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find out how much the remaining two pizzas cost in total, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that are already accounted for from the total cost.

\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars} \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

Each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides for these 5 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which means they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
So, for the two days, the number of rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, bringing the total number of fish in the pond to \(7 + 17 = 24\).
3. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish became \(3 + x\) and the number of white fish became \(4 + y\), where \(x\) is the number of orange fish he bought and \(y\) is the number of white fish he bought.
4. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   3 + x = 2(4 + y)
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3 + x = 8 + 2y
   \]
   \[
   x - 2y = 5
   \]
6. We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
7. Now we have a system of linear equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   x - 2y = 5 \\
   x + y = 17
   \end{cases}
   \]
8. We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\):
   \[
   x = 17 - y
   \]
9. Substitute \(x = 17 - y\) into the first equation:
   \[
   17 - y - 2y = 5
   \]
   \[
   17 - 3y = 5
   \]
   \[
   -3y = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3y = -12
   \]
   \[
   y = 4
   \]
10. Now substitute \(y = 4\) back into the equation \(x + y = 17\):
    \[
    x + 4 = 17
    \]
    \[
    x = 13
    \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Final answer:
\[ 155 \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants."
"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. **Smart TVs**: One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs.
   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. **Analog TVs**: One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs.
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]

3. **OLED TVs**: The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. We can find this by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold.
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
   \]

So, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money needed for the trip. The trip costs $300.

Next, we need to find out how much the school will contribute. Since the school is covering half the cost, we calculate:
\[ \text{School contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise. We know John has $50, and the total cost is $300. The school will contribute $150, so the remaining amount John needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Amount John needs to cover} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]

However, we need to subtract the amount John already has from this remaining amount:
\[ \text{Amount John still needs} = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

According to the problem, the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all her stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would be 14 days. So, she plays for 0.5 hours each day for 14 days.

\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, she plays for 2 hours each day for 7 days.

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."

"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
- Number of students who passed: 340
- Total number of third graders: 500
- Pass rate = 340 / 500 = 0.68 or 68%

For fourth graders:
- Number of students who passed: 40
- Total number of fourth graders: 100
- Pass rate = 40 / 100 = 0.40 or 40%

For fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
- Fourth graders' pass rate = 0.40
- Fifth graders' pass rate = 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 or 80%
- Number of fifth graders who passed: 400 * 0.80 = 320

Now, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school.

Total number of students:
- Third graders: 500

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find out the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}

So, on average, Felix climbed \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. She picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. She picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. She picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower she picked:
- 1 flower with 5 petals

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows to make the S'mores. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
3. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate how many games each person can play in 4 hours (240 minutes):

- Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) games
- Each of the two friends: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) games
- The better friend: \(240 \div 30 = 8\) games

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:

- Jack uses \(12 \times 1 = 12\) quarters.
- Each of the two friends uses \(24 \times 1 = 24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
- The better friend uses \(8 \times 1 = 8\) quarters.

Adding these together, the total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it further:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which represents the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and the total must be 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. However, we only need to find \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if we choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number, the equation will hold. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \), is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

First, we add the cupcakes he already has:
8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:
63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15 cupcakes

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) hours.

The total time Sandy walked over the two days is \(8 + 4 = 12\) hours.

To convert the total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\(12 \times 60 = 720\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars left in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Since each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20, we can find the total pay for one cycle by multiplying the number of tasks by the pay per task:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} \]

Next, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, we multiply the pay per cycle by the number of cycles per day:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles per day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

\[ \$180.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose. This is the difference between the book's purchase price and the refund, plus the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Money lost} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is the total monthly production minus the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ \boxed{14,000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then multiply by four to find the monthly total.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

4. **Total time spent on TikTok activities per week:**
   - Total time = Time spent recording videos + Time spent writing songs + Time spent on makeup
   - Total time per week = \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

5. **Total time spent on TikTok activities in a month:**
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time in a month = \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. Angela needs additional items:
   - 2 more mirrors (6 total - 4 already included in the base cost)
   - 1 more chandelier (2 total - 1 already included in the base cost)
   - 10 more pictures (20 total - 10 already included in the base cost)

3. The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

Now, let's calculate the additional costs:

- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Adding these to the base cost:

\[129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324\]

So, the total cost for Angela will be \(324\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

**Final answer:**
Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each part of his journey and then add those distances together.

1. **First Part of the Journey:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total Distance = Distance of First Part + Distance of Second Part
   - Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same distance. Since the speed is the same for all kangaroos, the time for one kangaroo would also be 18 hours.

Now, if one kangaroo takes 18 hours to travel the distance, and each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it means that each turtle will take twice as long to travel the same distance. Therefore, each turtle will take \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours to travel across the highway.

Since the question asks for the time it will take four turtles to travel the same distance, and since the speed of each turtle is the same, the time for four turtles to travel the distance is still determined by the speed of one turtle. Thus, the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway is 36 hours.

Final answer:
36"
"First, let's determine how many clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. So, Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. So, Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, we add up the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. So, the price after the trade-in is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

This $350 is the total amount of money Erika has from her savings, the money she earned from her part-time job, and the money her mom gave her. We know she earned $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \]
Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
\[ 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \]
The unused length of the second glue stick is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]
The unused length of the third glue stick is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters} \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

So, the change Thea received is $10."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \) (Jack has 30 socks).
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes

= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are not good at both subjects:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} = 13 \]

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (including those who are good at both subjects), we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time each group needs to perform, including the time to get on stage and exit the stage. Each group requires:

- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long. Converting 2 hours into minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

There is also a 10-minute intermission. Subtracting the intermission from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 10-minute slots fit into the 110 minutes available for performances:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand how simple interest works. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

In this case, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, let's calculate the annual interest rate. The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

This means that each year, Brenda earns $225 in interest.

Next, we calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add this total interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."

- Total white shirts: 40
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts without collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 (initial goats) - 10 (sold goats) = 45 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 (initial goats) - 20 (sold goats) = 25 goats.

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (goats left in Farm X) + 25 (goats left in Farm Y) = 70 goats.

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost for the green food:
- 3 baskets of green food at $25 each: \(3 \times 25 = 75\)

Next, calculate the total cost for the red food with the discount:
- 3 baskets of red food at $18 each: \(3 \times 18 = 54\)
- With a $2 discount for each basket of red food: \(54 - (3 \times 2) = 54 - 6 = 48\)

Now, add the total costs of the green and red food:
- Total cost: \(75 + 48 = 123\)

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"First, we need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms would be:

\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built will be \(12 + 36 = 48\).

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year. So, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years will be \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now, substitute \( Y \) and \( S \) in the sum of ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + Y - 2 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + Y - 6 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 93 \]

We also know \( Y = B - 3 \), so substitute \( Y \) in the equation:
\[ 5B + (B - 3) = 93 \]
\[ 6B - 3 = 93 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 \]
\[ Y = 16 - 3 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total.

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many full packs are needed:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so the new amount is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Now, 70 people are infected.
- Each of these 70 people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Now, 490 people are infected.
- Each of these 490 people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

So, after three days, the total number of people infected is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
2 oranges/daughter × 3 daughters = 6 oranges

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
12 oranges (initially bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige spent baking from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's a total of 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she can bake in those 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she bakes:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \$40.00 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has:

70 (gold coins) - 30 = 40 (silver coins)

Next, we need to account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos consumed is:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
   \[
   75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23
   \]

So, the number of yellow cars is:

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we have:
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( A \) in the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Final answer:
Fawn has 28 books."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, we calculate:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\$15.00\) on jello."
"First, we calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000 to the electronics seller. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's calculate how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we can find this amount by multiplying $400 by 60%.

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly cost} = 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the $400 monthly cost.

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly cost} = 400 \times 0.40 = 160 \]

Since the question asks for the amount Keenan spends per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4.

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first day.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces he ate over the three days:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far."
"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours:

\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving more from his friend.

Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Paul has left is:

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens and the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he took to the market is:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000."
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, we can find the combined sales of Micah and Mitchell by subtracting Julie's sales from the total:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's calculate how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount of money she will get is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters. Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah has after selling the original rope:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.
   \[
   \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age.
   \[
   \text{Three times her current age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24.
   \[
   8 + x = 24

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This means the final concert's runtime is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"Argo initially has 200 toys.

- He gives 40 toys to Alyssa.
- He gives 80 toys to Bonnie.
- He gives 30 toys to Nicky.

To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys.

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, subtract the total given away from the initial amount:

200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that can be paired. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[
34
\]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Now, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob and then use that to find the speed of the whirligig.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

2. Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

1. **Cost of the salad**: $6
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. **Total cost of the salad and yogurt**: $6 + $3 = $9

Given that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily diet, we can find the cost of the carrots by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost.

4. **Total cost of the carrots**: $11 - $9 = $2

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2 to find the cost of one carrot.

5. **Cost of one carrot**: $2 / 2 = $1

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 480 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
2. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each time she mowed his lawn.

First, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn:
\[ \text{Earnings from Joe's lawn} = 6J \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
\[ \text{Earnings from Kamala's lawn} = 6 \times 3J = 18J \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Alba's lawn} = 6 \times 5J = 30J \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month were $80. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 54J + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade, we need to solve for \( J \) first. Since the problem does not provide the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we assume \( J \) is a whole number. However, we can directly find the earnings from lemonade by isolating it in the equation:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54J \]

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of \( J \), we assume the simplest case where \( J = 1 \) (as it is a reasonable assumption for a small number of mowings):
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, the total hours he rents his car out each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting his car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car each month is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can find the original number of notebooks she had by subtracting 5 from 7:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had by multiplying the number of notebooks Martha originally had by 3:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

So, Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. We can find the difference by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. So, we subtract these from the total number of cookies:

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies

Now, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to understand the total amount of soup.

If the pot fills four adult's bowls, then the total amount of soup is enough for 4 adult bowls.

Now, let's see how much soup is needed for the family for one meal. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have two children. So, the family needs:
- 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife
- 2 child bowls for the children

This means the family needs a total of 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls. Therefore, the family needs:
- 4 child bowls (from the 2 adult bowls) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 6 child bowls

Calvin has enough soup to fill 8 child's bowls. After the family has their meal, the leftover soup will be:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls

Since each child can have one bowl of soup, and there are 2 child bowls left, each child will be able to have:
- 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl of soup

Final numerical answer:
Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost of the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of the ballpen is:

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

16 yards"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, let's calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, we multiply 9 by 3:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Deepa saw the movies 27 times, which means she bought 27 tickets.

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk: 1 hour

Adding these up, the total time spent on these activities is:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Next, we calculate how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his 9 red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, Tim uses 3 red shoe boxes for fishing.

Now, we subtract the used shoe boxes from the total number of each type of shoe box to find out how many are left.

For blue shoe boxes:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes left.

For red shoe boxes:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
So, there are 6 red shoe boxes left.

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age, and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \text{ acres} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, Colby earns \(\boxed{64}\) dollars in a typical eight-hour workday."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:**

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days. So, the total miles driven in a month is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups are required for 3000 miles, given that a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles. We do this by dividing the total miles driven by the interval at which tune-ups are needed:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

Bruce works a total of 23 hours over these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball.

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two activities:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:
\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information step by step to find out how many pets Larry has in total.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

The total number of pets is \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47}

"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we add the number of slices Abby and Josh eat together in a day to find the total consumption per day:
\[2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day}\]

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices per day. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:
\[24 \text{ slices} \div 6 \text{ slices per day} = 4 \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. To find out how many shells she collected, we need to calculate the number of months from age 5 to age 10.

From age 5 to age 10 is a span of 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months per year:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we divide 27 by 3:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

So, there are 9 cups in each row.

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is the same as the number of mint tea cups. Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, and the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal, we divide 9 by 2:

\[ 9 \div 2 = 4.5 \]

So, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

Final answer:
\[ 4.5 \]"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to determine how many trips the sloth can make in that time.

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, then the number of berries picked per trip is \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

**Final Answer:**
12"
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it's a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining money is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can buy one more ticket.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is:
\[5 + 1 = 6\] movies on Fridays and Saturdays, plus
\[8 + 0 = 8\] movies on other days, plus
\[1 = 1\] movie on the last day.

So, the final number of movies he can see is:
\[6 + 8 + 1 = 15\] movies.

**Final Answer: 15**"
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40,000 calories.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45,000 calories.
   - Total calories from all pastries: \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

The total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is **85,000** calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add 39 and 78:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add 78 to the result:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add 48 to the result:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add 57 to the result:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday).

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

First, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's and Peter's ages:
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons given to Maria's friends at the start of the game. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends initially is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. So, the total number of balloons at the start is:

\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding these additional balloons to the initial total, we get:

\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

\[ 24 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance = Distance spat by Zoey + Distance spat by Sydney
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

Now, we calculate the average total distance spat:
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of participants
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- In a month with 30 days, it runs \(24 \times 30 = 720\) hours.

So, the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month is:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 720 \text{ hours} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- In a month with 30 days, it runs \(24 \times 30 = 720\) hours.

So, the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month is:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 720 \text{ hours} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional hours after that. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. For the additional hours, Cameron will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The number of additional hours is:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for these additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay, using the 12-hour plus additional hours option, is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay. The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we calculate twice that amount and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \]

Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

First, let's calculate the labor charge. Since the labor is charged per hour, or part thereof, we need to round up 2.25 hours to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor charge is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge to get the total charge:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} + 105 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 205 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total charge for the job is:
\[ \boxed{205} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = \( 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \) dollars.

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn **34 dollars**."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17 \text{ hours}} \]"

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales. Each New York Times costs $5, and he gets a 10% commission on each copy. For 6 copies:

\[ \text{Commission from New York Times} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales. Each Wall Street Journal costs $15, and he gets an 8% commission on each copy. For 10 copies:

\[ \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:

\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"First, let's determine Marcus's age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to understand the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages.

Given:
- 100 pages are printed on 1 inch of paper.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

Since the paper is printed on both sides, each inch of paper contains 200 pages (100 pages per side).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 200 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 300 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, her wake-up time that day was 5 minutes before 6 a.m., which is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes, which is \(2 \times 60 + 40 = 160\) minutes.
   - Total time awake before sleepwalking: \(60 + 160 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake (including sleepwalking):**
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes.

6. **Calculate the time Kim slept on her bed:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she was awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 237 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

1/5 of 1000 beds are occupied, so:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds occupied} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of beds that will be occupied after 2 weeks (14 days) if 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Adding the initial number of occupied beds to the new admissions gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ 200 \text{ beds} + 700 \text{ beds} = 900 \text{ beds occupied} \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ 1000 \text{ beds} - 900 \text{ beds} = 100 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

**Final answer: 100 unoccupied beds.**"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are sent to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. Since the remaining emails are 3, we calculate one-third of 3:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we find the age of Shawna's father. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to understand that Courtney's reported number (48) was 20% more than the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to the problem, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number \( x \) (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be written as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Let's say Jeffrey carried \( J \) balls. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.**

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.**

After filling in 2 holes:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

**Step 3: Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.**

Number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 10 \]

Number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.**

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \, \text{miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. This is 6 brownies (since 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies).
3. When she arrived home, she had 4 dozen brownies from her friends. This is 48 brownies (since 4 dozen = 48 brownies).
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. This is 18 brownies (since 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies).

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the start of the day and how many were left after the surprise party:

- Total brownies at the start: 12 (from Greta) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.
- Brownies eaten during the surprise party: 18 brownies.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, the brother's age is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. She is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ years} \]
So, the sister's age is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:

"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (1 for himself, 1 for his wife, and 1 for each of his 2 kids).

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is:
\[ \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times \$300 = \$600 \]

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, the total cost is:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, John paid a total of:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she sold by subtracting the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is \( 79 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries. Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, the difference is:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the sales for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, using the sales from Sunday, we can determine the sales for Saturday:
- Apple pie on Saturday: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day.

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
- Apple pie: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
- Total for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24 be \(D\).
   - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will also be 5 years older.
   - Therefore, the current age of Emil's dad is \(48 - 5 = 43\).

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24 be \(B\).
   - Therefore, \(24 = 2 \times B\).
   - Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will also be 5 years younger.
   - Therefore, the current age of Emil's brother is \(12 - 5 = 7\).

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - The current age of Emil's dad is 43.
   - The current age of Emil's brother is 7.
   - Therefore, the sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means:
20 (beads from mother) + 10 = 30 beads from her sister.

Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means:
2 * 20 (beads from mother) = 40 beads from her friend.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we need to determine how many servings Joe has:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 more students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

Now, let's calculate how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- For sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost will be:

- 5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time for peeling and sautering:
- Total time = time to peel + time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner Running:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks for the electric bill per year.
2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which is another \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.
3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month for the church. Over a year, this amounts to \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks.
4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we add up all the checks:
\[12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52\]

So, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - So, the first plane goes to France and Germany for one-quarter of its flights each.

3. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - One-quarter of the first plane's 88 flights are to France.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{88}{4} = 22\).

The final numerical answer is:
22"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's determine how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we can calculate the amount from his father as follows:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam's father gave him $12.

Next, we add the amounts given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam received a total of $18 from his parents. The total cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

Given:
- \(A = 3\) (Akbar's age)
- \(B = 4\) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can write the equation for the total age of the children:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \(H = 2 \times \text{Average age}\), we can substitute the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{2 \times (3 + 4 + H + W)}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{2 \times (7 + H + W)}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{2 \times 13}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{26}{4} \]
\[ H = 6.5 \]

Now, substituting \(H = 6.5\) back into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 6.5 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 13 - 6.5 \]
\[ W = 6.5 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{6.5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:

- Money from neighbors: $500
- Money from online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. The ""everyone else"" here refers to the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2000 = $6000

However, the question also mentions that Walter's friend will give him an additional $200. This amount is not relevant to the lawyer's contribution, as the lawyer's offer is based on the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is $6000.

Final numerical answer:
$6000"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first define the size of the slices. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by the sum of all the slices, which is \( 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for his appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract this total from the desired completion time of 5:00 pm.

1. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:**
   - Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
   - Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
   - Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

2. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

3. **Calculate the number of chocolate bars in a box:**
   - Total chocolate bars = 64
   - Total boxes = 8
   - Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
   - Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"First, let's calculate the cost per session for the dance studio. The cost includes a fixed studio rental fee plus a variable cost based on the number of students.

The fixed cost per session is $25. The variable cost per session is $1.50 per student. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \$40 \text{ per day} = \$120 \]

Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$120 \text{ per week} = \$480 \]

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, and then determine the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. We know that Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 4 \times \text{(number of chocolate bars per box)} = 64 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. We know that Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 7 \times \text{(number of chocolate bars per box)} = 56 \]

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Calculating the multiplication step-by-step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating the multiplication:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, 8260 gallons of water are needed to fill the pool.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating the multiplication:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old

   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\).

So, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

1. **Wanda's contribution on the first day:**
   Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   \[
   \text{Wanda's contribution} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Ms. B's contribution on the first day:**
   Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   \[
   \text{Ms. B's contribution} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Total contribution on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total contribution} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Remaining capacity after the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining capacity} = 18000 - 7875 = 10125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Wanda's contribution on the second day:**
   Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Wanda's contribution on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Ms. B's contribution on the second day:**
   Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   \[

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before the Second Phase:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{(0.93)^3} \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]

3. **Charge Before the First Phase:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals approximately 34.8%, so:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{(0.91)^5} \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **55.7%**."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

- Hours worked per week: 40

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, let's determine the amount Janet wants to save for the down payment:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Percentage to save: 20%

Amount to save = 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, we calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000:

- Weekly savings: $1000/week
- Total savings needed: $2000

Number of weeks needed = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10. After purchasing the items, the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

- Anne has a box of 15 packs.
- Each pack contains 60 pieces.

So, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. We need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends:

- Total packs: 15
- Packs kept by Anne: 2
- Packs given to friends: \( 15 - 2 = 13 \)

Now, we need to find out how many sweets are in the 13 packs given to her friends:

- Each pack has 60 pieces.
- So, the total number of sweets given to friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we need to divide these sweets equally among her 10 friends:

- Total sweets given to friends: 780 pieces
- Number of friends: 10

So, each friend receives:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase each year to the original price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**
$139"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums are exclusively selfies and 2 albums are exclusively portraits. This means the total number of pictures in these 5 albums is:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} + 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45.

"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early. So, the number of guests after early checkouts is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests checked out late. So, the number of guests after late checkouts is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in in the afternoon is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, the number of guests after the afternoon checkins is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Dinner Checkins**: 7 more people checked in after dinner was served. So, the number of guests after the dinner checkins is:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. Each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( S = 2L \).
4. The total earnings from the sales were $120.

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \):
\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, let's find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one day:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe.

4. The amount of ore mined by one dwarf in a day with a steel pickaxe is 36 pounds.
5. Therefore, the amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in a day is \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds.
6. Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of the package with 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and Tom sells his old one for $1000. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she was left with:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\) or 20%
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 0%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8 (since there's a 20% chance he gets a personal extension, there's an 80% chance he doesn't)
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\) or 24%
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 100% or 1

Now, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher scenario: 0%
- Normal teacher with extension: 0%
- Normal teacher without extension: 24%

The total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 24%.

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for the guests:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - To find out how many small jelly beans correspond to 150 medium jelly beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium jelly beans} \times 3 \text{ small jelly beans per medium jelly bean} = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate her total parking expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out her net earnings after parking expenses, we subtract the total parking expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \, \text{dollars} - 9 \, \text{dollars} = 36 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:

\[ \frac{36 \, \text{dollars}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."

   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To set off all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 transitions (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ transitions} \times 5 \text{ seconds/transition} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. So, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. So, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money she started with:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college. Since he takes out $50,000 per year, the total loan amount is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After earning his degree, his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would have been:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

After college, he will earn $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year after college, we can find the number of years it will take to earn $300,000 by dividing $300,000 by $75,000:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is:

\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

Then, on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than this amount:

\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice the amount delivered on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

Then, on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than this amount:

\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

The total number of letters delivered Monday - Wednesday is:

\[ 736 \]"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

1. **Chicken Salad Cost:**
   - Number of people: 10

   - Total cost for chicken salad: \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars

2. **Pasta Salad Cost:**
   - Number of people: 6
   - Cost per person: $6
   - Total cost for pasta salad: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for chicken salad: $65
   - Total cost for pasta salad: $36
   - Total amount Molly will pay: \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **101 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Adding $1 to this amount: \(10 + 1 = 11\).
   - So, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total amount won: \(11\).

The net amount lost is:
\[21.5 - 11 = 10.5\]

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races (3):
\[\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\]

Rounding to the nearest cent (if necessary, but in this case, it's already precise enough for the context):
\[7.17\]

So, the average amount lost per race is:
\[\boxed{7.17}\]"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

Step 1: Number of cities in South America
- There are 26 countries in South America.
- Each country has 5 cities.
- Therefore, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).

Step 2: Total population
- Each city has 1000 people.
- Therefore, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

So, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier are to be compared in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day to hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in 3 weeks, there are \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team in 21 days is \( 21 \times 9 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

1. **Initial Price in 2007:** $20,000

2. **Price in 2008:**
   - Depreciation for 2008: \(20,000 \times 0.21 = 4,200\)
   - Price at the end of 2008: \(20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800\)

3. **Price in 2009:**
   - Depreciation for 2009: \(15,800 \times 0.21 = 3,318\)
   - Price at the end of 2009: \(15,800 - 3,318 = 12,482\)

4. **Price in 2010:**
   - Depreciation for 2010: \(12,482 \times 0.21 = 2,621.22\)
   - Price at the end of 2010: \(12,482 - 2,621.22 = 9,860.78\)

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,860.78."
"First, let's calculate the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we have:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are in German, we have:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks daily by the number of days:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Originally $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\$2400\)."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increase:
\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets
- \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do for these sheets. The machine can handle:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \div 2 = 104\) loads

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \div 1 = 52\) loads

Adding these together, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is:

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.

On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies compared to Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Now, to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

Therefore, in 4 weeks, they can watch 24 movies."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} + 3 = 10 \]

Solving for Jake's slices:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \(D + 18\) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[2D = 80\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs for each item:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: Each pill costs $4, and she needs 30 pills, so the cost is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 80 emails.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day.

Next, we need to find out how many emails he does need to respond to each day. This is the total number of emails minus the number of emails that don't require a response.

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5.

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(95\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

pizzas left.

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

pizzas. They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

pizzas left.

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the pizzas left by the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of pizzas left is:

"First, let's calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs after Mark ate plus the additional meatballs ordered.
   - \(12 \text{ meatballs} + 12 \text{ meatballs} = 24 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the final number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical issues, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
300 \text{ tons}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the cost for the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays:
- $4.00 for the first pound
- $2.00 for the second pound

So, for every 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
- He will need 3 sets of 2 pounds (since 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets).

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00

Final numerical answer:
$18.00"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 guests * $6/guest = $126

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests:

$125 + $126 = $251

The final cost of the party is $251."
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Next, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Maggie has $60 left.
Riza has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this is the daily consumption, the weekly consumption for all three monkeys is:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]
\[24 + x = \frac{315}{7}\]
\[24 + x = 45\]
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot buy 15 roses and will not receive any change.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \text{ quarters} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

"Let's break down the timeline step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes from when it arrived.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (i.e., 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes from the start).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves after 65 minutes from the start.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes from the start.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes from the start.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes from the start.

Paul boards the fourth train at 145 minutes from the start. He arrives at the station at 10 minutes, so he waits for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
135 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, given that she saves 10 toothpicks each week. We divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. 

Final answer:
\[ 8 \, \text{weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
= 0.75 * $2000
= $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
= 1.20 * $1500
= $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100%
= ($200 / $2000) * 100%
= 0.1 * 100%
= 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. **Realization and return**: James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. **Total distance walked**: James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, totaling \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.
5. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

**Final Answer:**
1 hour"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from the bunches. Since each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas and she buys 10 bunches, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\)."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year.

Given:
- The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.

First, we calculate the growth rate per year:
\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:
\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour, and then determine the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours.

1. **Bales made by the farmer per hour:** 5 bales
2. **Bales picked up by the truck per hour:** 3 bales

The net number of bales added to the field each hour is:
\[ 5 \text{ bales (made by farmer)} - 3 \text{ bales (picked up by truck)} = 2 \text{ bales} \]

Since this net addition happens each hour, over 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, after 6 hours, there are **12 bales of hay left in the field**."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the height to which the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, so the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height to which the ball bounces on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child, who is 6 feet tall, is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial conditions:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- 2 of the 3 shaken sodas and 1 unshaken soda are now gone.

So, the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 (taken by Ellen's brother) = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 1 - 1 (taken by Ellen's brother) = 0

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. Since there are no unshaken sodas left, he only takes 1 of the shaken sodas.

Now, the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 2 - 1 (taken by Ellen's brother) = 1
- Unshaken sodas: 0

Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 of the remaining sodas. Since there is only 1 shaken soda left, the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is 100%.

Final answer:
100%"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles per hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances each train has traveled:
   \[
   180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
   \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off.

- 20% of 50 days is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\) days.

So, the number of days Billy works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

- \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Finally, the total number of people he helps over 40 days is:

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:

   \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, after 5 days, his lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:

   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the discount:

3. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
4. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the discount:

5. The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
6. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

Finally, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the current balance:

7. Add the cost of the frying pan to the current balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 = 86.00
   \]
8. Add the cost of the set of towels to the new balance:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

Next, we calculate Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by using the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.**

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of days in June.**

June has 30 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day.**

Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike:

"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchase. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. Therefore, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since the 2 books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = 19 hours

**Final answer:**

"First, let's calculate the distance to John's parents' house. Since he drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph, the distance one way is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 560 \, \text{miles} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{\text{Distance Sofie walks in 7 days}}{2} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35 miles"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the number of toys produced by the first two workers:
- Each of these workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Since there are 2 such workers, they produce a total of \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the number of toys produced by the next two workers:
- Each of these workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Since there are 2 such workers, they produce a total of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's add the toys produced by the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
- The fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours they worked:
- The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
- Therefore, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\).

So, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's find the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of all the dogs together to find the total weight:
\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. This means Kris had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers before giving any to Rob.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means the 16 stickers Luis gave to Kris were the other half of his total. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces:

- Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&M, 30 ounces will contain \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&M.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

- The total number of small bags he can make is \(900 \div 10 = 90\).

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags."

"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:

\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as \( A \) and the number of eggs Madeline painted as \( M \). Since they painted the same number, \( A = M \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \). So, \( C + S = 30 \).
4. **Camden Painted 12 More Than Sarah**: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

Now, we can substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since \( C = S + 12 \), Camden painted:
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]
So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since the total number of eggs painted is 56, and we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, Arnold and Madeline together painted:
\[ 56 - 30 = 26 \]
Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as \( A \) and the number of eggs Madeline painted as \( M \). So, \( A + M = 26 \) and \( A = M \). Therefore:
\[ A + A = 26 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood.

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes from selling the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie and her brother earn combined:

\[ \text{Combined earnings} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we calculate her earnings as:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 45000 \]"
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, we can calculate her speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she spends 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk, the total time for her 3-mile walk is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ \text{Answer: } 7 \]"
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each tree.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the final tree, which had 3 blue birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, the equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has is:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to understand that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the mixture in the bottle is drinkable, meaning it is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the bottle, the temperature of the mixture in the bottle will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the weighted average temperature \( T_{\text{mix}} \) is:

\[ T_{\text{mix}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} \]

Since the mixture is drinkable, we know that:

\[ T_{\text{mix}} \geq 40 \]

Substituting the expression for \( T_{\text{mix}} \):

\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
4. **Total cows added in three weeks**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
5. **Total cows after three weeks**: 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
7. **Chickens added per day**: 10
8. **Total chickens added in three weeks**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
9. **Total chickens after three weeks**: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

10. **Total number of animals after three weeks**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

\[ 10\% \times \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 less than 3 scoops:**
   - 1 less than 3 scoops is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

3. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for 2 scoops.

4. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, we need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) sets of 2 scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \) potatoes.

**Final Answer:**
27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's determine the number of red jellybeans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jellybeans are either green or red. We add the number of green and red jellybeans together:

\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14}\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet is sold for $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Sunflowers from individual sales: 13
   - Sunflowers from bouquets: 84
   - Total sunflowers sold per day is \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day: 97
   - Number of days: 3

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket
The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be written as 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners
The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\) seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:
\[27 + 22 + 11 = 60\]

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:
\[\frac{60}{3} = 20\]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots from Monday to Friday.

"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since he earns a profit of $20 per device, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each juice bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces:**
   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles needed is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 bow-wearers, 2 are purple-wearers. Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( 50\% \)."

First, let's add up the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1907 reports
- Thursday and Friday: 2136 reports

Total for these days: \(1907 + 2136 = 4043\) reports

Now, subtract this total from the overall total of reports received last week:
- Total reports received last week: 5168 reports

Reports received on Wednesday: \(5168 - 4043 = 1125\)

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold this 40 square meters for $50. 

Next, we need to find out how much land he has left after the first sale:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Then, he sold a quarter of the remaining 40 square meters:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold these 10 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land he has left after the second sale:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[ \boxed{170} \]"
"First, we need to find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, we need to find Geb's age, which is 10 less than half of Haley's age. So, we subtract 10 from 13:

\( 13 - 10 = 3 \).

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

For 2 days, the number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs in total, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
9"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

So, the third complex has:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree. According to the problem, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

Now, we can sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

To find 1/5 of $100, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we need to find out how much money Jack has in total after receiving the $20 from Sophia. Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 from Sophia:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Then, substituting \( B \) into the first relationship, we get \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, we have:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints and 6 pints are yellow, the remaining 6 pints are used for red, white, and purple. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days is:
\[ \boxed{93} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you have $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 twenty-dollar bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 twenty-dollar bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

**Final numerical answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. Therefore, the remaining length of the chalk is:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the length of chalk used each day is:
\[ 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it needs to be recycled.**

The teacher will need to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be reduced to less than 2 inches. The chalk starts at 2.75 inches and is reduced by 0.55 inches each day. We can set up the following equation to find the number of days, \(d\):
\[ 2.75 - 0.55d < 2 \]

Solving for \(d\):
\[ 2.75 - 2 < 0.55d \]
\[ 0.75 < 0.55d \]
\[ d > \frac{0.75}{0.55} \]
\[ d > 1.3636 \]

Since \(d\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it needs to be recycled.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 17 \]"
"Mike bought 5 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we first calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Then, we add 2 to this number to find out how many masks Johnny bought:

\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's determine how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth. So, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist. This includes both the teeth that were drilled and the teeth that were capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{number of teeth fixed}}{\text{total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

To find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

To find the total refund:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one set of 100 books:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the money is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

1800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket, so he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 apple in his hand.
3. He threw the apple in his hand into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples in his hand.
4. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, so he now has 1 apple in his pocket (from before) + 1 apple from the 5 he picked up = 2 apples in his pocket, and 1 apple in his hand.
5. He threw the apple in his hand at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 2 apples in his pocket and 6 apples in his hand.
6. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home. So, he now has 2 apples in his pocket + 6 apples in his hand = 8 apples.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices they will eat:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required:

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per 15 Minutes:**
   - In 15 minutes, Jay builds 20/4 = 5 snowballs (since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour).
   - Out of these, 2 snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs built in 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

4. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour:**
   - Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net number of snowballs built in an hour is 3 snowballs/15 minutes * 4 = 12 snowballs.

5. **Time to Build 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs built per hour.
   - Time = 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and assuming it started in 1999 (a common starting year for anime series), it would be 2023 now (1999 + 20 years = 2019, and we are in 2023).

2. **Calculate the age difference between John and Jim:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - When Digimon came out (in 1999), John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let's denote Jim's age in 1999 as \( x \). Therefore, John's age in 1999 was \( 2x \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The difference in their ages remains constant over time.
   - John's current age (28) minus his age in 1999 (\( 2x \)) should equal Jim's current age minus his age in 1999 (\( x \)).
   - So, \( 28 - 2x = x - x \) (since the difference in their ages is constant).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( 28 - 2x = x \)
   - \( 28 = 3x \)
   - \( x = \frac{28}{3} \)
   - \( x = 9.33 \)

5. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Jim's age in 1999 was \( 9.33 \).
   - Since 2023 is 24 years after 1999, Jim's current age is \( 9.33 + 24 \).
   - \( 9.33 + 24 = 33.33 \)

Since ages are typically expressed as whole numbers, and considering the context of the problem, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, the exact answer based on the given information is:

Jim is 33 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."

   - They had 78 bandages left.

2. **Third day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(0.5 \times 50 = 25\) bandages.
   - Before using the bandages, they had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages.
   - Before ordering the two bulk packs, they had \(103 - 100 = 3\) bandages at the start of the third day.

3. **Second day:**
   - They used ten fewer bandages than the first day, so if they used \(x\) bandages on the first day, they used \(x - 10\) bandages on the second day.
   - At the end of the second day, they had 3 bandages left.
   - Before using the bandages on the second day, they had \(3 + (x - 10) = x - 7\) bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of bandages, which is 50 bandages, so before ordering, they had \(x - 7 - 50 = x - 57\) bandages at the start of the second day.

4. **First day:**
   - They used 38 bandages on the first day.
   - Before using the bandages, they had \(x - 57 + 38 = x - 19\) bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of bandages, which is 50 bandages, so before ordering, they had \(x - 19 - 50 = x - 69\) bandages at the start of the first day.

Since they ordered one bulk pack of bandages on the first day, they must have started with 69 bandages to end up with 0 bandages before ordering the pack. Therefore, they started with \(x - 69 = 0\) bandages, which means \(x = 69\).

So, they started with 69 bandages on the first day.

**Final Answer:**
69"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. The difference in hair length is 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches. The cost per inch of the haircut is $30, so the cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is $60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:
$100"
"First, let's calculate Jen's earnings based on her hourly rate and the number of hours she works in April.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. Therefore, the number of hours she works in a week is:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, the total number of hours she works in April is:
\[ 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours} \]

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5. Therefore, her earnings from her hourly rate in April are:
\[ 180 \, \text{hours} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/hour} = 270 \, \text{\$} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ 270 \, \text{\$} + 10 \, \text{\$} = 280 \, \text{\$} \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once, earning $3.00.
2. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once, earning $1.50.
3. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason took the trash out twice, earning $0.75 each time. So, for two times, he earned \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\).
4. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, earning $0.50 each time. So, for six times, he earned \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\).

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00\]

So, the total amount of money Jason earned is \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in a shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks as follows:

\[ \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"First, let's calculate the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of black pens. According to the problem, the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people. So, the amount each person gets is:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.

Amy had:
- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, we account for the colors stolen by her sister. Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\]

Subtracting these 3 colors from the remaining total:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \)
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling: \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \)

The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk in a day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
4 miles."
"First, we calculate the loan amount John gets by taking 40% of his home's value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount for this purpose.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money he has leftover after paying his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"First, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72.

To find the selling price, we multiply $72 by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting for the specified number of days.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, which is \( 2 \times 1 \, \text{liter/day} = 2 \, \text{liters/day} \).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, which is \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{liters/day} = 4 \, \text{liters/day} \).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we add up the total water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs, with each pack containing 30 balloons. So, the total number of balloons is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of the second medicine:**
   - Saanvi combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
   - Therefore, the amount of the second medicine is \( 14 \times 3 = 42 \) mL.

2. **Calculate the total amount of medicine for one dose:**
   - For one dose, the total amount of medicine is the sum of the first and second medicines.
   - So, \( 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of medicine for 8 doses:**
   - If one dose is 56 mL, then 8 doses would be \( 56 \times 8 \).

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 56 \times 8 = 448 \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \( 448 \) mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has the capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300.

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months.

\[ \text{Total paid in 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount paid in 11 months from the total amount to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

\[ \text{Amount to be paid in the twelfth month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. So, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, he changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and the estimated number is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of people on the bus after the first stop**: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of people on the bus after the second stop**: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
6. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.

7. **Remaining spaces on the bus**: \(200 - 180 = 20\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost increases by 1.5 times the original cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Therefore, the cost for one year is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

For 5 years, the total cost is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases to $5. For the next 3 years, the cost for one year is:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

For 3 years, the total cost is:

\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Adding the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years gives the total amount Pauline spent:

\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide the total number of students by the group size:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, the total time required is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of wooden tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."

   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"First, we need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we multiply 35 inches by 5:

\[ 35 \, \text{inches/window} \times 5 \, \text{windows} = 175 \, \text{inches} \]

Next, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 350 \, \text{inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The total call duration is 36 minutes, so the remaining minutes after the first 16 minutes = 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes.
   - The cost per minute for the remaining 20 minutes is $0.20.
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00.

3. **Total cost of the call:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00."

1. Determine the amount of rain on Monday.
2. Calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday.
3. Add 1 inch to the result from step 2 to find the expected rain on Tuesday.

Step 1: The amount of rain on Monday is 2 inches.

Step 2: Twice the amount of rain on Monday is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.

Step 3: The expected rain on Tuesday is \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cupcakes be \( c \).
2. According to the problem, the number of brownies is \( 3c - 2 \).
3. Each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is equal to 10. So, we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[
   3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[
36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the total number of magazines:

- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues

Thus, the total number of magazines is:
\[
3 + 1 + 1 = 5
\]

Susan gets 5 magazines every year."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about Samantha's paintings.

1. Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's number of paintings:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]

So, the new price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price went down by 50% of $72.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]

So, the price after the decrease in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up all the scores.
2. Divide the total by the number of quizzes.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Next, we divide the total by the number of quizzes. Sally has taken 9 quizzes.

Mean score = Total sum of scores / Number of quizzes
Mean score = 630 / 9
Mean score = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24 of them.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining 36 apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36.

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he gave 9 to his sister.

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Therefore, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he doesn't stop at all during the day, which is an ideal scenario), the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes used by her brother as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of grapes used for the pies. Since the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes at the beginning by adding the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School.
2. Subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers to the remaining number of teachers.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of teachers: 82
2. Number of sick teachers: 13
3. Number of substitute teachers: 9

First, subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, add the number of substitute teachers to the remaining number of teachers:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the final number of teachers at school that day is:
\[ 78 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for one batch of macaroni and cheese:

1. The cost of pasta is $1.00.
2. The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
3. The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's add up the costs for one batch:
\[1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00\]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), the total cost is:
\[10.00 \times 52 = 520.00\]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe.

To find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) and the total time available in a day (480 minutes):

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

However, this calculation assumes the custodian works continuously without breaks, which is not realistic. Given the 5-day timeframe, the custodian spends:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ 50\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer:**
2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The cost per dozen is $2.40, so the total cost for five dozens is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of beef jerky is 50 cents.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions across both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we determine how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes, \( B \), is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write this as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes, which is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games she has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game.

First, we know that Ara plays 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we know that she scores 21 points in each game. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in 160 games is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This left him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. He then found 3 more, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, he found that one of them was not a marble but a bead, so he got rid of it. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate the number of each item separately and then add them together.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + (2 * 8) (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16
   - Total flashlights = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in total.
   - Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Total candles = (4 * 4) (small candles) + (4 * 5) (medium candles)
   - Total candles = 16 + 20
   - Total candles = 36

3. **Total items:**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36
   - Total items = 56

**Final numerical answer:**

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since all sides are completed once the fifth side is done, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 5 minutes

Adding these times together:

\[5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35\]

So, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 35 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. **Number of Helmets**: 20
2. **Number of Robots**: Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
3. **Number of Footballs**: Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \).

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:

\[ 10 \text{ (robots)} + 20 \text{ (helmets)} + 40 \text{ (footballs)} = 70 \]

**Total number of items Dominick saw**: 70"
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes to dry one painting.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes to dry one painting.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.

The difference in drying time is:
\[72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering needs of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants = \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total number of plants = 20.
   - Plants needing half a cup and 1 cup = \(4 + 8 = 12\) plants.
   - Therefore, the rest of the plants = \(20 - 12 = 8\) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find out how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land and swim in water, and then add these times together.

1. **Total distance to return home**: 200 yards.
2. **Half of the distance on land**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards.
3. **Half of the distance in water**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey.

4. **Time to hop on land**: 
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute.
   - Distance on land = 100 yards.
   - Time on land = \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Time to swim in water**: 
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute.
   - Distance in water = 100 yards.
   - Time in water = \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water to find the total time.

6. **Total time**: 
   - Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"First, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks needed by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \$14.00 \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \).

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we have:
\[ 20 = 2x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

2. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June:**
   - June typically has 30 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is \(120 \times 30 = 3600\) doughnuts.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts:**
   - Each doughnut is sold for $2.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \(3600 \times 2 = 7200\) dollars.

So, Derrick makes \(\boxed{7200}\) dollars in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"First, let's calculate the total number of photos Jade has and how many she uploads each day.

Jade has taken a total of 210 photos.

She uploads 7 photos in one batch and does this 6 times a day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing per week:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost per week:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00 per week

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 per week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time in minutes is given by:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people} \]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people} \]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add up the number of people Conor saw each day to get the total for the week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ 480 \]"
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, he will need 5 cups of fresh lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for each type of dog and then extend that to a week.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
- The total daily consumption is \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- The total weekly consumption is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 since a pair consists of 2 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\).

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs on the farm:
- Total legs = \(20 + 60 = 80\).

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
- Number of pairs of legs = \(80 \div 2 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in each direction and then determine his final distance from his house.

1. **Distance traveled west:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Net distance from the house:**
   - Distance traveled west: 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east: 144 miles
   - Since he traveled east after traveling west, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.
   - Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the boat's value after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000

"To find out how many pink candies there are, we first need to determine the number of each type of candy in the bag, except for the pink ones.

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, the number of orange candies is \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.

Therefore, the total amount they pay is **38 dollars**."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together.

Total weight of the children = 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Now, we add the weight of the car, luggage, and children to get the total weight:

Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01 (which is the decimal form of 1%).

Force needed = 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push with a force of 16 pounds to move the car."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):

- The older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother.
- Therefore, the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Next, calculate the total age of the siblings:
- The total age of the 3 sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.
- The total age of the 2 brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.

Finally, add the total ages of the sisters and the brothers:
- Total age of all siblings = \(48 + 36 = 84\) years.

The total age of all these siblings is 84."
"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on meditation over 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, over 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days. Therefore, the total time spent on meditation is \(30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 840 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, let's calculate the time spent on yoga. She practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the total time spent on yoga per week is \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week}\). Over 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is \(300 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga to get the overall time spent on both practices. The total time is \(840 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 2040 \text{ minutes}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
2040"
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then sum these values.

1. **Small T-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from small t-shirts: \( 11 \times 3 = 33 \) square feet.

2. **Medium T-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from medium t-shirts: \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet.

3. **Large T-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from large t-shirts: \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet.

Now, we sum the square footage from all the t-shirts to get the total square footage of the quilt:
\[ 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \]

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is \( 101 \) square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and one dozen equals 12, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, we determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Albert is 36 inches tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is:

\[ 36 \times 2 = 72 \text{ inches tall} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, her height before the summer was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was \(\boxed{67}\) inches tall before the summer."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the produced bars.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 bars in one day.

Step 2: There are 14 days in two weeks. So, the number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 3: The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

The company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

1. The first T-shirt costs $8.
2. The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) dollars.

The total cost for the T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

1. The discount on the shoes is \(40 \times 0.4 = 16\) dollars.
2. The sale price of the shoes is \(40 - 16 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

1. Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
2. Total cost = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. Since there are 4 people, the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \times 4 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Ryan only has $13 left, he cannot afford to buy 4 movie tickets. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we divide the amount of money he has by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

**Final Answer:**

\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:

- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- She also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.

So, the cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Adding the cost of the sunglasses:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, let's add up the total spending of both Ellen and Lani:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ 335 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Next, we calculate the profit for one jar:
- Selling price per jar = $50
- Cost per jar = $44
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

Now, we calculate the total profit for 10 jars:
- Total profit = $6/jar * 10 jars = $60

Final numerical answer:
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent at the mall.

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount given by her parents:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has \(\boxed{13}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

First, we calculate the number of toy soldiers in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, Matthew will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

Next, we calculate the total money earned from selling the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the total money earned from selling the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate can fill in a day. He fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, so the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \, \text{holes/day} - 6 \, \text{holes/night} = 3 \, \text{holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

The total number of cookies made is 7995.
The number of rainbow cookies is 2595.
The number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 (rainbow cookies) + 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 5670

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
7995 (total cookies) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal cookies) = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers he actually brought as \( x \)

3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - 5 = 2
\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs in the second basket.
2. Add the number of eggs in both baskets together.

Step 1: The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the second basket has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs.

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find Aaron's speed, we divide the distance by the time:

\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed:

\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Using her speed, we can calculate the time:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line. So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total cost for one night is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(15 \times 2 = \$30\).

However, the question asks how much they make, not how much they spend. Since the problem does not specify any revenue from the reservations, we can assume they make the same amount as their cost, which is $30 per night for 2 days.

Therefore, the amount they make a week is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's find the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. So, James's current age is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 32 when his son James was born, and James is currently 18, John is currently \(32 + 18 = 50\) years old.

The question asks how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. Since the problem does not specify the age of John's youngest son, we can infer that the youngest son mentioned is James, as he is the only son whose age we have information about. Therefore, in 3 years, James will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges in an hour.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges in an hour.
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic's work. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
