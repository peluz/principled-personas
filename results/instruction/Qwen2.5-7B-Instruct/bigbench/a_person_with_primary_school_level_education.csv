"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. So, if the guitarist is in house 3, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 2. But house 2 is already taken by the flutist, so the guitarist must be in house 4, and the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1, and the person with a carnations arrangement must be in house 2.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. Since the flutist is in house 2, the pianist must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Person with carnations
- House 3: Person with a vase of tulips
- House 4: Person with a bouquet of lilies and the pianist

The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 3.

So, the answer is (D) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
4. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
5. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
6. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
7. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

From clues 1, 4, and 5, we know the root beer lover cannot be in the first house because the person who only drinks water and the person who has a television must be to the left of the root beer lover. So, the root beer lover must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the cellist and the person with the gameboy must be in the second and third houses, or the first and second houses. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the cellist and the gameboy must be in the first and second houses.

From clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must live in the third house. This means the cellist must live in the second house.

So, the cellist lives in house number 2."

17. The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From clue 15, we know the tennis player lives in the fifth house. From clue 13, the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person eating a banana. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the person eating a banana must be in the fourth house. This means the person eating oranges is in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the second house. From clue 8, the baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges, so the baseball player is in the second house, and the person eating oranges is in the third house. This means the person who likes red is the baseball player.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana. Since the person eating a banana is in the fourth house, the person wearing sandals is in the third house. This means the person eating oranges is in the third house, and the person who likes red (baseball player) is in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other. Since the person wearing sandals is in the third house, the person wearing loafers is in the fourth house. This means the person eating a banana is in the fourth house, and the person eating oranges is in the third house.

From clue 14, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes red (baseball player) is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue is in the second house. This means the person who likes red is the coffee drinker.

From clue 17, the basketball player does not live in the second house. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the baseball player is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the fifth house. This means the tennis player is in the fifth house, and the person who likes red (baseball player) is in the second house.

From clue 12, the root beer lover does not live in the first or third house. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating oranges is in the third house, the root beer lover must be in the fourth house. This means the person eating a banana is in the fourth house, and the person eating oranges is in the third house.

From clue 19, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the root beer lover is in the fourth house, the person eating grapes must be in the fifth house. This means the person who likes green is in the fifth house.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. The answer is (E) 5."

1. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
3. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
4. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

11. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
12. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels.

From clue 9, the person in the first house is eating apples.

From clue 12, the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live next to each other. Since the first house is eating apples, the second house must be eating either pizza or mangos.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker. So, the second house must be eating pizza and the third house must be eating mangos.

From clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker. So, the fourth house must be the coffee drinker and the third house must be the tea drinker (since the third house is wearing high heels and the person in the third house is not the coffee drinker).

From clue 1, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the third house is the tea drinker, the second house must be driving a truck and the fourth house must be driving an SUV.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the second house is driving a truck, the first house must be wearing loafers and the second house must be driving a convertible.

From clue 6, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the second house is driving a truck, the fourth house must have eaten fried rice.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the first house is wearing loafers, the third house must have eaten spaghetti and the fourth house must be wearing running shoes.

From clue 11, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the third house is the tea drinker and the fourth house is wearing running shoes, the first house must be the root beer lover.

So, the tea drinker lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, as stated in Clue 1. So, the answer is (A) 5."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the swimmer and the person with daffodils are next to each other. So, we can have:
- Swimmer-Daffodils
- Daffodils-Swimmer

From clue 4, the person with daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. So, oranges can't be in the rightmost house (house 3), because then daffodils would have to be in house 4, which doesn't exist.

Now, let's use clue 1 and 3 to place the other people:
- Soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges.
- Vase of tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos.

Let's try to place the people in the houses:

If the soccer player is in house 1, then the person eating oranges must be in house 2 or 3. But if oranges are in house 2, then the person with daffodils must be in house 3, which means the person with tulips can't be in house 3 (clue 3). So, oranges must be in house 3, and the person with daffodils is in house 2.

Now, the soccer player is in house 1, and the person eating oranges is in house 3. The person with daffodils is in house 2.

So, the person with daffodils lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
7. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
8. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Violinist

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2 or 3: Spaghetti

From clue 3 and 4, we know:
- The percussionist cannot be in House 1 (because the violinist is there), and the percussionist must be to the left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. So, the percussionist can only be in House 2 or 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The mystery book reader is to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff is somewhere to the right of the person with a vase of tulips and there is one house between the radio and the history book buff.

From clue 7, we know:
- The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are next to each other.

From clue 8, we know:
- The history book buff is to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

Let's put the pieces together:

- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Can't be the percussionist (because the violinist is in House 1), can't be the person with a vase of tulips (because the history book buff is to the right of the person with a vase of tulips), and can't be the person with a radio (because there is one house between the radio and the history book buff).

So, House 2 must be the person who ate fried rice (clue 3 and 2).

- House 3: Can't be the percussionist (because the violinist is in House 1 and the percussionist must be to the left of the bouquet of daffodils), can't be the person with a vase of tulips (because the history book buff is to the right of the person with a vase of tulips), and can't be the person with a radio (because there is one house between the radio and the history book buff).

So, House 3 must be the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 4).

- House 2: Fried rice
- House 3: Bouquet of daffodils

Since the history book buff is to the right of the person with a vase of tulips and there is one house between the radio and the history book buff, the only place left for the history book buff is House 3, and the radio must be in House 1.

- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Fried rice
- House 3: Bouquet of daffodils (history book buff)

The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are next to each other, and the history book buff is in House 3, so the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Vase of tulips
- House 3: Bouquet of daffodils (history book buff)

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the second house.
2. From clue 1, the bird keeper does not live in the first house.
3. From clue 3, the bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. So, the bird keeper must live in the second house.
5. But we already know the mystery book reader is in the second house, so this can't be true. Let's recheck the clues and see if we missed something.

Rechecking:
- The bird keeper can't be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second house.
- The mystery book reader is in the second house, so the bird keeper can't be there.
- The bird keeper must be in the first or third house.

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
- This means the history book buff and the bouquet of lilies person must be in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses.

Since the mystery book reader is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the bouquet of lilies person must be in the third house.

Now, let's use clue 5:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
- This means the percussionist and the computer person must be in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses.

Since the history book buff is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the first house, and the computer person must be in the second house.

Now, we know:
- First house: History book buff, percussionist
- Second house: Mystery book reader, computer
- Third house: Bouquet of lilies

Using clue 7:
- The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
- This means the gameboy person and the rose bouquet person must be in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses.

Since the percussionist is in the first house and the computer person is in the second house, the gameboy person must be in the first house, and the rose bouquet person must be in the second house.

So, the gameboy person is in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

- **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses is in house 3, the radio and carnations arrangement can be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot live in house 1 because there's no house to the left of house 1. So, the history book buff must live in house 2, and the person who drives a convertible must live in house 1.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. Since the history book buff lives in house 2, the person who is wearing boots must be the history book buff.

3. This means the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 1, because the history book buff (who wears boots) lives in house 2.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 3). This means the mystery book reader and the history book buff must be in houses 2 and 3, or houses 3 and 4. But since the golfer is in house 1, the mystery book reader and the history book buff can only be in houses 2 and 3.
3. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover (Clue 1). This means the swimmer and the romance book lover must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3, or houses 3 and 4. But since the golfer is in house 1, the swimmer and the romance book lover can only be in houses 2 and 3.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house (Clue 4). So, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the romance book lover must be in house 3.
5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the basketball player must be in house 2, 3, or 1. But house 2 is taken by the swimmer, so the basketball player must be in house 1 or 3.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The root beer lover lives in the third house (Clue 5).
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 7). So, the third house is for both the root beer lover and the person who likes red.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 8). This means the romance book lover is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 3.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house, so the history book buff is also in the third house (Clue 5 and Clue 8).
5. The tea drinker does not live in the second house (Clue 9), so the tea drinker must live in house 1 or 4.
6. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green (Clue 2). Since the history book buff is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.
7. There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives (Clue 1). Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes white must be in the first house.
8. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house (Clue 6), so the mystery book reader must live in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is for the person who likes white, and house 3 is for the history book buff. So, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.
9. The history book buff is in the third house, and the romance book lover is in the second house. So, the only book left is science fiction for the first house.

- House 3: History Book, Coffee Drinker
- House 4: Red, Root Beer, Tea

"Let's think about this step by step:

2. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (Clue 3), so the fish enthusiast must live in the second house.
3. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Clue 1). Since the first house is on the left, the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who has a radio must live in the second house.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Dog owner lives in the second house.** (Clue 4)
2. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.** (Clue 1)
3. **The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.** (Clue 2)

17. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.** (Clue 17)
18. **The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.** (Clue 18)

Let's start placing the known information:

- **Dog owner in house 2.** (Clue 4)
- **Dog owner and the person who likes red live next to each other.** (Clue 14) So, the person who likes red must be in house 1 or 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11: **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.** So, the coffee drinker must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

Since the dog owner is in house 2, and the person who likes red is next to the dog owner, the person who likes red must be in house 1.

Now, let's use Clue 12: **The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live next to each other.** And Clue 13: **There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.**

If the person who likes red is in house 1, the person who owns horses must be in house 3 or 4. If the person who owns horses is in house 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the person who likes red. So, the person who owns horses must be in house 4, and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

Now, the person who likes red is in house 1, the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses is in house 4, and the person who had pizza is in house 2. This is a contradiction, so the person who owns horses must be in house 3, and the person who had pizza must be in house 5.

Now, the person who likes red must be in house 1, and the person who owns horses is in house 3. The person who had pizza is in house 5.

Now, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who likes milk must be in house 1, and the person who likes blue must be in house 2.

The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5. But house 1 is taken by the person who likes red, and house 2 is taken by the person who likes milk. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4 or 5. But house 4 is taken by the person who owns horses, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 5.

The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is taken by the person who likes red, and house 2 is taken by the person who likes milk. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

The person who likes yellow lives two houses to the left of the romance book lover. So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is taken by the person who likes red, and house 2 is taken by the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 3.

The person who only drinks water must be in house 4, because all other houses are taken.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in house 4.

The answer is (E) 4."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Here's how we can figure this out:

1. From clue 8, we know the tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. From clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house.
3. From clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house.
4. From clue 2, the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
5. Since the flutist is in the first house, the guitarist cannot be in the first house. So, the person eating kiwis must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.
6. From clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second, third, or fourth house.
7. From clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. So, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
8. From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses.
9. From clue 1, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. So, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, the person who owns horses in the third house, and the cellist in the fourth house.
10. From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who only drinks water is in the second house and the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who is eating apples must be in the fourth house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the first house.
11. From clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house, but we already know the person who likes milk is in the third house.
12. From clue 9, the tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (kiwis), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker in the third house.
13. The bird keeper is in the second house, the tea drinker in the third house, the person who likes milk in the third house (conflict, but we know milk is in the third), the person who only drinks water in the second house, the fish enthusiast in the second house, the person who owns horses in the third house, the cellist in the fourth house, the person who is eating apples in the fourth house, and the person who is eating oranges in the first house.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. The person eating oranges lives to the left of the person eating apples.
3. The person with a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other.
9. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. The person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From clues 6 and 8, we know that the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other. This means the person who had pizza, the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who has a vase of tulips are in consecutive houses.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other. So, the person who had stew must be in the house directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 1, the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who had stew must be in house 1, the person with a rose bouquet in house 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 3.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1, the person with a rose bouquet in house 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 3.

From clue 2, the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person eating apples. From clue 10, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos. So, the person who is eating oranges, apples, and mangos must be in houses 4, 5, and 1 respectively.

From clue 9, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. So, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 2.

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 5.

From clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 4, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 5.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The cat lover lives in the first house.
2. The person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. So, if the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in house 2.
3. The person with daffodils does not live in the second house, so daffodils must be in house 1, 3, or 4.
4. There is one house between the horse owner and the carnations. This means if the horse owner is in house 1, carnations must be in house 3, and so on.
5. The lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner.

Let's place the cat lover in house 1. So, the cat lover is in house 1.

Since the tulips owner is directly left of the dog owner, and the tulips cannot be in house 2 (because the daffodils are not in house 2), the tulips must be in house 3, and the dog owner must be in house 4.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Horses

The daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. But house 1 and 3 are already taken, so daffodils must be in house 4. This means the horse owner is in house 4, and the daffodils are in house 4.

Now, we need to place the carnations. There is one house between the horse owner and the carnations. Since the horse owner is in house 4, the carnations must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Carnations
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Horses and daffodils

The only pet left is the fish, and the only house left is house 3. So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with the phone lives in the first house.
2. The person with boots does not live in the second house, so the person with boots must live in the first house.
3. The person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other. Since the person with the phone is in the first house, the person with the radio must be in the second house (because the person with boots is in the first house and cannot have the radio).

So, we have:
- House 1: Phone and boots
- House 2: Radio and horses

The only thing left is the high heels and the dog. Since the person with high heels cannot be in the second house (because the second house has horses), the person with high heels must be in the first house, and the person with the dog must be in the second house.

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
7. The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
10. The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.

From clues 1, 9, and 10, we can deduce that the person with the computer and the person with the loafers live next to each other, and the person with the computer is to the left of the person with the phone. This means the computer, loafers, and phone must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 2, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house, and from clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. This means the grilled cheese person and the computer person must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 7, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house, and from clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house. This means the person with the loafers must be in house 1, and the person with the computer must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, so the person who is eating apples must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person with the boots cannot be in house 3, and the person with the grapes must be in house 3, the person with the boots must be in house 1.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. Since the person with the phone is in house 2, the person with blue must be in house 3.

From clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person with the yellow must be in house 3, the person with the mangos must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Grilled Cheese, Blue
- House 2: Loafers, Pizza, Yellow
- House 3: Boots, Mangos, Green

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The baseball player lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player does not live in the first house and lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The bird keeper does not live in the first or third house.
5. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
6. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, the dog owner and fish enthusiast must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But the baseball player is in the second house, so the dog owner must be in the first house and the fish enthusiast in the second house.

From clue 2, the basketball player is not in the first house and is to the left of the swimmer. So, the basketball player must be in the second house, but we already know the baseball player is there, so the basketball player must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third or fourth house.

From clue 5, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the tennis player and cat lover must be in the first and second houses, but the baseball player is in the second house, so the tennis player must be in the first house and the cat lover in the second house. This means the basketball player is in the first house, which is not possible as per clue 2. So, the basketball player must be in the third house, and the swimmer in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the bird keeper does not live in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 3**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the sedan and SUV are neighbors, like house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 3.

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. So, the SUV can't be in house 3 because then there would be no house to the right for the swimmer. This means the SUV is in house 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 3 and 4 together**: If the SUV is in house 1, the sedan must be in house 2, and the swimmer must be in house 3. If the SUV is in house 2, the sedan must be in house 1, and the swimmer must be in house 3. But we need to check other clues to decide.

4. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives. This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue can't be neighbors.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer. This means the person with the computer can't be in house 3.

6. **Clue 5**: The violinist does not live in the first house. So, the violinist can only be in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. This means they are neighbors, like house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- If the SUV is in house 1, the sedan is in house 2, and the swimmer is in house 3. This fits with clue 4.
- The person who likes white can't be in house 3 (clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person with the computer can't be in house 3 (clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2.
- The violinist can't be in house 1 (clue 5), so they must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy are neighbors (clue 6).

If the sedan is in house 2, the gameboy must be in house 1, and the computer must be in house 3. This fits with all clues.

So, the layout could be:
- House 1: Gameboy, Blue, SUV
- House 2: Sedan, White, Violinist
- House 3: Computer, Yellow, Soccer player

The soccer player lives in house 3.

From clue 2, the person eating oranges is to the right of the person eating kiwis. From clue 7, the person eating oranges is to the left of the person with a television.

Let's start placing the clues:

- Since the pianist is not in the first house (clue 1), the pianist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 (because the person eating oranges is to the right of the person eating kiwis, and the person eating oranges is to the left of the person with a television, so the person eating kiwis must be in house 1).
- The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (because the person eating kiwis is in house 1 and the person eating oranges is to the right of the person eating kiwis).

8. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.** (Clue 11)
9. **The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.** (Clue 19)

From Clue 1, we know the soccer player is in House 1. Since the soccer player and the baseball player live next to each other (Clue 15), the baseball player must be in House 2.

Now, let's place the mystery book reader and the person who had stew. Since they live next to each other (Clue 5) and the mystery book reader is to the left of the person who had stew (Clue 20), and the person who had stew is to the right of the swimmer (Clue 2), the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in House 3 and House 4, respectively. The swimmer must be in House 2.

Since the soccer player is in House 1 and the baseball player is in House 2, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are in House 3 and House 4, respectively. The person who ate fried rice and the swimmer live next to each other (Clue 12), so the person who ate fried rice must be in House 1, which is the soccer player, but this is not possible as the soccer player is already in House 1. So, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2, which is the baseball player.

Now, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are in House 3 and House 4, respectively. The person who ate stew is in House 4, and the mystery book reader is in House 3.

Since the romance book lover is to the left of the person who is eating grapes (Clue 6), and the person who is eating grapes is to the right of the mystery book reader (Clue 20), the romance book lover must be in House 2, and the person who is eating grapes must be in House 4. This means the mystery book reader is in House 3.

Now, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples (Clue 11), and the flutist does not live in the fifth house (Clue 16). So, the flutist must be in House 4 or House 5. Since the person who is eating grapes is in House 4, the flutist must be in House 5.

The person who is eating apples cannot be in House 2 (Clue 3) or House 4 (Clue 13), so the person who is eating apples must be in House 1, House 3, or House 5. Since the flutist is in House 5, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 or House 3. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in House 3 (Clue 14), the person who is eating apples must be in House 1.

6. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the second house has a bouquet of daffodils. From clue 6, the third house has loafers. From clue 2 and 4, the yellow lover cannot be in the first or third house, so the yellow lover must be in the second house. But the second house already has daffodils, so the yellow lover must be in the first house.

Now, the first house has yellow and the second house has daffodils. From clue 7, the yellow lover (first house) and the boots wearer (second or third house) are next to each other, so the boots wearer must be in the second house.

From clue 1, the blue lover lives to the right of the high heels wearer. Since the boots wearer is in the second house, the blue lover must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the lilies lover lives to the right of the science fiction book lover. Since the blue lover is in the third house, the lilies lover must be in the third house. This means the science fiction book lover is in the first house.

From clue 4, the yellow lover (first house) is not the science fiction book lover, so the science fiction book lover must be in the first house, and the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 3, the daffodils lover (second house) is not the history book buff, so the history book buff must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the lilies lover (third house) is to the right of the science fiction book lover (first house), and the science fiction book lover is in the first house, so the lilies lover is in the third house.

From clue 8, the boots wearer (second house) and the yellow lover (first house) are next to each other, and the boots wearer is in the second house, so the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 2, the green lover cannot be in the first house, and from clue 3, the daffodils lover is in the second house, so the green lover must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."

8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
10. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

From clue 1, we know the root beer lover is in house 3.

From clue 2, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan are next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the only way for them to be next to each other is if the person who only drinks water is in house 2 and the person who drives a minivan is in house 1, or vice versa.

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house, so the person who only drinks water must be in house 2 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 1.

From clue 4, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 1, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 1 or 2. But since the person who only drinks water is in house 2, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 1.

From clue 5, the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house, which we already know is true.

From clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. So, the cellist must be in house 1 and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house, so the carnations must be in house 1, 2, or 1 and 2. Since the cellist is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 2.

From clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, the person who is eating apples must be in house 1 and the violinist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist, which is consistent with our previous findings.

So, the violinist lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
4. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
11. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
13. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
14. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
15. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
16. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
17. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
19. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

From clue 12, we know the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. From clue 17, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house. From clue 1, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 5, the person who likes white does not live in the second house, so it must be in the first, fourth, or fifth house. Since the fourth house is taken by the person who likes blue, the person who likes white must live in the first or fifth house. But the fifth house is taken by the person who ate grilled cheese, so the person who likes white must live in the first house.

Now, let's place the person who is wearing high heels in the second house and the person who likes yellow in the third house. The person who likes white lives in the first house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

From clue 18, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house. But the first, second, and fourth houses are taken, so the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house. This is a contradiction because the fifth house is taken by the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

Now, the first house is taken by the person who likes white, the second house by the person who is wearing high heels, the third house by the person who likes yellow, the fourth house by the person who likes blue, and the fifth house by the person who ate grilled cheese. The person who is wearing loafers must live in the fourth house because there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives, and the only house left is the fourth house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the person with a television lives in the first house.
2. The person with lilies does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.
3. Since the person with lilies is in the second house, the person with roses must be in the first house.
4. The person with a television is in the first house, so the person with a computer must be in the second house.

So, the person with a computer lives in the second house. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils.

From clue 1, we can say:
- The science fiction book fanatic is in house 1 and the golfer is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the golfer is in house 2, the pizza eater and history book buff must be in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the golfer is in house 2, the person with daffodils must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Daffodils, Pizza, History book
- House 2: Tulips, Golf, Science fiction, Guitar

The only person left is the percussionist, and they must be in house 1.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The violinist lives in the fourth house.
2. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.
3. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
4. The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
6. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
8. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
9. There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.
10. The dog owner does not live in the second house.

From clue 8 and 6, we know the guitarist is to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the fourth house, the percussionist cannot be in the fourth or fifth house. So, the percussionist must be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 7, the person with the television is to the left of the gameboy. Since the bird keeper is in the fifth house, the gameboy cannot be in the fifth house. The television must be in the third or fourth house, but the fourth house is occupied by the violinist. So, the television is in the third house, and the gameboy is in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the flutist is to the left of the television. So, the flutist is in the second house.

From clue 9, the phone and the horses are two houses apart. Since the flutist is in the second house and the television is in the third house, the horses must be in the first house, and the phone in the fifth house. But the bird keeper is in the fifth house, so the phone must be in the first house, and the horses in the second house.

From clue 3, the fish and horses are next to each other, and from clue 9, the horses are in the second house, so the fish must be in the first house.

From clue 10, the dog owner does not live in the second house, so the dog owner must be in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the first house is the phone, the third house is the television, and the fifth house is the bird keeper, the dog owner must be in the third house.

So, the percussionist must be in the first house.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with lilies lives in the first house (Clue 3).
2. The basketball player does not live in the first house (Clue 4), so the basketball player must live in the second house.
3. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person eating apples (Clue 1), and also to the right of the violinist (Clue 2). Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person with the radio must be the basketball player.
4. So, the basketball player (who has the radio) lives in the second house, and the person with lilies lives in the first house.

Now, we need to figure out who lives where:
- The first house has lilies and is not the basketball player, so it must be the person eating apples.
- The second house has a radio and is the basketball player, so it must be eating oranges.

The violinist cannot be in the first house (because the first house has lilies) and cannot be in the second house (because the second house has a radio). Therefore, the violinist must live in the first house.

So, the number of the house where the violinist lives is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 3: Tennis player

From clue 2, we know:
- House 5: Grilled cheese

From clue 3, we know:
- House 4: Golfer

From clue 7, we know:
- The tennis player (House 3) is to the left of the soccer player, so the soccer player must be in House 4 or 5. But House 4 is already taken by the golfer, so the soccer player must be in House 5. This is a contradiction, so let's recheck the clues and adjust.

From clue 6, we know:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, if the person who ate spaghetti is in House 5, the person who had stew must be in House 4. But House 4 is already taken by the golfer, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 5, and the person who had stew must be in House 4.

From clue 4, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 5, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player and House 4 by the golfer, the person who had pizza must be in House 1 or 2. The cricketer must be in House 2 or 3, but House 3 is taken by the tennis player, so the cricketer must be in House 2.

So, the cricketer lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. So, the person wearing running shoes must live in the second house.

2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and the person who likes white lives in house 1.

3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.

4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

Now, let's put the information together:
- House 1: The person who likes white, drinks water, and is a baseball player.
- House 2: The person who ate spaghetti and drinks milk.

The only thing left to figure out is the sport of the person in house 2. Since the person in house 1 is a baseball player, the person in house 2 must be a swimmer.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover cannot be in the second house. So, the root beer lover must be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 4, the person eating oranges cannot be in the second house. So, the person eating oranges must be in either the first or the third house.

Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house, and the person eating oranges cannot be in the second house, the second house must be occupied by the person eating grapes.

Now, let's use clue 2: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (because then there would be no house to the right for the water drinker). So, the root beer lover must be in the first house.

If the root beer lover is in the first house, then the water drinker must be in the third house (since the second house is for grapes and the water drinker must be to the right of the root beer lover).

This leaves the second house for the person eating oranges.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Not fried rice

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice is in House 3, because the person who is wearing boots is in House 2 (directly left of House 3).

From clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Not loafers (since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 1)

So, the only place left for the person wearing loafers is House 2.

From clue 1, we know the dog owner is in house 3.

From clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 1 or 2 (since the dog owner is in house 3).

From clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who is wearing boots must be in house 4 or 5.

From clue 13, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes milk. So, if the person who only drinks water is in house 1, the person who likes milk is in house 2. If the person who only drinks water is in house 2, the person who likes milk is in house 3, but the dog owner is in house 3, so this is not possible.

From clue 9, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the bird keeper. So, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 1.

From clue 10, the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers. So, the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, and the bird keeper is in house 1.

So, if the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 3. If the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 4.

But the dog owner is in house 3, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 3.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives. So, if the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 3, the person who owns horses is in house 2.

From clue 2, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1, and the cat lover must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives in the fifth house. So, the root beer lover is in house 5.

From clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. So, if the person who only drinks water is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots is in house 4. If the person who only drinks water is in house 2, the person who is wearing boots is in house 5, but the root beer lover is in house 5, so this is not possible.

So, the person who only drinks water is in house 1, the person who likes milk is in house 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1, the cat lover is in house 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the person who owns horses is in house 3, the person who is wearing sandals is in house 5, the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 2, the coffee drinker is in house 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 4.

From clue 4, the person wearing running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. So, the person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 1 or 2 (because there would be no house to the left for running shoes). This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 3, and the person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 3, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 (but we already know house 2 is running shoes, so this is consistent).

From clue 3, the person with a rose bouquet does not live in the first house. So, the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, 3, or 4. But house 2 is running shoes, and house 4 is loafers, so the person with a rose bouquet is in house 3.

From clue 8, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the violinist. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 3, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 (loafers), and the violinist is in house 3.

From clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist. So, the guitarist is in house 4, and the violinist is in house 3.

From clue 6, the person who likes white lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes. So, the person who likes white is in house 3 or 4. But the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 3, so the person who likes white is in house 4.

From clue 9, there are two houses between the person who likes green and the pianist. Since the person who likes white is in house 4, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or 2. The person who likes green is to the left of the pianist, so the pianist is in house 3 or 4. Since the person who likes white is in house 4, the pianist is in house 3, and the person who likes green is in house 1.

From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza is in house 3, the person who likes blue is in house 1 or 2. The person who likes green is in house 1, so the person who likes blue is in house 2.

So, the person who likes white is in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."

- Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, we can write:
  House 1: ?
  House 2: Blue
  House 3: ?

- The cricketer is to the right of the person eating oranges, so the cricketer can't be in House 1. Also, the baseball player is to the left of the cat lover, so the cat lover can't be in House 1. This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1.

- The person eating grapes is to the right of the basketball player, so the basketball player can't be in House 3. This means the basketball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.

- The person who likes blue is in House 2, so the person eating grapes must be in House 2.

- The person wearing loafers is to the right of the person eating grapes, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- The dog owner is to the left of the person who likes green, so the dog owner can't be in House 3. This means the dog owner must be in House 1 or House 2. But since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the dog owner must be in House 1.

- The person who likes green is in House 2, and the person wearing sandals is to the right of the dog owner, so the person wearing sandals must be in House 3.

- The cricketer is to the right of the person eating oranges, so the cricketer must be in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Person who likes green
- House 3: Cricketer

Now, we need to match the sports and fruits:
- The cricketer is in House 3, so the cricketer is eating mangos.
- The person eating grapes is in House 2, so the person eating grapes is a basketball player.
- The person eating oranges is in House 1, so the person eating oranges is a baseball player.

Finally, we need to match the pets and shoes:
- The dog owner is in House 1, so the dog owner is a dog owner.
- The person who likes green is in House 2, so the person who likes green is a bird keeper.
- The cricketer is in House 3, so the cricketer is a cat lover.

    - If the person who ate fried rice is in House 3, the person who had stew must be in House 4 or 5.

From the clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Horses
- House 2: Root Beer
- House 3: Grilled Cheese
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Coffee

Since the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1 (because the horse owner is there), the bird keeper must be in House 5, and the tennis player must be in House 4. But House 4 is already occupied by the cricketer, so the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the tennis player must be in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is **(B) 2**."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
4. The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.

7. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
8. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.

11. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the fifth house.
12. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. So, house 5 is blue.

From clue 13, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader are two houses apart. Since the romance book lover can't be in house 5, let's try house 1 for the romance book lover and house 3 for the mystery book reader. This fits clue 13.

From clue 10, there is one house between the romance book lover and the tennis player. If the romance book lover is in house 1, the tennis player must be in house 3. But house 3 is already taken by the mystery book reader, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the tennis player in house 4.

From clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. So, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3, and the tennis player in house 4.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. So, the person eating mangos must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 3 is taken by the kiwi eater, so the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. So, the person who likes green must be in house 3.

From clue 8, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. So, the cricketer must be in house 1, and the person who likes white in house 2.

From clue 9, the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. The only houses left are 2 and 4. Since the person who likes white is in house 2, the golfer must be in house 2, and the science fiction book fanatic in house 4.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. So, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 3.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. So, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader in house 2.

So, the history book buff must be in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the cellist lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

2. The dog owner does not live in the first house. So, the dog owner must live in the second house.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person with a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person with a phone lives directly left of the person with an SUV. This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be in houses 2 and 3, or houses 3 and 4, but not in the first house because the minivan is there.
4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a gameboy, so the radio person must be in house 4.
5. The person with a convertible does not live in the third house, so the convertible must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
6. The person with a computer does not live in the first house, so the computer must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's put the clues together:
- House 1: minivan
- House 2: must be phone or SUV (because the person with a phone is directly left of the SUV)
- House 3: gameboy
- House 4: radio

Since the person with a phone is directly left of the SUV, and the gameboy is in house 3, the phone must be in house 2 and the SUV must be in house 4.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with the vase of tulips lives in the third house.
2. The person with the phone lives directly left of the person with the television. So, if the person with the phone is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 3. But the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3, so the person with the phone can't be in house 2. If the person with the phone is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 2. This means the person with the vase of tulips can't be in house 2 either.
3. The person with the computer lives in the second house. So, the person with the phone can't be in house 2 because the computer is there.
4. The person with the bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person with the radio and does not live in the fourth house. This means the person with the radio must be in house 3 or 4, and the person with the daffodils must be in house 4 or 5.
5. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person with the phone. So, if the person with the phone is in house 1, the person with the lilies must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the person with the phone can't be in house 1 because the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.
6. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. This means the person with the carnations can't be in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet can't be in house 5.

Now, let's put the clues together:
- The person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.
- The person with the computer is in house 2.
- The person with the phone can't be in house 1 or 2, so it must be in house 4.
- The person with the television is in house 5.
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils can't be in house 4, so it must be in house 5, but the television is already there, so it must be in house 4.
- The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with the phone, so it must be in house 5.
- The person with the radio must be in house 3 because the person with the bouquet of daffodils can't be there.
- The person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, and the person with the carnations is in house 1.

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

From clues 1 and 5, we know:
- The cricketer lives in the second house.
- The fish enthusiast also lives in the second house.

This means the second house is occupied by both the cricketer and the fish enthusiast, which is not possible. So, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 6, the bird keeper lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the bird keeper.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer is in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first or third house. But the first house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the bird keeper is in the first house, the person who is wearing sandals must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals is in the third house, the tennis player must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the bird keeper, so the tennis player must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. But we already placed the cricketer in the second house, so we need to re-evaluate. The fish enthusiast must be in the third house, and the cricketer must be in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the golfer lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the golfer.

From clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the cat lover must be in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first, second, third, or fifth house. But the first house is occupied by the bird keeper, the second house is occupied by the cricketer, the third house is occupied by the fish enthusiast, and the fifth house is occupied by the cat lover. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate. The person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first, second, or third house. But the first house is occupied by the bird keeper, the second house is occupied by the cricketer, and the third house is occupied by the fish enthusiast. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in the first house, the person who owns horses must be in the second or third house. But the second house is occupied by the cricketer, so the person who owns horses must be in the third house. The person who is wearing boots must be in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals is in the third house, the baseball player must be in the fourth or fifth house. But the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the baseball player must be in the fifth house.

So, the dog owner must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (E) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with the radio and the person with the truck live next to each other.
2. The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 2.

From clue 4, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer. So, the person eating grapes must be in house 1 and the person with the computer must be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the person with the computer is also in house 2, the root beer lover cannot be the person with the computer.

From clue 2, the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with the radio and the person with the truck are next to each other, and the person with the radio must be in house 1 (because the person with the computer is in house 2), the person with the truck must be in house 2.

So, the person with the radio is in house 1, and the person with the truck is in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Radio, Grapes
- House 2: Truck, Computer

The root beer lover is in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
7. The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker

From clue 5, we know:
- House 2: Pizza

From clue 7, we know:
- Green does not live in House 1 or House 2.

From clue 8, we know:
- Grilled cheese does not live in House 1.

From clue 2, we know:
- Milk lives to the left of spaghetti, so milk can be in House 1 or House 2, but since House 1 is the tea drinker, milk must be in House 2.

From clue 6, we know:
- Spaghetti lives to the left of water, so water must be in House 3 or House 4, and spaghetti must be in House 2 or House 1. But since House 1 is the tea drinker and House 2 is milk, spaghetti must be in House 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- White and water live next to each other, so they must be in House 3 and House 4. Since spaghetti is in House 3, water must be in House 4 and white in House 3.

From clue 3, we know:
- Coffee lives to the left of yellow, so coffee must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 is the tea drinker and House 2 is milk, coffee must be in House 2 and yellow in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Milk
- House 3: Coffee, Yellow
- House 4: Water, White

The only house left for green is House 4.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The dog owner lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.
3. The dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
7. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
8. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
9. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
10. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
11. The person who likes white lives in the third house.
12. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clues 1, 3, and 8, we know:
- The dog owner lives in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the third house.

Since the dog owner and the person who likes white both live in the third house, this means the third house is the dog owner's house and the person who likes white.

From clue 12, the fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the dog owner is in the third house, the person who likes red cannot be in the third house. Also, the SUV cannot be in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the minivan and sandals cannot be in the same house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. So, the person who is wearing loafers can be in the second or fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the root beer lover cannot be in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. This means the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. This means the SUV cannot be in the first or second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Dog owner (who likes white)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (owns horses)

Since the person who likes red cannot be in the third house and there is one house between the person who likes red and the person who owns an SUV, the person who likes red must be in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth house.

So, the person who likes red lives in the second house.

Now, let's place the known information:

- House 4: Baseball player
- House 3: Running shoes
- House 2: Coffee drinker (since the coffee drinker is directly left of the person wearing sandals)
- House 1: Sandals (since the coffee drinker is in house 2)

Now, we need to place the remaining people and their characteristics:

- House 5: Since the baseball player is in house 4, the golfer must be in house 6 (but there is no house 6, so it must be house 5).
- House 1: Coffee drinker (from the previous deduction)
- House 2: Sandals
- House 3: Running shoes
- House 4: Baseball player
- House 5: Golfer

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer, so the swimmer is in house 4, but house 4 is already occupied by the baseball player. So, the swimmer must be in house 3, and the golfer in house 4.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes, so the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 2, and the person eating grapes is in house 3.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet, and there is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and there is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

- The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, and the person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The soccer player lives in the third house. So, the soccer player is in house 3.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. So, the vase of tulips must be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's put the clues together:
- Since the soccer player is in house 3, the golfer and basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2.
- The golfer is left of the basketball player, so the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.
- The person with lilies is left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who ate grilled cheese is left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since house 3 is the soccer player and house 1 is the golfer).

6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Now, let's try to place things in the houses:

- From clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 3.
- From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 2, 3, or 4.
- From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water are next to each other. So, they can be in (1,2), (2,3), or (3,4).

Let's use clue 5: the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. So, the person with running shoes can be in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3.

Let's use clue 2: the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, if the person who had stew is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4. But the tea drinker is in house 3, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

Now, let's use clue 4: the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, if the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 or 4. But the tea drinker is in house 3, so the person who only drinks water must be in house 4.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Running shoes (because it's to the left of stew)
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea
- House 4: Water and Spaghetti

The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water are next to each other, so they must be in house 3 and 4. But we already know house 4 is water, so the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

10. The cricketer lives in the third house.
11. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
12. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 5, we know the radio is in the third house. From clue 7, the soccer player and the person with the computer are next to each other. Since the radio is in the third house, the soccer player and the computer must be in the second and fourth houses, or the first and third houses. But the basketball player is in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the second house and the computer in the third house.

From clue 3, the person with boots lives directly left of the person with the computer. So, the person with boots must be in the second house. This means the soccer player is in the second house and the computer is in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. So, the computer is in the third house, and the person with loafers is in the third house.

From clue 11, the cricketer lives in the third house. So, the cricketer is in the third house, and the computer is in the third house.

From clue 2, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. From clue 9, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. So, the milk drinker and the high heel wearer must be in the first and second houses. Since the second house is the soccer player and the computer, the first house must be the milk drinker and the high heel wearer.

From clue 6, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is the basketball player.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker must be in the first house, and the milk drinker in the second house.

From clue 8, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the radio is in the third house, the root beer lover must be in the first or second house. But the first house is the milk drinker, so the root beer lover must be in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer. So, the boots wearer is in the second house, and the computer is in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. So, the spaghetti eater is in the first or second house, and the stew eater is in the second or third house. Since the second house is the soccer player and the computer, the first house must be the spaghetti eater, and the second house the stew eater.

From clue 7, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. So, the soccer player is in the second house, and the computer is in the third house.

So, the computer is in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (number 1) and one on the right (number 2).
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Now, let's use the clue:
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house number 2 because there is no house to the right of house 2. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The pianist lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses (Clue 2). This means the person who owns horses cannot live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house (Clue 3). Since the root beer lover lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

Now, we know:
- The first house is the pianist's house and the root beer lover's house.
- The second house is the person who owns horses.

Since the first house is the pianist's and the root beer lover's house, the second house must be the dog owner's and the person who likes white's house.

So, the dog owner lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
2. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
3. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
4. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
5. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
6. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
7. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 3, we know:
- Fried rice and fantasy book enthusiast are 2 houses apart.

From clue 4, we know:
- The percussionist is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 5, we know:
- The guitarist is to the left of the violinist.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff is to the right of the percussionist.

From clue 7, we know:
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house, so the violinist must live in house 1 or 3.

Let's place the percussionist and science fiction book fanatic:
- If the percussionist is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 (which is not possible since the percussionist is to the right).
- If the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.
- If the percussionist is in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 2.
- If the percussionist is in house 4, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the violinist cannot be in house 4).

So, the percussionist must be in house 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 2: Stew (science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: (percussionist)
- House 4: Pizza (violinist)

This leaves house 1 for the history book buff and fried rice, and house 3 for the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist.

So, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: White

From clue 4, since the person who likes white (House 1) and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

From clue 7, the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2) live next to each other, so the person who owns horses must be in House 3.

From clue 6, the dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses, so the dog owner must be in House 3 (since House 3 is the only house to the right of House 2).

From clue 3, the bird keeper does not live in the third house, so the bird keeper must be in House 1.

From clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the bird keeper (House 1) likes green, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house, so the person who is wearing boots must be in House 3.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2) live next to each other, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Green, Sandals, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: White, Daffodils
- House 3: Yellow, Boots, Horses

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

- The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.

Let's put this all together:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: (Not boots, as per clue 5)

Since the person who has a vase of tulips is to the left of the person who likes red, and the person who likes white is directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips, we can deduce:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, not white (since white is to the left of tulips)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, not white (since white is to the left of tulips)
- House 3: Not boots (since boots are not in the third house)

Since the person who has a vase of tulips is to the left of the person who likes red, and the person who likes white is directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips, the only place for the vase of tulips is in the first house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house (Clue 4).
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 3). Since the lilies are in the second house, the tulips must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tulips, Water

The only flower left is the rose bouquet, and it must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 3.

11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is a tennis player.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who is wearing loafers.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the first house is occupied by the person who is wearing loafers, the cricketer must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house. But we already know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is a tennis player. So, the cricketer cannot live in the second house. This means the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house.

From clue 11, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the cricketer is in the fourth house, the swimmer must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the person who is wearing loafers, so the swimmer must be in the second house. The person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the swimmer and the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the swimmer and the person who has a gameboy, the person who has a phone must live in the first or fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the fourth house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the third house.

"The person who likes yellow lives in house number 1.

Here's how we can figure this out:

1. From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
2. Clue 2 tells us that the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Since there are only three houses, the only way this can happen is if the romance book lover lives in house 1 and the history book buff lives in house 2.
3. Clue 1 says the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff lives in house 2, the person who likes green must live in house 1. But we already know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, so the person who likes green must live in house 2.
4. Clue 3 says the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the romance book lover lives in house 1, the person who had pizza must live in either house 2 or 3.
5. Clue 5 says the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in house 1, the person who ate fried rice must live in either house 2 or 3.

From the above, we can conclude:
- House 1: The person who likes yellow (from clue 4).
- House 2: The person who likes green (from clue 1 and clue 2).
- House 3: The person who ate fried rice (from clue 5).

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house number 1."

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know the golfer cannot be in house 2. So, the golfer must be in either house 1 or house 3.

From clue 5, the person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, because then there would be no house to the right for the radio.

So, the television must be in house 1 or house 2. If the television is in house 1, the radio must be in house 2. But this would mean the golfer cannot be in house 2 (clue 2), so the television cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the television must be in house 2, and the radio must be in house 3.

Now, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with the television. Since the television is in house 2, the tennis player must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the person with the computer and the person with the vase of tulips live next to each other. Since the tennis player is in house 1, the computer and vase of tulips must be in house 2 and 3, but we already know house 2 has the television and house 3 has the radio.

From clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives directly right of the person with running shoes. So, the person with running shoes must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the cricketer lives in the fourth house. So, the cricketer is the one with running shoes.

From clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the cricketer is in the fourth house, the baseball player and the basketball player must be in the third and fifth houses or the first and second houses. But the fifth house is already taken by the daffodils, so they must be in the first and second houses.

From clue 5, the violinist lives in the second house. So, the second house is the violinist.

From clue 6, the basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist. So, the basketball player must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the person with sandals lives directly left of the person with tulips. So, the person with sandals must be in the first house, and the person with tulips must be in the second house. But the second house is the violinist, so the person with sandals must be in the first house, and the person with tulips must be in the second house.

From clue 8, the person with loafers lives directly left of the percussionist. So, the person with loafers must be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in the second house. But the second house is the violinist, so the person with loafers must be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in the second house.

From clue 2, the person with carnations lives to the right of the guitarist. So, the person with carnations must be in the third house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

12. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

From clue 7, the romance book lover is in the fifth house, so the vase of tulips must be in the third or fourth house (one house away).

From clue 13, the person who owns horses is in the second house. So, the dog owner must be in the third house (since the fantasy book enthusiast is directly left of the dog owner).

From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the horse owner is in the second house, the white lover must be in the first house.

From clue 3, the yellow lover lives to the left of the lilies. Since the white lover is in the first house, the yellow lover must be in the second house, but that's not possible because the horse owner is there. So, the yellow lover must be in the first house, and the lilies must be in the second house.

From clue 10, the lilies are to the left of the bird keeper. So, the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the blue lover and the history book buff are next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the fourth house, the blue lover and the history book buff must be in the third and fourth houses, but the third house is the horse owner, so the blue lover and the history book buff must be in the fourth and fifth houses. The history book buff is in the fifth house, and the blue lover is in the fourth house.

From clue 12, the mystery book reader is directly left of the blue lover. So, the mystery book reader is in the third house, and the blue lover is in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the red lover and the romance book lover are next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the fifth house, the red lover must be in the fourth house, but the fourth house is the blue lover. So, the red lover must be in the third house, and the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 9, the daffodils and the yellow lover are next to each other. So, the daffodils must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the rose bouquet is to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clues 2, 4, and 6, we know:
- The flutist lives in the third house.
- The person with a phone lives in the third house.
- The person with running shoes lives in the third house.

This means the third house is occupied by the flutist, the person with a phone, and the person with running shoes. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

Since the flutist lives in the third house, the person with a phone and the person with running shoes must live in the first and second houses or the second and fourth houses. But clue 15 tells us that the science fiction book fanatic and the person with running shoes live next to each other. So, the person with running shoes must be in the second house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

Now, the third house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, and the first house must be occupied by the flutist. The second house is occupied by the person with a phone.

From clue 5,"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, the percussionist and the romance book lover must be in the third and second houses, respectively.

From clue 1, the romance book lover is to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, the history book buff and the guitarist must be in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses. But the second house is already taken by the romance book lover, so the history book buff must be in the first house and the guitarist in the third house.

From clue 3, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. We already know the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this is consistent.

From clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. From clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, so the violinist must be in the third house.

So, the violinist lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with the television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person with loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person with the phone does not live in the second house, so the phone must be in either the first, third, or fourth house.
4. The person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person with loafers, so the person with boots must live in the first or third house.
5. There are two houses between where the person with a radio lives and where the person with sandals lives.

Now, let's place the information we know:

- House 4: Television
- House 2: Loafers

Since the person with boots must be to the left of the person with loafers, the person with boots can only be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's try House 1 for boots:

- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: (We need to place the radio or sandals)
- House 4: Television

Since there are two houses between the radio and sandals, and the radio can't be in House 4 (because House 4 has the television), the radio must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already boots, so the radio must be in House 3.

- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television

Now, the sandals must be in House 2 (because there are two houses between the radio and sandals).

- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Sandals
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television

The only device left is the gameboy, and the only house left is House 1.

So, the person with the gameboy lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. So the answer is (B) 2.
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house. So, the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the person in the second house is wearing loafers, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

3. If the mystery book reader lives in the first house, then the person in the second house must be the history book buff.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

9. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza is in house 2 and the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 1 and the person who had pizza is in house 2.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing boots is in house 1.

From clue 7, the person who has a television is in house 1 and the person who has a radio is in house 2.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1 and the person who had stew is in house 2.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes (house 1) and the person who has a gameboy (house 2) live next to each other, which is consistent.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes (house 1) does not live in the third house, which is also consistent.

From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (house 3), so the person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 1.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing running shoes (house 1) and the person who has a rose bouquet (house 2) live next to each other, which is consistent.

From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti is in house 1 and the person who has a radio is in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots, Carnations, Spaghetti, Television
- House 2: High Heels, Tulips, Pizza, Radio
- House 3: Sandals, Daffodils, Stew, Gameboy
- House 4: Running Shoes, Rose Bouquet, Stew, Phone

The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house. So, the saxophonist must live in the second house.
3. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house. So, the person in the first house is eating mangos and has a rose bouquet.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

So, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 15, we know the radio is in house 1. From Clue 5, the coffee drinker is in house 4. Let's place the other clues in order:

- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone (Clue 1). So, if the person who likes green is in house 2, the person who has a phone is in house 3.
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible (Clue 2). So, the person who drives a convertible must be in house 1 (but we already know house 1 has the radio, so this is not possible). Let's try house 2 for the person who likes green, then the person who drives a convertible must be in house 1.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house. So, tulips can only be in house 1 or 2.
2. The SUV owner lives directly left of the lilies owner. This means if lilies are in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2. If lilies are in house 2, the SUV must be in house 1.
3. The sedan and rose bouquet live next to each other, and the rose bouquet can't be in house 2. So, the rose bouquet must be in house 1 or 3.
4. If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the sedan must be in house 2. But then the SUV can't fit in house 2 because it needs to be left of the lilies. So, the rose bouquet can't be in house 1.
5. Therefore, the rose bouquet must be in house 3. This means the sedan must be in house 2.
6. Since the SUV can't be in house 2, it must be in house 1. This leaves the truck for house 3.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

   - Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in the third house (since the fantasy book enthusiast must be to the right of them).

   - Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in either the first or the third house.

But the third house is yellow, so the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other.

This means the first house is the person who owns horses and likes blue.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. Since the person who owns horses and likes blue is in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. Since the second house is the person who owns a sedan, the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in the first and third houses or the third and first houses.

12. The guitarist does not live in the third house.
13. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
14. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
15. The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.
16. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

From clue 16, we know the first house has carnations. From clue 1, the third house has apples. From clue 4, the fourth house has fried rice. From clue 10, the person with daffodils lives directly left of the person with a rose bouquet. So, if the person with a rose bouquet is in the fifth house, the person with daffodils must be in the fourth house, but we already know the fourth house has fried rice. Therefore, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the fifth house, and the person with daffodils must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since the fourth house has fried rice, the third and fifth houses cannot have stew or grilled cheese. So, the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses must have stew and grilled cheese. But the third house has apples, so the second and third houses cannot have stew or grilled cheese. Therefore, the third and fourth houses must have stew and grilled cheese. Since the third house has apples, the fourth house must have grilled cheese, and the second house must have stew.

From clue 9, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the percussionist. So, the percussionist must be in the first house. From clue 11, there are two houses between the person who is eating a banana and the pianist. Since the first house has the percussionist, the second house has stew, and the third house has apples, the pianist must be in the fifth house. So, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the third house has apples, the fourth house has daffodils.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. So, the vase of tulips must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house. Since the first house has carnations, the second house has stew, the fourth house has daffodils, and the fifth house has a rose bouquet, the vase of tulips must be in the fifth house.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since the fifth house has a rose bouquet and the vase of tulips, the saxophonist must be in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza must be in the fifth house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. So, if the guitarist is in house 1, the vase of tulips is in house 2; if the guitarist is in house 2, the vase of tulips is in house 3; if the guitarist is in house 3, the vase of tulips is in house 4. But since the history book buff is in house 2 and the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the only possible placement for the guitarist is in house 3, and the vase of tulips is in house 4.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives (house 2) and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.
5. **Clue 11**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the percussionist must live in house 1.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist is in house 1, the person who likes blue must live in house 1.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who had pizza must live in house 2.
8. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives (house 1) and where the person who likes green lives. So, the person who likes green must live in house 4.
9. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes green is in house 4, the person who likes white must live in house 3, and the romance book lover must live in house 4.
10. **Clue 4**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house. Since the romance book lover is in house 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is occupied by the person who likes blue, and house 2 is occupied by the person who had pizza, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in house 3.
11. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1 or 3. But house 1 is occupied by the person who likes blue, and house 3 is occupied by the person who has a carnations arrangement, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1.
12. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1, the flutist must live in house 2, 3, or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the person who had pizza, and house 4 is occupied by the person who likes green, so the flutist must live in house 3.
13. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had pizza is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must live in house 3, which is consistent with our previous findings.
14. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green is in house 4, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 4. But house 3 is occupied by the person who has a carnations arrangement, and house 4 is occupied by the person who likes green, so the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.

So, the cellist lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

From clue 1, we know the pianist and the kiwi-eater are next to each other. From clue 4, we know the violinist and the kiwi-eater are also one house apart. This means the violinist, pianist, and kiwi-eater must be in houses 1, 2, and 3 in some order, but they must be next to each other.

From clue 2, the flutist is to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist cannot be in house 3, because then the flutist would have to be in house 4, which doesn't exist.

So, the only way to fit everyone is if the violinist is in house 1, the flutist is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3. This also fits clue 1 and clue 4.

Now, from clue 3, there is one house between the grape-eater and the kiwi-eater. Since the violinist, pianist, and kiwi-eater are next to each other, the grape-eater must be in house 2, the middle house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Grape-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house number 2.

Here's how we can figure it out:
- We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house."
"The person who likes red lives in the third house.

Here's how we can figure this out:

1. From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
2. From clue 8, the person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. From clue 9, the person who has a radio lives in the third house, which means the person who likes red and has a radio both live in the third house.

So, the answer is (D) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the pianist lives directly left of the cellist. This means the pianist must live in house 1 and the cellist in house 2, or the other way around. But since the root beer lover does not live in the second house, the cellist cannot live in house 2. So, the cellist must live in house 1 and the pianist in house 2.

2. Since the cellist lives in house 1, the root beer lover cannot live there. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in house 2.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.

4. There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know:
- The person with carnations lives in house 5.

From clue 1, since the person with boots and the person with carnations are next to each other, the person with boots must live in house 4.

From clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person with loafers. Since the person with boots is in house 4, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with loafers must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the person with sandals does not live in house 5, so the person with sandals must live in house 1.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. Since the person with sandals is in house 1, the person with running shoes must be in house 3 (but house 3 is already taken by the person with a vase of tulips), so the person with running shoes must be in house 4 (but house 4 is already taken by the person with boots), so the person with running shoes must be in house 2, and the person with lilies must be in house 1.

From clue 5, the person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, the person with daffodils must be in house 1.

From clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house, which is already correct since the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Sandals, Daffodils
- House 2: Running Shoes, Lilies
- House 3: Vase of Tulips, Loafers
- House 4: Boots, Carnations
- House 5: None, Carnations

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 1**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
   - If the blue person is in house 1, the apple person must be in house 4.
   - If the blue person is in house 2, the apple person must be in house 5 (but there are only 4 houses, so this is not possible).
   - If the blue person is in house 3, the apple person must be in house 6 (again, not possible).
   - If the blue person is in house 4, the apple person must be in house 1.
   - So, the blue person and the apple person must be in houses 1 and 4, but we need to check other clues to confirm.

2. **Clue 2**: The baseball player does not live in the second house.
   - This means the baseball player can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the white person must be in a house to the left of the water person.

4. **Clue 4**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the swimmer must be in a house to the left of the water person.

   - If the blue person is in house 3, the orange person must be in house 1.
   - If the blue person is in house 4, the orange person must be in house 2.

9. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.
   - This means the white and tea drinker must be in houses that are two apart.

10. **Clue 10**: The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
    - This means the white person and the swimmer must be in adjacent houses.

11. **Clue 11**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
    - This means the pianist must be in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

12. **Clue 12**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
    - This means the blue person must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

By analyzing all the clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Pianist, likes white, drinks water, eats grapes, is a swimmer
- House 2: Saxophonist, likes blue, drinks coffee, eats oranges, is a tennis player
- House 3: Violinist, likes green, drinks milk, eats apples, is a baseball player
- House 4: Percussionist, likes red, drinks tea, eats bananas, is a golfer

So, the pianist lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes red must live in the third house because the first two houses are taken by white and green.

4. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first or second house. But since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who likes red must be wearing high heels and live in the second house.

5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house, which is correct because we already placed stew in the third house.

8. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the second house is taken by the person who likes green, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

9. The person who ate stew must have eaten something different from spaghetti and fried rice. So, the person who ate stew must have had stew.

10. The person who ate fried rice must live in the second house because the first house has spaghetti and the third house has stew.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.
2. The person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first or third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the first house, because there's no house to the left of it. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.
4. This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
5. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. So, the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in the second and third houses, but the third house is already taken by the science fiction book fanatic. So, the romance book lover must be in the second house and the vase of tulips in the third house.
6. Now, we know:
   - House 1: Fantasy book
   - House 2: Rose bouquet
   - House 3: Romance book
   - House 4: ?

7. The only flower left is lilies, and the only book left is mystery. So, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the fourth house.

So, the answer is (C) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since House 1 is on the left and House 2 is on the right, the coffee drinker must live in House 1 and the person wearing sandals must live in House 2.
3. This means the person in House 2 is the water drinker (since the coffee drinker is in House 1).

So, the person in House 1 is the science fiction book fanatic and the coffee drinker.
The person in House 2 is the romance book lover and the water drinker.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The clue tells us that the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

So, if the percussionist is in House 1 and the person with the radio is in House 2, then the percussionist is in House 1 and the person with the phone must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan can't live in the same house or the second house (since there's a house in between).

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the person who likes yellow lives in a house to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Now, let's put this all together:

- The second house has a convertible.
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
- There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan.

If we start with the second house having a convertible, the only way to fit the other clues is:

- The first house can't have the person who likes white or the person who owns a sedan because there needs to be one house in between.
- The third house can't have the person who likes yellow because the person who likes yellow must be to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

So, the only place left for the person who likes yellow is the first house.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house number 1.

From clue 12, we know:
- The dog owner does not live in the first house, which we already know is true.

From clue 7, we know:

From clue 13, we know:
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the minivan must be in the second house (loafers), the horses must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is for the sedan, so the horses must be in the fourth house.

2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the second house is the one with kiwis, the first house must be the one with grapes. So, the person in the first house is wearing sandals and likes yellow.

3. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the first house is the one with grapes and the person there likes yellow and wears sandals, the second house must be the one where the person who only drinks water lives.

2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, this means one of them must be in house 1 and the other in house 2.

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels is to the left of the person wearing sandals. So, if the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

This means:
- House 1: Wearing high heels
- House 2: Wearing sandals

From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television. Since the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the person wearing high heels is in house 1), the person with a television must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Wearing high heels, Tea drinker
- House 2: Wearing sandals, Television

From clue 2, the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Wearing high heels, Tea drinker, Eating grapes
- House 2: Wearing sandals, Television

The only fruit left is kiwis, and it must be in house 2.

So, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 3).
2. The violinist does not live in the third house (Clue 4), so the violinist must live in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives (Clue 2). Since the violinist is in the second house, the guitarist must be in the third house.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist (Clue 1). Since the guitarist is in the third house, the cellist must be in the first house, and the water drinker must be in the second house.

So, the guitarist lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From clue 1 and 3, we know:
- Sandals are in house 3.
- Water is in house 4.

From clue 7, we know:
- Milk is in house 3.

So, house 3 is occupied by the person wearing sandals and the person who likes milk.

From clue 4, we know:
- Tea is in house 5.

From clue 6, we know:
- Water is to the left of boots, so boots cannot be in house 4 or 5. This means boots must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 5, we know:
- There is one house between the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers. Since water is in house 4, the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 5 or 1 and 4. But since tea is in house 5, the coffee drinker cannot be in house 5. So, the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person wearing loafers is in house 4.

Since the person wearing loafers is in house 4 and water is in house 4, this is a contradiction. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 and the person wearing loafers in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker
- House 3: Loafers
- House 4: Water
- House 5: Tea drinker

So, the person who only drinks water lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio.
4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between the person who has a gameboy and the person who ate fried rice.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person with a radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8**: The person with a computer does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person with a radio does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 8, we know:
- The person with a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Since the person with a computer and the person with a radio do not live in the fourth house, and the person with a pizza lives in the fourth house, the person with a gameboy and the person with a computer must live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

From Clue 1, the person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other. So, the possible pairs are:
- (1, 2) or (2, 3)

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person with a gameboy and the person who ate fried rice. If the gameboy and computer are in (1, 2), the fried rice person must be in house 3. If the gameboy and computer are in (2, 3), the fried rice person must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti people are in consecutive houses.

From Clue 3, there is one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio. This means the grilled cheese and radio people are in houses 1, 2, or 3, and the radio person is not in house 4.

Let's test the possibilities:

1. If the gameboy and computer are in (1, 2):
   - The fried rice person is in house 3.
   - The grilled cheese and radio people must be in houses 1, 2, or 3, and the radio person is not in house 4.
   - The pizza person is in house 4.
   - The only place for the radio person is house 2, and the grilled cheese person is in house 1.
   - The spaghetti person must be in house 3.

2. If the gameboy and computer are in (2, 3):
   - The fried rice person is in house 1.
   - The grilled cheese and radio people must be in houses 1, 2, or 3, and the radio person is not in house 4.
   - The pizza person is in house 4.
   - The only place for the radio person is house 1, and the grilled cheese person is in house 2.
   - The spaghetti person must be in house 3.

In both scenarios, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

So, the answer is (E) 3."

6. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives. Since the tennis player is in the first house and the percussionist is in the fourth house, the saxophonist and the golfer must be in the second and third houses or the third and fifth houses. But the bird keeper (baseball player) is in the second house, so the saxophonist and the golfer must be in the third and fifth houses.
7. **Clue 11**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. So, the saxophonist must be in the third house and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fourth house.

9. **Clue 15**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the pianist is in the fifth house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 19**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in the fifth house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fifth house. But the pianist is in the fifth house, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the positions:
    - The pianist is in the fifth house.
    - The person who owns horses is in the fourth house.
    - The person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.
11. **Clue 5**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. So, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

    - The person who ate fried rice is in the third house.
13. **Clue 10**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. So, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the bird keeper does not live in the second house because the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper, and the second house is to the right of the first house.

2. So, the bird keeper must live in the first house. This means the percussionist cannot live in the first house, so the percussionist must live in the second house.

3. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house because the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper.

4. This means the person who had pizza must live in the first house because the second house is already taken by the grilled cheese eater.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Cat lover

From clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist, and the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in houses 2 and 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1, and the flutist must be in house 3.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person eating a banana must be in house 1.

From clue 7, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the flutist is in house 3 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2, this is consistent.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2 and the person wearing running shoes is in house 1, this is consistent.

From clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other.
2. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
4. The person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
5. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who is eating grapes is in the second house. So, the layout looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 2, the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. From clue 3, there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. This means the person who likes white and the person who likes red are in houses 1 and 3, or 3 and 1. 

From clue 4, the person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who is eating a banana. This means the person who likes white is in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana is in house 3. So, the layout is:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Banana
- House 4: ?

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. And from clue 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. So, the person who likes green must be in house 2, and the person who likes red must be in house 4. 

So, the final layout is:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Green
- House 3: Banana
- House 4: Red

The person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1, because the person who likes red (house 4) is to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader is on the left, and the cat lover is on the right.

From clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other. Since the mystery book reader is on the left, the person who had stew must be on the right.

6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Loafers

From clue 3, we know:
- Grapes is directly left of Water, so Grapes must be in House 1 and Water in House 2.

From clue 7, we know:
- Kiwis is not in House 1, so Kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.

From clue 3, since Grapes is in House 1 and Water is in House 2, Kiwis must be in House 3.

From clue 5, Kiwis is directly left of Milk, so Milk must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Milk
- House 3: Kiwis

From clue 4, Boots does not live in House 3, so Boots must be in House 1 or 2. But since Loafers are in House 1, Boots must be in House 2.

From clue 6, Boots lives to the right of Gameboy, so Gameboy must be in House 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers, Gameboy
- House 2: Water, Milk, Boots
- House 3: Kiwis

From clue 2, Phone lives to the left of Mangos, so Phone must be in House 1 or 2. Since Gameboy is in House 1, Phone must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers, Gameboy, Phone
- House 2: Water, Milk, Boots, Phone
- House 3: Kiwis

This is not possible because Phone is in both House 1 and House 2. Let's correct this:

- House 1: Grapes, Loafers, Gameboy
- House 2: Water, Milk, Boots, Phone
- House 3: Kiwis

Since Phone is in House 2, Mangos must be in House 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers, Gameboy
- House 2: Water, Milk, Boots, Phone
- House 3: Kiwis, Mangos

So, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. The cricketer does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the golfer and the baseball player are next to each other. From clue 7, the cricketer is not in the third house, so the cricketer must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 1, the golfer is not in house 3, so the golfer must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 4, the person with carnations and the person with horses are next to each other. From clue 5, the person with carnations is to the left of the baseball player. This means the baseball player cannot be in house 1, so the baseball player must be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 6, the person with a rose bouquet is to the left of the person with daffodils. This means the person with daffodils cannot be in house 1.

Let's try to place the people:

- If the cricketer is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the golfer is not in house 3 and the cricketer is not in house 3).
- The baseball player must be in house 3 (since the golfer and baseball player are next to each other and the baseball player cannot be in house 1).

Now, we need to place the sports, flowers, and pets:

- The person with carnations and horses are next to each other, and the person with carnations is to the left of the baseball player. So, the person with carnations must be in house 2, and the person with horses must be in house 3.
- The person with a rose bouquet is to the left of the person with daffodils, so the person with a rose bouquet must be in house 1, and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:

5. The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
6. The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the person with horses lives in the third house. So, the third house is:
- Horse owner
- Eating oranges (from clue 1)

From clue 4, the person eating mangos does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first or second house. But from clue 1, the first house is eating oranges, so the person eating mangos must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person driving a convertible must be in the first house.

From clue 2, the person driving a truck lives directly left of the person driving a convertible. Since the person driving a convertible is in the first house, the person driving a truck must be in the second house.

So, the second house is:
- Driving a truck
- Eating mangos

From clue 3, the bird keeper lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the horse owner is in the third house, the bird keeper and dog owner must be in the first and second houses. We already know the second house is eating mangos, so the first house must be the bird keeper.

Therefore, the person driving a truck lives in the second house.

If the percussionist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 4. If the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1. If the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

From clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader cannot be in house 5, and the percussionist cannot be in house 1.

From clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the mystery book reader and the romance book lover must be in consecutive houses.

If the mystery book reader is in house 3, the history book buff must be in house 5. But the mystery book reader cannot be in house 5, so the mystery book reader must be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. So, if the mystery book reader is in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 3, 4, or 5. If the mystery book reader is in house 3, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 4 or 5.

From clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. So, if the percussionist is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 5. If the percussionist is in house 5, the person who had stew must be in house 6, which is not possible.

From clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. So, if the saxophonist is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. If the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 4 or 5. If the saxophonist is in house 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 5. If the saxophonist is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 5. If the saxophonist is in house 5, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. So, if the percussionist is in house 4, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, 2, or 3. If the percussionist is in house 5, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. So, if the flutist is in house 2, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1.

The grilled cheese eater must be in the second house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

From Clue 18, the apples and yellow are next to each other. From Clue 17, the apples and yellow are next to each other. So, apples and yellow are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the third house, apples and yellow must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 1, the grilled cheese eater is in the second house. From Clue 8, the grilled cheese eater is directly left of the green person, so the green person is in the third house. This means the romance book lover is in the third house, which is correct.

From Clue 15, the apples and minivan are next to each other. Since apples and yellow are in houses 1 and 2, and the minivan is in house 4, the apples must be in house 1 and yellow in house 2.

From Clue 14, the history book buff is not in the fifth house. From Clue 13, the white person is not in the fourth house. So, the white person must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 12, the mangos person is to the right of the SUV. The SUV must be in house 1, and the mangos person is in house 5.

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in house 5.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
2. The cellist does not live in the fifth house.
3. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red.
4. There is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. There are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives.
6. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
8. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
9. The person who likes red does not live in the second house.
10. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house. From clue 10, the person who has a radio lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes green and has a radio.

From clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the third house is taken, the percussionist cannot be in the third house. The only possible positions for the percussionist and the person who likes white are the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is taken, the percussionist and the person who likes white must be in the first and second houses.

From clue 1, the percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. So, the percussionist and the guitarist must be in the first and second houses. This means the percussionist is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who likes red does not live in the second house. Since the second house is the guitarist, the person who likes red cannot be the guitarist. From clue 3, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, the person who has a television must be in the first house, and the person who likes red must be in the second house. But the first house is the percussionist, so the person who has a television must be the percussionist, and the person who likes red must be in the second house, which is the guitarist.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. Since the guitarist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives. Since the percussionist is in the first house, the violinist must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is taken by the person who likes green and has a radio, so the violinist must be in the fourth house. This means the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, and the violinist is in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the cellist does not live in the fifth house. From clue 6, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. Since the third house is taken by the person who likes green and has a radio, and the fourth house is taken by the violinist, the only possible positions for the gameboy and the phone are the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But the first and second houses are taken by the percussionist and the guitarist, so the gameboy and the phone must be in the second and third houses. Since the second house is the guitarist, the gameboy must be in the second house and the phone must be in the third house. But the third house is taken by the person who likes green and has a radio, so the gameboy must be in the first house and the phone must be in the second house.

From clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is the guitarist, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is the percussionist, and the third house is the person who likes green and has a radio, so the person who has a computer must be in the fourth house. This means the person who has a computer is the violinist, and the person who has a phone is the guitarist.

From clue 12, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a computer is in the fourth house and the person who has a phone is in the second house, this is consistent.

So, the saxophonist must be in the fifth house. The answer is (E) 5."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the cellist is on the left and the mystery book reader is on the right. So, the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From clue 2, the history book buff is on the left and the cat lover is on the right. Since the cellist is already in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since the history book buff and the cat lover are already in house 1 and house 2 respectively, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in house 1 and house 2, but we need to figure out who is who.

Since the cellist is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 1 and the guitarist must be in house 2.

So, the person who owns horses is the cat lover, who lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the bird keeper doesn't live in the second house (Clue 2).
2. The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper (Clue 1), so the bird keeper can't live in house 3 (because there's no house to the right of house 3).
3. This means the bird keeper must live in house 1 or house 2.
4. The dog owner doesn't live in house 2 (Clue 2), so the dog owner must live in house 1 or house 3.
5. The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner (Clue 3), so the dog owner can't live in house 3 (because there's no house to the right of house 3).
6. So, the dog owner must live in house 1, and the bird keeper must live in house 2 (because the bird keeper can't live in house 3 and the dog owner can't live in house 2).
7. This means the person with carnations must live in house 3 (because the bird keeper is in house 2 and the carnations must be to the right of the bird keeper).

So, the person with tulips must live in house 2 (because the dog owner is in house 1 and the person with tulips is to the right of the dog owner).

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
3. There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
6. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
8. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
9. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
10. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
11. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.

From clue 1, we know the swimmer is in house 4.

From clue 2, the person eating apples is not in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 3, the person wearing boots and the person eating kiwis are 1 house apart. This means the person wearing boots and the person eating kiwis can be in (1,2), (2,3), or (3,4).

From clue 4, the person wearing high heels is to the left of the person with tulips, and the person with tulips is directly left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer is in house 3, tulips are in house 2, and high heels are in house 1.

From clue 5, the person with a phone is to the left of the person with sandals. This means the person with sandals is in house 3 or 4, and the person with a phone is in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 6, the person eating oranges is to the left of the person with a computer. This means the person with a computer is in house 3 or 4, and the person eating oranges is in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is not in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet is directly left of the person eating a banana. This means the person eating a banana is in house 3, and the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2.

From clue 9, the person with a gameboy is to the left of the basketball player. This means the basketball player is in house 3 or 4, and the person with a gameboy is in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 10, the person with loafers is not in house 2.

From clue 11, the person with a phone is to the left of the person with sandals. This means the person with sandals is in house 3 or 4, and the person with a phone is in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 12, the person with a gameboy is to the left of the basketball player. This means the basketball player is in house 3 or 4, and the person with a gameboy is in house 1, 2, or 3.

By process of elimination and using the clues, we can determine the following:
- House 1: Person with a gameboy, wearing loafers, eating oranges
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet, eating a banana
- House 3: Person with a computer, wearing sandals, eating kiwis
- House 4: Person with a phone, swimming

So, the person wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Mangoes

From clue 2 and 5, horses cannot be in house 1 or 2, so horses must be in house 3 or 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. This means they can be in:
- House 1 and 2
- House 2 and 3
- House 3 and 4

From clue 4, the banana eater is not in house 3, so the banana eater must be in house 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the dog owner must be in house 3 or 4, and the banana eater must be in house 2 or 1.

Let's put this together:
- House 1: Mangoes (from clue 1)
- House 2: Kiwi or Banana (from clue 6 and 4)
- House 3: Horses or Dog (from clue 2 and 5)
- House 4: Banana or Horses (from clue 5 and 6)

Since the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner, and the banana eater cannot be in house 3, the banana eater must be in house 2, and the dog owner must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mangoes
- House 2: Banana
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Horses

The bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other, and the only places left are house 1 and 2, but house 2 is already taken by the banana eater. So, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in house 4 and 3, but house 3 is the dog owner, so the bird keeper must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
3. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
4. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 1, we know the mystery book reader is in house 1. So, house 1 is taken.

From clue 2, the romance book lover cannot be in house 3. So, the romance book lover must be in house 2 or 1.

From clue 3, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 3. So, the person who owns horses must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 4, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3. But since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 and the history book buff must be in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: History book buff

Since the romance book lover cannot be in house 3 (clue 2) and the bird keeper is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From clue 4, the mystery book reader does not live in the second house, so the mystery book reader must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the first house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the soccer player, so this means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who had stew cannot live in the third house. So, the person who had stew must live in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must live in the second house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the person who had stew lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the golfer must live in the first and third houses. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the golfer must live in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This is consistent with our arrangement.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This is also consistent with our arrangement.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This is consistent with our arrangement.

So, the arrangement is:
1. First house: Rose bouquet, high heels, mystery book reader
2. Second house: Daffodils, stew, soccer player
3. Third house: Carnations, running shoes, history book buff

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the third house.

5. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

From clue 6, we know the flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, if the flutist is in house 1, the minivan must be in house 2. If the flutist is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 3. But from clue 5, the minivan must be to the right of the truck, so the flutist cannot be in house 2 or 3. Therefore, the flutist must be in house 1, and the minivan must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the cellist and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1 or 3. But the flutist is in house 1, so the cellist must be in house 3.

From clue 2, the person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the truck and gameboy must be in house 1 and 3, but the cellist is in house 3, so the truck must be in house 1 and the gameboy in house 3.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3 and the gameboy is in house 3, the television and high heels must be in house 1 and 2. But the minivan is in house 2, so the high heels must be in house 1 and the television in house 2.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the high heels are in house 1, the percussionist must be in house 1 and the boots in house 2. But the minivan is in house 2, so the boots must be in house 3.

"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. From clue 4, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew. So, if someone has a minivan, the next house to the right must have someone who had stew for lunch.

2. From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, the person with the minivan and the bouquet of daffodils are next to each other.

3. From clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. So, the person with the rose bouquet and the truck are next to each other.

4. From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who likes blue and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other.

5. From clue 2, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. So, the person who had stew is not in the last house.

6. From clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the first house. So, the person who likes red must live in the second or third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person with the minivan and the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first and second houses.
- The person with the rose bouquet and the truck must be in the second and third houses.
- The person who likes blue and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first and second houses.

- House 3: Flutist
- House 4: Basketball player and SUV owner

5. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
6. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 5, stew and pizza are next to each other. From clue 6, the person who likes red is left of the sedan owner. Let's place these clues in the houses:

- If the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who likes red must be in house 2, but house 2 is the soccer player, so this is not possible.
- If the sedan owner is in house 2, the person who likes red must be in house 1, but house 1 is unknown, so this is possible.
- If the sedan owner is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2, but house 2 is the soccer player, so this is not possible.
- If the sedan owner is in house 4, the person who likes red must be in house 3, but house 3 is the flutist, so this is not possible.

So, the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person who likes red must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Person who likes red and owns a sedan
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: Flutist
- House 4: Basketball player and SUV owner

From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist cannot be in house 1 (red car), and the soccer player is in house 2, the saxophonist must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is the flutist, so the saxophonist must be in house 4.

From clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, which we already know. So, the sedan owner is in house 1.

From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house, so the grilled cheese eater must be in house 1, 2, or 3. Since house 1 is the sedan owner and house 2 is the soccer player, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 3.

From clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house, so the green car owner must be in house 1, 2, or 4. Since house 1 is the sedan owner and house 4 is the SUV owner, the green car owner must be in house 2.

From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house, so the white car owner must be in house 4.

From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. Since the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes red and owns a sedan

- House 4: Basketball player and SUV owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1.

5. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

From clue 2, the person with a phone is in house 1 (since the person with running shoes is in house 3).

From clue 3, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 and house 2, but we already know house 2 is for the person who likes red. So, the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is wearing sandals is in house 2.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples (house 1) and the person who is wearing sandals (house 2) have one house between them, which is correct.

So, the second house has the person eating grapes, the golfer, and the romance book lover.

From clue 2, the golfer lives in the fourth house. So, House 4 = Golfer.

From clue 9, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. This means the basketball player cannot be in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti) and cannot be in the fourth house (since the golfer is there). So, the basketball player must be in the third house, and the pizza eater must be in the second house. So, House 2 = Pizza, and House 3 = Basketball player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the pizza eater is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the first house. But we already know the first house has spaghetti. So, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the pizza eater must be in the fourth house. This contradicts our previous placement. Let's correct it: House 3 = Pizza, and House 4 = Basketball player. The percussionist must be in the second house. So, House 2 = Percussionist.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house, and the saxophonist must be in the fifth house. But there is no fifth house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house, and the saxophonist must be in the fourth house. So, House 3 = Fantasy book enthusiast, and House 4 = Saxophonist.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the basketball player lives in the second house.
2. The violinist also lives in the second house, so this means the basketball player and the violinist are the same person, living in house 2.
3. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot live in house 3, because then the cellist would not have a house to the right.
4. Since the violinist is in house 2, the cellist and the cricketer must be in houses 1 and 3, but we don't know which is which yet.
5. The soccer player is the only one left, and since the basketball player and violinist are in house 2, the soccer player must be in either house 1 or 3.
6. Because the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, the cricketer must be in house 1 and the cellist in house 3.

From clues 1 and 2, we know:
- The fourth house is occupied by the coffee drinker and the flutist.

From clue 3, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the fourth house is taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist, the tennis player and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house, and the basketball player cannot be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the guitarist must be in house 1, 2, or 4. But since the fourth house is taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist, the guitarist must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 5, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in house 1, 2, or 4. But since the fourth house is taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist, the violinist must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 7, the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

Let's put it all together:

- The tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other, and they cannot be in the fourth house.
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who is eating grapes does not live in the fifth house.

- House 5: Not grapes

Since the person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement, and there is one house between the carnations and lilies, we can place the carnations and lilies in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But since House 4 is already taken by the SUV, the carnations must be in House 2 and lilies in House 3.

- House 2: Carnations
- House 3: Lilies

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 (left of the minivan) and the minivan must be in House 2, but House 2 is already taken by the carnations. So, the daffodils must be in House 1 and the minivan in House 3.

- House 1: Daffodils
- House 3: Minivan

The person who is eating apples must be in House 2 (left of the daffodils).

- House 2: Apples

"(A) No

Pigs, like other animals, don't understand or use human languages like Pig Latin. But it's not impossible for them to learn sounds or even simple commands. It's just that they don't use language in the way humans do."
"To answer this question, we need to think about Ringo Starr's preferences. Ringo Starr is a musician, and he enjoys eating different foods. There's no specific information that tells us he avoids pot roast. So, we can't say for sure that he would avoid it.

Given the options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

Since we don't have enough information to say he would avoid it, the best answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

The 1936 Summer Olympics venue, called the Olympiastadion Berlin, is a big stadium. The Superbowl usually has a lot of people watching, but the Olympiastadion can hold more than 70, 000 people. That's bigger than most Superbowl crowds, so it would be fine for a Superbowl."
"(A) No

Brown rock fish are not commonly found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis. The fish found in these waters are more likely to be species like the yellowtail snapper or the blue tang."
"(B) No

Growing seedless cucumbers might not be the best choice for a gardener with entomophobia. Seedless cucumbers often rely on bees and other insects for pollination. If the gardener is afraid of insects, dealing with them regularly could be stressful. Seedless cucumbers can also be more difficult to grow without pollination, which might add extra challenges."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Martin Luther wrote 95 theses in 1517, which is the famous event that started the Protestant Reformation.
2. If he wrote one thesis a day, we need to know how many days are in half a year.
3. Half a year is about 182.5 days (since a year has about 365 days).

Now, if Martin Luther wrote one thesis every day for 182.5 days, he would have written 182.5 theses. Since he wrote 95 theses in one famous event, he would still have many theses left to write.

So, the answer is (B) No. He would not run out in half a year if he wrote one thesis a day."
"(A) No

Waltz is a slow and gentle dance where people don't move around much and there's not much jumping or bumping. Slam dance, on the other hand, is a more energetic dance where people jump and bump into each other, which can be more likely to cause injuries. So, waltz is usually less injurious than slam dance."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny is made of steel and zinc, not silver. Even though it might look silvery, it's not actually silver. Using it to make silverware would not be a good idea because it could be dangerous. Silverware needs to be made of real silver to be safe and to keep its quality. Also, using a coin for something it wasn't made for can damage the coin and make it less valuable."
"(B) Yes

It would be very difficult to snowboard on Venus. Venus is very hot, with temperatures around 462 degrees Celsius (about 864 degrees Fahrenheit) - that's much hotter than a hot day in summer! Also, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere with clouds made of sulfuric acid, which would make it hard to breathe and snowboard. So, snowboarding on Venus would be very challenging and not possible with our current technology."
"(B) No

Hermes is the Greek god of messengers, commerce, and travel. He's like a speedy helper who brings messages. In Roman mythology, the god who's similar to Hermes is actually Mercury, not Vulcan. Vulcan is the Roman god of fire and metalworking, which is more like the Greek god Hephaestus."
"(A) No

Ariana Grande is a singer and not typically related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a way that would make her a relevant topic in a presentation about PTSD.

Euphoria, which is a feeling of intense happiness or excitement, can be associated with drug addiction. When people use drugs, they might feel very happy or excited for a short time. This feeling can make them want to keep using the drug, which can lead to addiction. But remember, it's not good to use drugs because they can hurt your body and mind."
"(A) No

Let me explain why in a simple way:
Apollo was a god in Greek stories, and he had special powers. D'Artagnan was a brave man in French stories, but he didn't have any special powers. Apollo could do things like fly, make things disappear, and talk to animals. D'Artagnan was just a very good swordsman and fighter. So, even if there were many D'Artagnans, they couldn't beat all the Apollo gods because Apollo had much more power."
"(A) No

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Bob Marley died from a type of skin cancer called melanoma, which is related to sun exposure.

Week-old chlorine water might not be safe to drink. When you add chlorine to water, it needs time to kill germs. After a week, the chlorine might not be strong enough to keep the water safe. It's best to let the water sit for at least 24 hours after adding chlorine to make sure it's safe to drink."
"(B) No

A dichromat has a color vision defect that affects their ability to distinguish certain colors, usually red and green. Chlorine gas and neon gas are not visible as they are colorless. So, a dichromat or anyone else would not be able to tell the difference between them just by looking."
"(A) Yes

Elizabeth I ruled England from 1558 to 1603. The play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was written by Christopher Marlowe and was first performed around 1587, which is during Elizabeth I's reign. So, it's possible that Elizabeth I could have seen the play."
"(A) Yes

"(A) No

Sea turtles don't really have the concept of quarantine like humans do. They keep living their normal lives in the ocean. Quarantine is something that affects people and animals in human care, like in zoos or aquariums. Sea turtles in the wild just keep swimming and feeding as usual."
"B) No

Jesus lived a long time ago, about 2000 years, in a different time and place. He didn't know about things that came much later, like the Easter Bunny. The Easter Bunny is a tradition that people started much later to celebrate Easter in a fun way. Jesus wouldn't know about it because it wasn't around when he was alive."
"(A) No

An elephant is much bigger and stronger than a male macaque. Elephants are very big animals with strong bodies, while macaques are small monkeys. So, an elephant would easily defeat a macaque."

"(A) Yes

Robert Wadlow was the tallest person ever officially recorded, standing at about 8 feet 11.1 inches tall. A German Shepherd dog, on the other hand, is much smaller, usually around 2 to 2.7 feet tall at the shoulder. So, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd."

Ryan Crouser is a very strong athlete, but a Bengal fox is much smaller and lighter than a shot put or other objects he throws in the sport of shot put. Even the smallest Bengal fox weighs around 5 to 9 pounds, which is much lighter than what Ryan Crouser can throw. So, he wouldn't be able to throw a Bengal fox with ease."
"(B) Yes

Lord Voldemort's rules at Hogwarts would have barred him because his rules were very strict and he didn't want anyone who was not pure-blood. Since Voldemort himself was a half-blood (his mother was a Muggle and his father was a wizard), he wouldn't have been allowed under his own rules."
"(A) No

The Jackson 5 was a family band with five brothers, but The Isley Brothers are actually a group of brothers too. They have had different members over the years, but they are also known as a family band. So, it's not clear which one was bigger as family bands, but The Jackson 5 is not considered bigger just because they had five brothers playing together."
"(B) No

You don't need lactobacillus specifically to make pickles. You can make pickles using salt and vinegar. Lactobacillus is a type of bacteria that can help in making pickles, but it's not necessary. When you make pickles, you create an environment that can naturally have these bacteria, but you can also buy them if you want. The salt and vinegar help to preserve the pickles and give them that yummy flavor!"

"(B) No

Travelers on the Oregon Trail in the 19th century didn't sing sea shanties. Sea shanties were songs sung by sailors to help them work together on ships. The Oregon Trail was a land route used by settlers moving west in wagons, not by sailors. So, the travelers on the Oregon Trail would have sung different kinds of songs, like folk songs or hymns, to pass the time or to keep spirits up during their long journey."
"(A) Yes

Shooting a bald eagle can get a person in a lot of trouble. It's against the law and can lead to very serious consequences, including a lot of time in prison. Michael Vick, who was a famous football player, got into trouble for a different kind of animal-related crime. He was involved in a dog fighting case. The punishment for shooting a bald eagle can be harsher because bald eagles are a protected species. So, yes, it could get someone more prison time than what Michael Vick faced."
"(B) No

Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, which means he lived before television was invented. Bonanza started in 1959, so Gandhi couldn't have watched it."

"(B) No

People don't celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. Earth Day is about taking care of our planet and protecting the environment.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. A leap year happens every 4 years.

Given their different backgrounds and beliefs, it's unlikely they would have been friends."
"(B) No

"(B) No

Explanation: The brother of Goofy's creator's employer is not a real person from history or religion. Goofy is a cartoon character created by Disney, and his creator was Art Babbitt. Babbitt worked for Walt Disney, so his employer was Walt Disney. But we don't know who Walt Disney's brother was or if he did something that would make him excommunicable. Excommunication is a big word that means being kicked out of a church. Since we don't have information about a brother of Walt Disney and what he might have done, we can't say yes."
"(A) Yes

Sometimes people with mental disorders can hide them well. They might feel okay in public but have struggles that they keep to themselves. But it's important to remember that even if someone seems fine, they might still need help."
"(A) Yes

Paul Bunyan is a legendary giant from American folklore known for his enormous size and strength. He's famous for tasks like cutting down trees and digging lakes, which are more suited to rural areas rather than urban settings. Urban planning involves designing and managing cities and towns, which require careful consideration of space, infrastructure, and community needs. Paul's size and strength might be a problem in an urban environment where there's a lot of close space and delicate structures. So, he would likely be a poor choice for an urban planner."
"(A) Yes

"(A) No

Kaffir lime has a strong, unique flavor that includes notes of citrus and a bit of a bitter edge. It's commonly used in Asian cuisines, especially Thai and Vietnamese, for dishes like curries and soups. A White Russian, on the other hand, is a cocktail made with vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream. The flavors in a White Russian are more about coffee and cream, so adding kaffir lime wouldn't really fit and might not taste good."
"(B) No

Goblin sharks don't have limbs. They have a very unusual body shape with a long snout and no visible fins or limbs like other sharks. So, even if we imagine a scenario where a goblin shark suddenly had limbs, it would still be very difficult for it to ride a bike because its body is not built for such activities. Sharks are adapted to swimming in water, not riding bicycles on land."
"(B) Yes

Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of Nirvana, a band that played in the grunge music genre. Even after Kurt Cobain passed away, the grunge music genre continued to influence and inspire new artists.

"(A) Yes

A slingshot would be improperly classified as artillery. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons like cannons, rockets, or mortars that are used to fire explosive shells over long distances. A slingshot, on the other hand, is a simple tool used to launch small stones or projectiles over short distances. It's more like a toy or a hunting tool, not artillery."
"(B) Yes, but it depends on the soup. For thick soups like chili or split pea soup, you can eat them with your hands. For thin soups like broth, it's better to use a spoon."
"(A) No

Katy Perry is known for pop and pop rock music, not gospel music. Most of her fans follow her for her catchy pop songs and performances. Gospel music is a different style that many people enjoy, but it's not what Katy Perry is famous for."

"(A) Yes

Iris and Hermes from Greek mythology might struggle at a UPS job for a few reasons. First, Iris was the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger for the gods.

Hermes, the messenger god, could do some tasks but might find the paperwork and modern technology challenging. So, they might need some help to do the job well!"
"(A) No

Cookie Monster loves to eat cookies, which are not allowed in the Paleo diet. The Paleo diet is about eating foods that our ancestors ate, like meat, fruits, and vegetables, but cookies are not on that list. So, Cookie Monster's diet wouldn't be Paleo friendly."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. First, we need to know what pi and the square root of 5 are.
2. Pi (π) is about 3.14159.
3. The square root of 5 is a bit more than 2 because 2 times 2 is 4 (which is less than 5) and 3 times 3 is 9 (which is more than 5).
4. If we calculate it more closely, the square root of 5 is about 2.236.

Now, comparing the two:
- Pi is about 3.14159
- The square root of 5 is about 2.236

Since 3.14159 is more than 2.236, we can say that pi is indeed more than the square root of 5.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(A) Yes

Breast cancer is often associated with a pink ribbon. This ribbon is used to raise awareness and support for people affected by breast cancer."
"(B) No

Lactic acid in your body is not bad. When you exercise, your muscles make lactic acid. Sometimes, when you exercise a lot, your muscles can't get rid of all the lactic acid, and it can make you feel a bit tired or sore. But this is normal and usually goes away after resting. Lactic acid is actually helpful because it gives your muscles the energy they need to keep working hard!"
"(A) No

The Gunpowder Plot in 1605 was an attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I and the English aristocracy. It did not affect Mary, Queen of Scots, who was already executed in 1587. So, the plot couldn't eliminate her bloodline."
"(B) No

Alice from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is a young girl, and Masonic Lodges typically require members to be adults and to follow certain religious and age criteria. Alice is not old enough and the story doesn't mention her being a part of any adult organizations."
"(B) No

Bull sharks have smaller teeth compared to crocodiles, and they don't bite with as much force. Crocodiles have very strong jaws and big, sharp teeth that can cause more pain and serious injuries. So, a crocodile bite would generally hurt more than a bull shark bite."
"(A) No

Snow White is a story where the dwarfs take care of her and she marries the prince, but the part about ""good consent"" doesn't really fit because the story doesn't show her giving her own consent to anything. It's more about her being saved and then marrying someone. Consent means when someone says yes to something they want to do, and in Snow White's case, she's not really making choices about her own life."
"(A) Yes

Avengers Comics are part of the Marvel Comics universe, while DC Comics have their own set of characters and stories. So, Avengers Comics would be out of place in a DC Comics store."
"(B) No

Rhinoceroses are not killed to improve human sex lives. People sometimes think that parts of rhinoceroses, like their horns, can help with health or sex, but this is not true. Rhinoceros horns are made of the same thing as our fingernails, so they don't have any special powers. Also, killing rhinoceroses is very bad because it hurts them and makes their populations smaller. We should protect rhinoceroses instead of hurting them."
"(A) No

NFL players are athletes who play football. They don't get infantry training because that's for soldiers in the military. Infantry training is about learning to fight and use weapons, which isn't part of being an NFL player."

A quarter is much bigger than what can fit inside a human kidney. A kidney is about the size of your fist, and a quarter is much smaller than that. So, a quarter cannot fit inside a human kidney."
"(A) Yes

Bruce Gandy is a well-known organist and choirmaster, but he's not a famous singer or a well-known performer of Handel's Messiah. The role of Messiah is usually given to a famous singer who can handle the challenging vocal parts.

"(B) No

The Greek alphabet is much more common than Sumerian cuneiform. The Greek alphabet is used today in many languages like English, Greek, and others.

Here's why:

1. Binary numbers use only 0s and 1s. If you use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, it can make a password stronger.
2. The standard alphabet has 26 letters (A to Z). If you use both uppercase and lowercase letters, it also makes the password stronger.
3. Using a mix of these (binary numbers, letters, and symbols) can make a password very hard to guess.
4. The more characters and types of characters you use, the harder it is for someone to crack the password."
"(A) No

Spotting a full circle of a rainbow usually happens in the sky, not on the beach. Rainbows appear when light passes through water droplets in the air, like after it rains.

"(B) No

Abdulqawi Yusuf is a former President of the International Court of Justice. The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, Netherlands.

Nancy Pelosi and Gerald Ford were from different times and different political parties. Gerald Ford was a Republican who was the President from 1974 to 1977.

Here's why: In a Sudoku puzzle, you fill a 9x9 grid with numbers 1 through 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating any number. Roman numerals use letters like I, V, X, etc., to represent numbers. For example, I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, and so on. Since Roman numerals don't have symbols for all the numbers from 1 to 9, you can't use them to fill a Sudoku puzzle properly. That's why the answer is (B) No."
"(A) No

Let's think about it this way: Netflix shows can be big, like lots of pictures put together. If you watch Netflix for 10 hours a day, that's a lot of shows! Now, 500GB is like having 500 big books. But each Netflix show can be as big as 10 to 20 of those books. So, if you watch 10 hours of Netflix, you might need space for 20 to 40 big books. That's more than 500GB can hold. So, 500GB is not enough."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Jon Brower Minnoch was a person who had the heaviest recorded case of hyperphagia (an extreme eating disorder). He weighed over 1,400 pounds (635 kg) at his heaviest.

2. The mass of Voyager 2, a spacecraft, is much smaller. It was about 1,500 pounds (680 kg) at launch.

3. Jon Brower Minnoch was so heavy that he could not even lift himself out of a wheelchair. He couldn't even apply enough force to break a chair.

4. Voyager 2, on the other hand, is a spacecraft designed to travel through space. It's much lighter than Jon Brower Minnoch.

So, the answer is (B) No. Jon Brower Minnoch would not be able to break a chair, and he certainly wouldn't be able to lift something as heavy as a spacecraft."
"(B) No

Hedgehogs can't avoid animals without a spinal cord because all animals, including hedgehogs, have spinal cords.

"(A) No

The iPhone didn't start a scientific revolution. It's a cool phone that helps people do lots of things, but it's not about big changes in science like the scientific revolution was.

"(B) No

Handedness, which means if you prefer to use your right hand or left hand for tasks, doesn't really decide how you use American Sign Language. American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language, and how you sign is more about where you put your hands, your face, and your body. It's like drawing a picture with your hands! So, whether you're right-handed or left-handed doesn't change how you make the signs in ASL."

The crash was not because of United Airlines being bad, but because of a mechanical problem."

"No, we can't substitute the pins in a bowling alley lane with Dustin Hoffman's Oscars. Here's why:

1. Bowling pins are made of wood or plastic and are designed to be knocked down by the ball.
2. Oscars are made of gold-plated bronze and are much heavier and more valuable than bowling pins.
3. Bowling pins are meant to be knocked down for scoring points, while Oscars are given to recognize achievements in the film industry.
4. It wouldn't make sense to use Oscars as pins because they are not designed for the purpose of bowling and could be damaged easily.

So, the correct answer is (A) No."
"(A) No

Beavers have strong teeth that are good for cutting wood, but Smilodon, also known as the saber-toothed cat, had much longer and sharper teeth.

This is the opposite of what the Communist Party believed in."
"(A) No

Here's why: In the United States, to run for president, you need to be at least 35 years old. The age of the student in eleventh grade is not a barrier.

To understand this, let's think about it step by step:

1. A military division is a large group of soldiers and support staff. It needs to have a lot of people to function properly.
2. The population of Ashland, Oregon in 2018 was about 22,000 people.
3. A military division typically has around 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and support staff.
4. Since Ashland's population (22,000) is more than enough to fill a military division (10,000 to 20,000), it would be adequate.

So, the answer is (A) No, the population of Ashland, Oregon in 2018 would be adequate to be a hypothetical military division."

Let's think about this step by step:
1. The 1933 Great Depression was a very hard time when many people lost their jobs.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Jennifer Lawrence is an actress. Her middle name is ""Kathlyn.""
2. Martin Scorsese is a director. Some of his frequent collaborators include actors like Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio.
3. We need to check if Kathlyn is similar to any of these collaborators' names.

"To answer this question, we need to think about who General Zod is and what he might prefer. General Zod is a character from the Superman comics and movies. He's from Krypton and is a powerful alien. He doesn't use phones like the ones we have today, so it's hard to know what he would prefer.

But if we pretend he's like us and likes the same things, we can think about it. Both iPhones and Samsung Galaxy S4 are good phones, but they have different features. It's like asking if you prefer chocolate ice cream or vanilla ice cream. It depends on what you like!

Since we don't know for sure what General Zod would prefer, we can't say for certain. But if we had to pick, we might say:

(B) No

This is because General Zod is from a different world and might have different preferences. But remember, this is just a guess!"

"(A) No

Sainsbury's is a big grocery store in the UK, but it's not big enough to buy Tesco, which is even bigger. Think of it like this: if Sainsbury's was a small toy car, Tesco would be a big truck. The truck is just too big for the small car to buy it!"
"(B) No

"(A) No

Poland Spring comes from Maine, a place in the United States. The Sahara Desert is very far away and not a good place to get water from natural springs. Also, it's very hot and dry there, so people there might not want spring water. So, Poland Spring probably can't make money in the Sahara."

Urban legends don't have to happen in cities. They can happen anywhere! People tell these stories in towns, villages, and even in big cities. The important part is that they are interesting tales that people like to share and believe, not where they take place."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. First, we need to know how much money the richest billionaire in 2020 had. The richest person in 2020 was Jeff Bezos, and he was worth about $112 billion.

2. Now, let's think about how much Cambodia costs. Cambodia is a country, and owning a whole country would be very, very expensive. But even buying all the land and businesses in Cambodia would cost a lot of money.

3. The cost of owning Cambodia would be in the trillions of dollars, which is much more than $112 billion.

4. So, even though Jeff Bezos was the richest person, the cost of owning Cambodia would be much more than what he had.

Therefore, the answer is (B) No. The richest billionaire in 2020 would not find Cambodia too expensive to own."
"(B) No

The 40th president of the United States is Jimmy Carter, who served from 1977 to 1981. Lolcats, which are pictures of cats with humorous captions, became popular much later, around 2007.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Ancient Greece had many city-states. These were like small countries, but we don't know exactly how many.
2. In 1900, the United States had 45 states.
3. Ancient Greece had more than 100 city-states, but it was spread out over a long time and not all at once.
4. So, if we compare the number of states in Ancient Greece to the 45 states in the U.S. in 1900, we can see that Ancient Greece had more.

So, the answer is (B) No. The number of states in Ancient Greece was not underwhelming compared to the U.S. states in 1900."

"(A) No

Cheb Mami, who is a singer and musician, could theoretically win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition, but it's not very common for non-composers to win in that category.

2. A new iPhone 11 is just one thing you can buy. It's not as expensive as all the things you need to do to run for President.

3. The cost to run for President is much, much bigger than the cost of an iPhone 11. It's like comparing the cost of a whole school to just one toy.

So, the answer is (A) Yes, it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11."

It's important not to assume that everyone in a certain age group has the same abilities."

Professional boxers might not expect to have low dental bills because boxing can be very hard on teeth and jaws. The sport involves a lot of contact, which can lead to broken teeth, knocked-out teeth, and other dental issues.

"To answer this question, we need to know the presidential number of Andrew Johnson and the Emperor number of Elagabalus.

Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States. He became president in 1865 after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.

Elagabalus was an Emperor of Rome. He is not considered a numbered Emperor like those in the Roman Empire's later periods. He is often referred to as the 20th or 21st Emperor, but this is not a standard numbering system used for Roman Emperors.

So, Andrew Johnson's presidential number is 17, and Elagabalus does not have a standard numbered position as an Emperor.

(A) Yes"
