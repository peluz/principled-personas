"Let's figure dis out. 

We know the person who likes green lives in the first house. So, the first house is green. We also know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. 

From clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in the first house, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in the second and third houses. 

Now, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house. 

From clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house. So, the percussionist must live in the first house or the third house. But the person who likes green is in the first house, so the percussionist must live in the third house. 

Now, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house and the percussionist lives in the third house. But we can't have two people in the same house, so the percussionist must live in the first house and the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house. 

Now, we know the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the percussionist lives in the first house. But we already know the person who likes green lives in the first house, so the percussionist must live in the first house and the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house. 

Now, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. So, the cellist must live in the first house. 

The answer is (A) 1."

"I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a SUV is or what a minivan is. I just know that there's a person in each house and they all have different things. Let me try to make a list of what we know.

- House 1: person eats apples
- House 2: ? 
- House 3: ? 
- House 4: ?

From clue 3, the person in house 3 is wearing high heels. 

From clue 9, the person in house 1 eats apples.

From clue 12, the person in house 2 eats mangos and the person in house 3 had pizza.

From clue 10, the person in house 1 had pizza.

So, the person in house 2 eats mangos and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels and had pizza.

From clue 1, the person in house 1 drives a truck and the person in house 2 drives an SUV.

From clue 6, the person in house 2 eats fried rice.

From clue 7, the person in house 1 is a tea drinker.

So, the person in house 1 is a tea drinker, eats apples, had pizza, and drives a truck.

The answer is (B) 1."

"I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a saxophonist is or what a violinist is. I just know they play different instruments. I don't know what carnations, tulips, or daffodils are, but they're flowers. I don't know what science fiction, mystery, or history books are, but they're different kinds of books. I don't know what pizza, fried rice, or spaghetti are, but they're different foods. I don't know what a radio, television, or phone is, but they're different things. 

Let me try to think about it. The violinist lives in the first house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house, so the percussionist must live in the second house. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live next to each other. The person who has a vase of tulips can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second or third house. The person who has a vase of tulips can't live in the third house because the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who has a phone. The person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house."
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the history book buff can't live in the second house, so the history book buff must live in the first house. 

From clue 4, the person with a bouquet of lilies can't live in the first house, so the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the person with a rose bouquet must live in the third house, and the person with a gameboy must live in the second house.

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house. The answer is (C)."

"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 2, we know the person wearin' boots don't live in house 1. So, the person wearin' boots must live in house 2. 

From clue 1, we know the person drivin' a convertible lives left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff can't live in house 1, 'cause the person in house 1 would be drivin' a convertible, and the person in house 2 would be wearin' boots, but we already know that. 

So, the history book buff must live in house 2. And the person in house 1 must be drivin' a convertible. 

Now, the only one left is the person wearin' sandals. They must live in house 1, 'cause the person in house 2 is already taken by the history book buff. 

So, the answer is (A) 1."

From clue 2, we know the person with a gameboy lives left of the person with a computer. 

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives left of the person with a gameboy. 

So, the order for the first two houses is: green, gameboy.

Now, we know the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house (clue 3). 

So, the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or the third house. 

If the person who likes yellow lived in the first house, then the order would be: yellow, green, gameboy, computer. But this can't be right because the person with a gameboy lives left of the person with a computer, and the person with a gameboy is already in the second house. 

So, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house. 

The order is: green, gameboy, yellow. 

The person with a computer must live in the second house. 

The answer is (A) 2."

This means the person with the radio and the person who had pizza must be the same person. But we also know the person with the radio lives in the second house, and the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the person with the radio and the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

Now we know the person with the radio and the person who had pizza live in the second house.

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. We also know the person with the radio lives in the second house, so the person with the radio must be the fish enthusiast.

Now we know the person with the radio lives in the second house, and the person who had pizza lives in the second house. We also know the person with the radio is the fish enthusiast, so the person who had pizza must be the cat lover.

"Let's figure dis out. We know the person with running shoes lives in the first house. That's clue 1. 

Now, clue 5 says the person with running shoes and the person with boots live next to each other. Since the person with running shoes is in the first house, the person with boots must be in the second house. 

Clue 6 says the person with an SUV lives in the fourth house. 

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We already know the first and second houses. The person with the SUV is in the fourth house, so the order is: 1, 2, 3, 4, SUV, 5. 

Clue 3 says the person with a minivan lives left of the person with high heels. Clue 4 says the person with sandals lives left of the person with a convertible. Since the person with running shoes is in the first house, the person with sandals must be in the second house. The person with boots is in the second house, but we already know that. So, the person with sandals is in the second house, and the person with boots is in the third house. 

Now, the order is: 1, 2, sandals, 3, boots, 4, SUV, 5. 

Clue 2 says the person with a sedan does not live in the third house. We know the person with boots is in the third house, so the person with a sedan must be in the fifth house. 

Now, the order is: 1, 2, sandals, 3, boots, 4, SUV, 5, sedan. 

The person with a convertible must be in the second house, because the person with sandals is in the second house. 

Now, the order is: 1, 2, convertible, 3, boots, 4, SUV, 5, sedan. 

The person with high heels must be in the fourth house, because the person with a minivan lives left of the person with high heels. 

Now, the order is: 1, 2, convertible, 3, boots, 4, high heels, 5, sedan. 

The person with a minivan must be in the third house, because the person with a minivan lives left of the person with high heels.

"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 2, the cricketer lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who owns horses can't be in the first house, 'cause the cricketer is already there. So, the person who owns horses must be in the second house. 

Now, the person who owns a sedan can't be in the first house (cricketer) or the second house (horses). So, the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan. This means the cat lover must be in the third house, but we already know the person in the third house owns a sedan. So, the cat lover must be in the second house, but we already know the person in the second house owns horses. This is a problem. 

Wait, I made a mistake. The cat lover can't be in the second house. The cat lover must be in the third house, and the person in the second house must be the person who owns a sedan. 

Now, the person who owns a truck lives to the right of the basketball player (clue 1). This means the person who owns a truck can't be in the first house (cricketer) or the second house (sedan). So, the person who owns a truck must be in the third house. But we already know the person in the third house is the cat lover. This is another problem.

Wait, I made another mistake. The person in the third house can't be the cat lover. The person in the third house must be the person who owns a truck. The cat lover must be in the second house, and the person in the second house must be the person who owns a sedan. 

Now, the person in the first house is the cricketer, the person in the second house is the cat lover who owns a sedan, and the person in the third house is the person who owns a truck. 

From clue 1, the person who owns a truck lives to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player can't be in the third house (truck).

From clue 3, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. 

From clue 4, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. 

Now, let's put dis together. If the swimmer is not in the first house, and the swimmer lives left of the person who owns a sedan, then the swimmer must be in the second house. 

If the swimmer is in the second house, then the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house. 

Now, we know the basketball player lives left of the person who drives a truck. If the basketball player is in the first house, then the person who drives a truck must be in the second house. But we already know the swimmer is in the second house. So, the basketball player must be in the second house is not possible. 

So, the basketball player must be in the third house. 

Now, we know the person who drives a truck lives left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. If the basketball player is in the third house, then the person who drives a truck must be in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker doesn't live in the second house, so the tea drinker lives in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means the person with a television lives in the first house, and the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a television lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know there's one house between the flutist and the person who eats a banana. This means the flutist lives in the first house, and the person who eats a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who eats kiwis lives to the right of the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker lives in the first house, and the person who eats kiwis lives in the third house. But we already know the person who eats a banana lives in the third house, so the person who eats kiwis must live in the third house, and the person who eats a banana must live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with a radio. This means the person with a radio lives in the first house, and the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house. But we already know the guitarist lives in the second house, so the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house, and the person with a radio must live in the first house.

Now we know the order of the houses: 1, 2, 3. We know the person in the first house has a radio, eats coffee, and has a television. We know the person in the second house has a vase of tulips, eats a banana, and is a guitarist. We know the person in the third house has a rose bouquet, eats kiwis, and is a tea drinker.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate fried rice don't live in house 1. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the person who owns an SUV don't live in house 2. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in house 1.

From clue 3, we know the flutist lives left of the person who likes white. And from clue 4, we know the person who wears loafers lives left of the person who likes white. This means the person who likes white must live in house 2, because if the person who likes white lived in house 1, then the flutist would have to live in house 2, which is not possible since the person who wears loafers lives left of the person who likes white.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 2. And since the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2, the person who likes white must have eaten spaghetti.

Now, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in house 1, and the person who likes white lives in house 2. The person who wears loafers lives left of the person who likes white, so the person who wears loafers must live in house 1. The person who owns a sedan must live in house 2.

- Person 1 or 2 likes history, and person 1 or 2 likes science fiction.
- Person 1 or 2 plays baseball, and person 1 or 2 plays golf.
- Person 1 or 2 plays guitar, and person 1 or 2 plays percussion.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. This means they can't be in house 1 and 2, because they have to be next to each other. So, they must be in house 1 and 2, but not in the same house. 

From clue 3, the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. This means the person with daffodils can't be in house 2, because the guitarist would be in house 3, and there's no house 3. So, the person with daffodils must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2.

From clue 1, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, and the golfer must be in house 2.

Now we have: 
- House 1: science fiction book fanatic, daffodils, guitar, and golf
- House 2: history book buff, tulips, pizza, and baseball

The person in house 1 is the science fiction book fanatic, and the person in house 2 is the history book buff. The person in house 1 is the guitarist, and the person in house 2 is the percussionist."

I don't know how to do this. I don't know what a mystery book reader is. Is it someone who reads books about mysteries? I don't know how to figure out where they live.
I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a bouquet of lilies is. Is it like a bunch of flowers? I don't know how to use all these clues to find the answer.
"I don't know much about books or sports, but I can try to figure it out. 

From the clue, I know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. That's clue 1. 

Clue 2 says the tennis player don't live in the first house. That means the tennis player lives in the second house. 

If the tennis player lives in the second house, then the first house must be the one with the mystery book reader. And the second house must be the one with the tennis player. 

Since the fantasy book reader is the only one left, they must live in the first house. But we already know the first house is the mystery book reader. So the fantasy book reader must live in the second house. 

The answer is (B) 2."

We know the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house. That's clue 1. 

Clue 2 says the bird keeper and the person wearin' high heels live next to each other. That means one of 'em lives in the first house and the other lives in the second house. But we already know the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house, so the bird keeper must live in the second house.

Clue 3 says the tennis player and the person eatin' apples live next to each other. That means one of 'em lives in the first house and the other lives in the second house. But we already know the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house, so the tennis player must live in the first house and the person eatin' apples must live in the second house.

Clue 4 says the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house. That's easy, 'cause we already know the person in the second house is eatin' apples.

Clue 5 says the dog owner don't live in the first house. That means the dog owner must live in the second house.

Now, we got a problem. We know the bird keeper lives in the second house, but we also know the dog owner lives in the second house. That means the bird keeper can't be the dog owner. And we know the person in the second house is eatin' apples, so the bird keeper must be the person eatin' apples. But we already know the person eatin' apples is the tennis player. So, the bird keeper must be the tennis player.

Wait, that can't be right. We already know the tennis player lives in the first house. So, the bird keeper must be the person in the second house who's eatin' apples, but that's not possible. I'm all confused.

Let me try again. Clue 2 says the bird keeper and the person wearin' high heels live next to each other. Clue 5 says the dog owner don't live in the first house. That means the dog owner must live in the second house. Clue 4 says the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house. Clue 3 says the tennis player and the person eatin' apples live next to each other. Clue 1 says the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house.

I think I got it now. The person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house. The bird keeper and the person wearin' high heels live next to each other, so the bird keeper must live in the second house. The dog owner lives in the second house, so the bird keeper can't be the dog owner. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house, so the bird keeper must be the tennis player. The tennis player and the person eatin' apples live next to each other, so the tennis player must live in the first house. The person eatin' apples must live in the second house. The person wearin' high heels must be the dog owner.

So, the cricketer must live in the first house. The answer is (B)."

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. 

So, the order is: blue, apples, oranges, kiwis.

Now, we know the person who likes green must be eating kiwis, 'cause the other two fruits are already taken. 

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. 

So, the order is: blue, apples, oranges, green (kiwis).

Now, we know the person who likes white can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who likes green is in the last house. 

So, the person who likes white must be in the third house. 

The answer is (A) 3."

From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner. That means the dog owner can't be in house 1. 

From clue 3, the truck driver lives left of the sedan driver. That means the truck driver can't be in house 1 either, 'cause if the truck driver was in house 1, the sedan driver would be in house 2, and the dog owner would be in house 3, but the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner, so the fish enthusiast would be in house 2, and the cat lover would be in house 1. But clue 5 says the cat lover can't be in the second house. So the truck driver must be in house 2, and the sedan driver is in house 3. 

Now, from clue 2, there are two houses between the truck driver and the dog owner. That means the dog owner is in house 4."

From clue 5, I know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. That's a good start. 

From clue 2, I know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk.

So, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

Now, from clue 3, I know the root beer lover lives in the second house. That's good, I think.

From clue 1, I know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. And we already know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house. But wait, we already said the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house! That can't be right.

Let me think... Clue 4 says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. And we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house. And the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now, we have the person who likes blue living to the right of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house. That's gotta be right!"

"I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a bouquet is or what a foyer is. I just know that there's a person in each house and they all have different things. 

Let me try to think about it. We know the person who likes white lives in the first house. That's clue 1. 

Clue 4 says the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house. 

Clue 7 says the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other. So, the person who owns horses must live in the second house too. 

But wait, we already said the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. So, the person who owns horses must live in the second house. 

I think I got it. The person who owns horses lives in the second house. That's house number 2."
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 4, we know the person who eats apples lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, the person who eats mangos lives left of the person who eats apples. So, the person who eats mangos must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives left of the person who likes milk. And from clue 3, the coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house. So, the coffee drinker must live in the first house. 

Now, the person who likes milk must live in the second house, because the coffee drinker lives left of them. 

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a carnation is, or what a science fiction book is. I just know that there's a person in each house. Let me try to think about it.

From clue 4, I know the person with carnations lives in the first house. Clue 3 says the person who likes white lives left of the person with tulips. Clue 7 says the person with tulips lives left of the person who likes red. So, the order is: carnations, tulips, red.

From clue 2, the person with loafers and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since the person with red is third, the person with loafers must be second. Clue 1 says the science fiction book person is second, so the person with loafers must be the science fiction book person.

Now, we have: carnations, tulips, red. The person with tulips is second, but the science fiction book person is second. This means the person with tulips must be the history book buff. The person with red is third, so the person with loafers is second.

Now, we have: carnations, history book, science fiction, red. Clue 5 says the person with boots doesn't live in the third house, so the person with boots must live in the first or second house. But the first house has carnations, so the person with boots must live in the second house.

But wait, we already know the person with loafers lives in the second house. This means the person with boots can't live in the second house. So, the person with boots must live in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure dis out. 

We know the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. That's clue 2. 

Now, we know there's one house between the person who only drinks water and the person who likes milk. That means the person who likes milk lives in the third house. That's clue 1.

Now, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house. That's clue 4. 

We also know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. That means the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. 

So, the order is: 
1. Tulips
2. Lilies
3. Milk

Now, we know the person who has a rose bouquet is the only one left. So, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house. That's answer (B)."
"I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a cricketer is or what a gameboy is. I just know that there's a person in each house and they all have different things. Let me try to make a list of what we know so far.

- House 1: loafers, ?, ?, ?
- House 2: ?, ?, ?, ?
- House 3: ?, ?, gameboy, ?
- House 4: ?, ?, ?, ?

We know the person in House 1 wears loafers. We also know the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who likes yellow, so the person who has a gameboy must live in House 3 too. The person who likes yellow is a tennis player, so the tennis player lives in House 3.

We also know the person who has a phone lives left of the person who has a radio. The person who has a phone can't live in House 2, so the person who has a phone must live in House 1 or House 4. The person who has a radio can't live in House 1 because the person in House 1 wears loafers. So the person who has a radio must live in House 2 or House 4.

The person who is wearing boots can't live in House 2, so the person who is wearing boots must live in House 1, 3, or 4. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes green, so the person who likes green can't live in House 4. The person who likes green can't live in House 1 because the person in House 1 wears loafers. So the person who likes green must live in House 2 or 3.

The person who is a cricketer lives left of the person who is wearing sandals. The person who is wearing sandals can't live in House 1 because the person in House 1 wears loafers. The person who is wearing sandals can't live in House 2 because the person who likes green can't live in House 1 and the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. The person who is wearing sandals can't live in House 3 because the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. So the person who is wearing sandals must live in House 4.

The person who is a cricketer lives left of the person who is wearing sandals, so the person who is a cricketer must live in House 1, 2, or 3. The person who is a cricketer can't live in House 1 because the person in House 1 wears loafers. The person who is a cricketer can't live in House 3 because the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. So the person who is a cricketer must live in House 2.

I think the person who is a cricketer lives in House 2."

I don't know how to figure this out. I know the person with high heels lives in the second house.
"I don't know much about books or shoes, but I can try to figure it out. 

From clue 1, I know the person with loafers don't live in house 1. That means they must live in house 2. 

From clue 2, I know the mystery book reader don't live in house 2. That means they must live in house 1.

So, the person with loafers must live in house 2."
I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know how to use all these clues.
"I don't know how to figure this out. There's a person in each house, and they all have different things. One person eats mangos, and that person lives in the first house. The person with the rose lives to the left of the person with the lilies. And the saxophonist don't live in the first house. That's all I know."
I don't know how to do this. I don't know what all them clues mean.
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 2, the person with lilies lives next to the person with an SUV. 

From clue 4, the person with a rose bouquet don't live in the second house. 

From clue 3, the person with a rose bouquet lives next to the person with a sedan. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet and the person with a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3. 

The person with a rose bouquet can't be in the second house, so the person with a rose bouquet must be in house 1 or 3. 

If the person with a rose bouquet is in house 1, then the person with a sedan is in house 3. 

If the person with a rose bouquet is in house 3, then the person with a sedan is in house 1. 

From clue 2, the person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies. 

If the person with a rose bouquet is in house 1, then the person with an SUV is in house 2 and the person with lilies is in house 3. 

If the person with a rose bouquet is in house 3, then the person with an SUV is in house 2 and the person with lilies is in house 1. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips don't live in the third house. 

If the person with a rose bouquet is in house 1, then the person with tulips is in house 2. 

If the person with a rose bouquet is in house 3, then the person with tulips is in house 1. 

Now we have two possibilities:

1. The person with a rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with a sedan is in house 3, the person with an SUV is in house 2, and the person with tulips is in house 2. 

2. The person with a rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with a sedan is in house 1, the person with an SUV is in house 2, and the person with tulips is in house 1.

In the first possibility, the person with a truck is in house 3. 

In the second possibility, the person with a truck is in house 1.

So, the person with a truck lives in either house 1 or 3. 

But we can figure out which one. 

If the person with a truck is in house 1, then the person with a sedan is in house 3. 

If the person with a truck is in house 3, then the person with a sedan is in house 1. 

From clue 3, the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. 

If the person with a truck is in house 1, then the person with a sedan is in house 3 and the person with a rose bouquet is in house 1. 

If the person with a truck is in house 3, then the person with a sedan is in house 1 and the person with a rose bouquet is in house 3. 

But we already know that the person with a rose bouquet is in house 1 or 3. 

So, the person with a truck is in house 3. 

The answer is (C)."

From clue 6, the person with horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. Since the person with carnations is in the first house, the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in the second and third houses. 

From clue 6, the person with horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. The person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the person with tulips and the bird keeper must be in the second and third houses, and the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in the first and second houses. But we already know the person with carnations is in the first house. So, the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in the second and third houses.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in the first and third houses.

So, the percussionist must be in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must be in the third house.

This means the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the second house. But we already know the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in the first and second houses. So, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the second house. 

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. This means the person who owns horses must be in the first house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third house. But we already know the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in the first and second houses, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house. So, the person who owns horses must be in the first house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third house. 

From clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in the first or second house. But we already know the person with carnations is in the first house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house. So, the cellist must be in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. We already know the person with tulips must be in the second house, and the cellist must be in the second house. So, the bird keeper must be in the second house. 

The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure dis out. We know the fantasy book reader lives in the first house. We also know the cellist lives in the first house. So, the fantasy book reader and the cellist are in the first house. 

Now, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house is already taken by the fantasy book reader and the cellist, the person who likes green must live in the first house. This means the person who likes red lives in the second house.

We know the pianist and the mystery book reader are the only ones left. The person who likes red lives in the second house, and the person who likes green lives in the first house. So, the pianist must live in the second house and the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's figure dis out. We know the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the first house is number 1. The golfer lives in the second house. That means the third house is the last one. 

Now, we know there's one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic. If the golfer is in the second house, then the swimmer can't be in the second house 'cause there's only one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic. So, the swimmer must be in the third house."

"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 1, we know the person wearin' sandals lives left of the person who owns horses. So, the person who owns horses can't be in house 1, 'cause if they was, the person in house 1 would be wearin' sandals, but that's not possible 'cause the person in house 1 ate fried rice, and we don't know what they're wearin'. So, the person who owns horses must be in house 2.

Now, from clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti can't be in house 2, 'cause if they was, the history book buff would be in house 3, but there ain't no house 3. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.

Now we know the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, and the person in house 2 owns horses. We also know the person in house 1 ain't wearin' sandals, so they must be wearin' runnin' shoes. And the person in house 2 ain't wearin' runnin' shoes, so they must be wearin' sandals.

Now we know the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, wore runnin' shoes, and ain't a cat lover. The only thing left for 'em is to be a romance book lover. And the person in house 2 owns horses, wore sandals, and ain't a romance book lover. The only thing left for 'em is to be a history book buff.

So, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2, 'cause the person in house 1 ate spaghetti. The answer is (B)."

Okay, so we got 3 houses and 3 people. Each person likes a different color, plays a different instrument, and plays a different sport. 

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in the second house. That's a start.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. That means the person in the third house is the percussionist can't be the one who likes red, so the percussionist must be in the second house and the person who likes red must be in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow don't live in the second house. That means the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or the third house. But we already know the person in the third house likes red, so the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

Now we got the first house: yellow, and the second house: percussionist. We still don't know what the person in the first house plays or what the person in the second house likes.

From clue 3, we know the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. That means the basketball player can't live in the first house, because then the tennis player would be to the left of the basketball player, not to the right. So the basketball player must live in either the second or the third house.

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. That means the violinist can't live in the first house, because then the basketball player would be to the left of the violinist, not to the right. So the violinist must live in either the second or the third house.

Now we got a problem. We know the percussionist lives in the second house, and we know the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. That means the violinist must live in the third house, and the basketball player must live in the second house.

So, the basketball player lives in the second house."

"Let's figure dis out. 

We know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the order for the houses is: 1, 2 (convertible), 3.

We also know there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes white can't live in the first house, 'cause then there'd be no house between 'em. So, the person who likes white must live in the third house. But that can't be right, 'cause the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and if the person who likes white lived in the third house, the person who owns a sedan would be in the first house, and there's no room for the person who likes yellow. 

So, the person who likes white must live in the first house. That means the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. And the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, so the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we also know the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. 

So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house. 

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. 

So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house. 

But we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. 

So, the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house. 

This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house. 

Now, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. 

The only one left is the person who ate grilled cheese. 

So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

"I don't know much about houses or flowers, but I know that if the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, and the houses are numbered 1 and 2, then the person with carnations must live in the house with the lower number. So, the person with carnations lives in house 1."
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 3, we know the person who eats kiwis lives in house 2. 

From clue 2, we know the person who wears sandals lives left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes yellow can't live in house 1, 'cause if they did, the person in house 1 would be wearing sandals, but we know the person in house 1 drinks water (from clue 1). 

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. But we already know the person in house 2 eats kiwis. This means the person who likes yellow must be eating kiwis, but that's not possible 'cause the person in house 2 eats kiwis. 

This means the person who likes yellow must live in house 1. 

From clue 1, we know the person who drinks water lives left of the person who wears high heels. This means the person who wears high heels can't live in house 1, 'cause if they did, the person in house 1 would be drinking water, but we know the person in house 1 likes yellow. 

So, the person who wears high heels lives in house 2."
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 2, we know the person eatin' grapes and the person wearin' sandals live next to each other. That means they can't be in the same house, 'cause they're in different houses. So, one of 'em must be in house 1 and the other in house 2.

From clue 1, we know the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. That means the person wearin' high heels must be in house 1, and the person wearin' sandals must be in house 2.

Now, we know the person eatin' grapes is in house 2, and the person wearin' sandals is also in house 2. So, the person eatin' grapes and the person wearin' sandals must be the same person. But that's not possible, 'cause they're different people. So, we made a mistake. The person eatin' grapes can't be in house 2.

So, the person eatin' grapes must be in house 1, and the person wearin' sandals must be in house 2. The person wearin' high heels must be in house 1, 'cause they live to the left of the person wearin' sandals.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is wearin' high heels and eatin' grapes. But we also know the person in house 1 can't be the tea drinker, 'cause the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television, and the person with a television can't be in house 1, 'cause the person in house 1 is wearin' high heels and eatin' grapes. So, the person in house 1 must be the person with a phone.

The person in house 2 must be the tea drinker, 'cause the person in house 1 is the phone owner. The person in house 2 can't be the person with a television, 'cause the person with a television lives to the right of the tea drinker, and the person in house 2 is the tea drinker. So, the person in house 2 must be the person with a television.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is eatin' kiwis, 'cause they're not eatin' grapes, and the person in house 2 is eatin' grapes. So, the person in house 1 is eatin' kiwis.

"Let's figure dis out. 

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken by the tea drinker. 

The violinist don't live in the third house. So, the violinist can live in the first or the second house. But we already know the first house is taken by the tea drinker. So, the violinist must live in the second house.

Now, the guitarist lives in the third house, 'cause there's one house between the violinist and the guitarist."

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 8, we know the person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house. 

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. 

So, the person who has a computer can't live in the fourth house, and the person who has a gameboy can't live in the fourth house either. 

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. 

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. 

So, if the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the person who has a radio can't live in the second house, because there's one house between them. 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, the person who has a radio can't live in the third house, because there's one house between them. 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, the person who has a radio can't live in the fourth house, because the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house (clue 6). 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, the person who has a radio can't live in the fifth house, because there's one house between them. 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, the person who has a radio can't live in the fourth house, because the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house (clue 6). 

So, the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the fourth house. 

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. 

So, the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the fourth house, because the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the fourth house. 

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. 

So, the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the fourth house, the third house, or the second house, because the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

I don't know how to do this. I don't know what a bird keeper is. Is it like a person who keeps birds? And what's a clue? Is it like a secret? I don't understand.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives left of the cat lover. So, the person who had stew must be the cat lover, 'cause they live next to each other.

Now, from clue 1, we know the person in running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges. But we also know the person who had stew (cat lover) lives next to the mystery book reader. So, the person eating oranges must be the mystery book reader.

Now, we know the mystery book reader (eating oranges) lives left of the cat lover (had stew). So, the cat lover must live in house 2, and the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 2."
"Let's figure dis out. 

We know the root beer lover lives in the first house. So, the first house is number 1. 

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This means the person with the phone can't be in the first house, 'cause the root beer lover is already there. So, the person with the phone is in the third house. 

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person with the phone, so the person with the daffodils is in the second house. 

The person who only drinks water lives in the second house. We already know the second house has the daffodils, so the person with the daffodils is the one who drinks water.

The person who has a television does not live in the second house, and the person with the daffodils is in the second house. So, the person with the television is either in the first or the third house. 

The person with the television lives somewhere to the right of the person with the tulips. This means the person with the tulips can't be in the third house, 'cause the person with the phone is there. So, the person with the tulips is in the first house. 

Now, the person with the television can't be in the first house, 'cause the tulips are there. So, the person with the television is in the third house. 

We already know the person with the phone is in the third house, so the person with the television is also in the third house. This is a problem. We can't have two people in the third house. 

Wait, we can. We can have the person with the phone and the person with the television in the third house. This is okay. 

Now, we know the person with the tulips is in the first house, the person with the daffodils is in the second house, and the person with the phone and the television is in the third house. 

The only drink left is milk. The person with the tulips is in the first house, the person with the daffodils is in the second house, and the person with the phone and the television is in the third house. So, the person who likes milk must be in the first house.

"I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what carnations look like, but I know they're not roses or tulips. And I know dogs and cats are pets, but I don't know what a bird keeper is. I just know it's not a dog or a cat. 

Let me think... If the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper, that means the bird keeper can't be in the last house. And if the dog owner isn't in the second house, that means the dog owner is either in the first or the last house. 

If the dog owner is in the first house, that means the bird keeper is in the second house, and the person with carnations is in the last house. But then the person with tulips would have to be in the second house, which is where the bird keeper is. That can't be right.

So the dog owner must be in the last house. That means the bird keeper is in the second house, and the person with carnations is in the third house. And that means the person with tulips is in the first house.

I don't know how to figure this out. I don't know what a sedan is. Is it a big car?
"I don't know how to do this. I don't know what a gameboy is or what a television is. I just know that there's a person in each house and they all have different things. Let me try to figure it out.

From clue 5, the person who likes red lives in the second house. 

From clue 6, the person who likes white lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who likes white can't be in the first house because the person who likes red is in the second house. So the person who likes white must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red. This means the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.

From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. This means the person who is eating apples can't be in the first house because there's no house between the first and second house. So the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, but we already know that. The person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

From clue 4, the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house. We already know that the person who is eating grapes lives in the third house, so the person who has a gameboy must be eating grapes.

From clue 2, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the person who has a phone can't be in the third house because the person who has a gameboy is in the third house. The person who has a phone must be in the first house.

So the person who has a phone lives in the first house. The answer is (C) 1."

From clue 1, we know the person eatin' grapes lives left of the person drivin' a truck. That means the person eatin' grapes lives in house 1, and the person drivin' a truck lives in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the person likin' yellow lives left of the person drivin' a truck. Since the person drivin' a truck lives in house 2, the person likin' yellow lives in house 1.

From clue 2, we know the person wearin' boots lives left of the mystery book reader. This means the person wearin' boots lives in house 1, and the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

Now we know the person in house 1 likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots. The person in house 2 likes mystery books, drives a truck, and we don't know what they like yet.

Now, we know the violinist (or basketball player) lives in the second house. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, so the cricketer can't live in the second house. The cricketer must live in the first house. The cellist must live in the third house. 

The only one left is the soccer player. He must live in the first house."

From clue 4, the soccer player lives in the second house. This means the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. We don't know who ate grilled cheese yet, but we know the person who likes blue lives in the first house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now, we know the person who likes blue lives in the first house and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. This means the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese are the same person. But we also know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese live there. 

So, the root beer lover must live in the second house."

I don't know how to do this. I don't know what a computer is. Is it like a phone?
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 5, the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the dog owner can't be in the first house, 'cause the cat lover is already there. So, the dog owner must be in the third house. 

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. So, the dog owner is also the sedan owner.

From clue 4, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in the second house. 

Now, we know the second house has boots, and the third house has a sedan and a dog. The person in the first house is a cat lover. The only one left is the person who is wearing high heels and the fish enthusiast. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner, so the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house. But we already know the second house has boots. This means the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house, but that's not possible 'cause the cat lover is already there. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in the second house is wrong. 

So, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house, and the cat lover is in the second house. The person who is wearing boots is in the third house. 

Now, we know the first house has high heels, the second house has a cat, and the third house has boots. The only one left is the person who is wearing running shoes and the fish enthusiast. The person who is wearing running shoes can't be in the first house 'cause that's high heels, and can't be in the third house 'cause that's boots. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the second house."
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 4, the person with carnations lives in the first house. Clue 7 says the person with running shoes lives in the first house. So, the person with carnations and the person with running shoes both live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other. Since the person with running shoes lives in the first house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must live in the second or third house.

From clue 5, the person with tulips lives in the second house. Clue 3 also says the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other. So, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house. Clue 1 says the tea drinker lives in the third house. So, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house. But we already know the person with tulips lives in the second house. So, the person who is eating kiwis must be the person with tulips, and the person who likes blue must be the person with running shoes in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person with running shoes lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house. But we already know the person with tulips lives in the second house, and the person with tulips is eating kiwis. So, the person who is wearing boots must be the person who is eating kiwis, and the person who likes green must be the person with tulips in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person with carnations lives in the first house.
- The person with running shoes lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
- The person with tulips lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating apples lives in the second or third house.

From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the third house. Clue 3 says the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other. So, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

"I don't know how to do this. I don't know about all them books. But I can try to figure it out. 

Okay, so first Bob and Dave swap. That means Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave gets Frankenstein. 

Then Bob and Claire swap. That means Bob gets Ulysses and Claire gets Frankenstein. 

Then Dave and Claire swap. That means Dave gets Frankenstein back and Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles. 

Then Claire and Bob swap. That means Claire gets Ulysses back and Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles back. 

So now we know Bob has Hound of the Baskervilles, Claire has Ulysses, and Dave has Frankenstein. 

Finally, Alice and Eve swap. We don't know what they have yet. But we know Alice had The Pearl at the start. 

So let's think about it. If Alice and Eve swap, that means Alice gets Moby Dick and Eve gets The Pearl. 

So, Alice has Moby Dick. The answer is (E)."

We know that in step 3, Bob was dancing with Jamie, and in step 5, Eve was dancing with Rodrigo. So, in step 4, Eve was dancing with Melissa, and in step 3, Dave was dancing with Jamie. So, in step 2, Dave was dancing with Helga, and in step 1, Eve was dancing with Dave. So, in the beginning, Eve was dancing with Jamie.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. Fred and Alice swap gifts. Fred has a purple present and Alice has a white present. Now, Fred has the white present and Alice has the purple present.

2. Eve and Claire swap gifts. Eve has a green present and Claire has a black ball. Now, Eve has the black ball and Claire has the green present.

3. Dave and Bob swap gifts. Dave has a yellow present and Bob has an orange ball. Now, Dave has the orange ball and Bob has the yellow present.

4. Gertrude and Alice swap gifts. Gertrude has a pink ball and Alice has a purple present. Now, Gertrude has the purple present and Alice has the pink ball.

5. Eve and Bob swap gifts. Eve has a black ball and Bob has a yellow present. Now, Eve has the yellow present and Bob has the black ball.

6. Eve and Gertrude swap gifts. Eve has a yellow present and Gertrude has a purple present. Now, Eve has the purple present and Gertrude has the yellow present.

7. Dave and Bob swap gifts. Dave has an orange ball and Bob has a black ball. Now, Dave has the black ball and Bob has the orange ball.

Now, let's see who has what. Alice has a pink ball, Bob has an orange ball, Claire has a green present, Dave has a black ball, Eve has a purple present, Fred has a white present, and Gertrude has a yellow present.

The correct answer is (G) white present."
"Let's figure dis out. 

First, Bob and Claire swap books. So now Bob has Fellowship of the Ring and Claire has The Great Gatsby.

Then, Dave and Bob swap books. So now Dave has The Great Gatsby and Bob has The Pearl.

Next, Claire and Fred swap books. So now Claire has Lolita and Fred has The Great Gatsby.

Then, Claire and Dave swap books. So now Claire has The Pearl and Dave has Lolita.

After that, Fred and Eve swap books. So now Eve has Lolita and Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles.

Then, Alice and Dave swap books. So now Alice has Lolita and Dave has Ulysses.

Finally, Fred and Gertrude swap books. So now Fred has Catch-22 and Gertrude has Hound of the Baskervilles.

Now, let's see who has what. Alice has Ulysses, Bob has The Pearl, Claire has The Pearl, Dave has Hound of the Baskervilles, Eve has Lolita, Fred has Catch-22, and Gertrude has The Great Gatsby.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. Bob and Alice swap gifts. Bob gets the white present, and Alice gets the black ball.
2. Dave and Fred swap gifts. Dave gets the green present, and Fred gets the blue present.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap gifts. Alice gets the purple present, and Gertrude gets the black ball.
4. Alice and Eve swap gifts. Alice gets the orange ball, and Eve gets the purple present.
5. Bob and Claire swap gifts. Bob gets the brown present, and Claire gets the black ball.
6. Dave and Bob swap gifts. Dave gets the black ball, and Bob gets the blue present.
7. Fred and Eve swap gifts. Fred gets the purple present, and Eve gets the green present.

Now, let's see who has what at the end of the event. 
- Alice has the orange ball.
- Bob has the blue present.
- Claire has the black ball.
- Dave has the black ball.
- Eve has the green present.
- Fred has the purple present.
- Gertrude has the white present.

So, Bob has the blue present. The answer is (F)."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. Fred and Claire switch partners. So, Claire is now dancing with Fred, and Fred is dancing with the person Claire was dancing with, which is Melissa.

4. Gertrude and Fred switch partners. So, Gertrude is now dancing with Fred, and Fred is dancing with the person Gertrude was dancing with, which is Melissa.

5. Alice and Bob switch partners. So, Alice is now dancing with Helga again, and Bob is dancing with the person Alice was dancing with, which is Helga, but since Helga is already dancing with Alice, Bob is dancing with the person Helga was dancing with, which is Alice, but since Alice is dancing with Bob, Bob is dancing with the person Alice was dancing with, which is Helga, but since Helga is already dancing with Alice, Bob is dancing with the person Helga was dancing with, which is Alice, but since Alice is dancing with Bob, this is a contradiction. So, let's rephrase it: Alice and Bob switch partners. So, Alice is now dancing with Helga, and Bob is dancing with the person Alice was dancing with, which is Helga, but since Helga is already dancing with Alice, Bob is dancing with the person Helga was dancing with, which is Alice, but since Alice is dancing with Bob, Bob is dancing with the person Alice was dancing with, which is Helga. So, Bob is dancing with Helga.

6. Alice and Fred switch partners. So, Alice is now dancing with Melissa, and Fred is dancing with the person Alice was dancing with, which is Helga.

7. Fred and Claire switch partners. So, Fred is now dancing with Claire, and Claire is dancing with the person Fred was dancing with, which is Melissa.

Now, let's look at the final partners of the people we are interested in. Gertrude is dancing with Fred, and Fred is dancing with Claire."

Now, let's look at the final positions. We know that Fred is not the goalkeeper, striker, fullback, or cheerleader. He is not the left winger because he was the right winger in step 3, and he is not the right winger because he was the cheerleader in step 4. He is not the right midfielder because Eve is the right midfielder in step 7. Therefore, the only position left for Fred is the right midfielder. 

The answer is (F) right midfielder."

7. Gertrude and Dave swap gifts. Gertrude has the white present, and Dave has the brown present. Now, Gertrude has the brown present, and Dave has the white present.

Now, let's see who has what. Alice has the orange ball, Bob has the red present, Claire has the pink ball, Dave has the white present, Eve has the blue present, Fred has the black ball, and Gertrude has the brown present.

The answer is (D) orange ball."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. Alice and Bob trade positions. 
   - Alice is now fullback.
   - Bob is now left winger.

2. Dave and Eve trade positions. 
   - Dave is now benchwarmer.
   - Eve is now right winger.

3. Fred and Bob trade positions. 
   - Fred is now left winger.
   - Bob is now cheerleader.

4. Alice and Eve trade positions. 
   - Alice is now right winger.
   - Eve is now fullback.

5. Claire and Fred trade positions. 
   - Claire is now cheerleader.
   - Fred is now center midfielder.

6. Claire and Bob trade positions. 
   - Claire is now cheerleader is incorrect, Claire is now fullback.
   - Bob is now center midfielder.

7. Bob and Gertrude trade positions. 
   - Bob is now left midfielder.
   - Gertrude is now fullback.

At the end of the match, Gertrude is playing fullback."
"Let's figure dis out. 

First, Alice and Claire trade positions. So, Alice is now left winger and Claire is center midfielder.

Then, Gertrude and Bob trade positions. So, Gertrude is now striker and Bob is benchwarmer.

Next, Eve and Alice trade positions. So, Eve is now center midfielder and Alice is fullback.

Then, Claire and Fred trade positions. So, Claire is now right winger and Fred is center midfielder.

After that, Gertrude and Dave trade positions. So, Gertrude is now cheerleader and Dave is striker.

Next, Eve and Fred trade positions. So, Eve is now right winger and Fred is center midfielder.

Finally, Fred and Bob trade positions. So, Fred is now striker and Bob is right winger.

Now, let's see where Claire is. Claire is right winger."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. Alice and Fred swap balls. Alice has the green ball, and Fred has the yellow ball.
2. Gertrude and Fred swap balls. Gertrude has the green ball, and Fred has the brown ball.
3. Bob and Dave swap balls. Bob has the white ball, and Dave has the red ball.
4. Alice and Bob swap balls. Alice has the white ball, and Bob has the green ball.
5. Claire and Fred swap balls. Claire has the brown ball, and Fred has the black ball.
6. Claire and Gertrude swap balls. Claire has the green ball, and Gertrude has the brown ball.
7. Alice and Eve swap balls. Alice has the blue ball, and Eve has the white ball.

So, at the end of the game, Eve has the white ball. The answer is (B)."
"I don't know how this works. I think I need a piece of paper and a pencil to figure this out. Let me try. 

Okay, so first, Alice and Gertrude trade positions. That means Alice is now on the left winger and Gertrude is cheerleader.

Then, Dave and Claire trade positions. That means Dave is now fullback and Claire is striker.

Next, Bob and Fred trade positions. That means Bob is now right midfielder and Fred is right winger.

Then, Fred and Alice trade positions. That means Fred is now cheerleader and Alice is right winger.

After that, Gertrude and Fred trade positions. That means Gertrude is now right midfielder and Fred is cheerleader.

Then, Dave and Bob trade positions. That means Dave is now right midfielder and Bob is fullback.

Finally, Claire and Eve trade positions. That means Claire is now benchwarmer and Eve is striker.

Now, let's see where Fred is. Fred was cheerleader, then right winger, then cheerleader, then right winger, then cheerleader, then right midfielder, then cheerleader, then right midfielder. He's been cheerleader three times and right midfielder twice. He's not on the left winger, fullback, or striker. So, the answer is (F) right midfielder."
"Let's figure dis out. 

First, Fred and Dave swap books. So now Fred has The Odyssey and Dave has Frankenstein.

Then, Eve and Fred swap books. So now Eve has Frankenstein and Fred has The Pearl.

Then, Gertrude and Bob swap books. So now Gertrude has The Great Gatsby and Bob has Ulysses.

Then, Alice and Bob swap books. So now Alice has Ulysses and Bob has Moby Dick.

Then, Eve and Bob swap books. So now Eve has Moby Dick and Bob has Frankenstein.

Then, Dave and Alice swap books. So now Dave has Ulysses and Alice has The Odyssey.

Finally, Fred and Claire swap books. So now Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles and Claire has The Pearl.

Now, let's see who has what. We know Gertrude has The Great Gatsby."
"I don't know much about soccer, but I can try to figure it out. Let's go through the trades one by one.

1. Bob and Alice trade positions. So, Bob is now on the bench, and Alice is on the field as right winger.
2. Dave and Eve trade positions. So, Dave is now on the left midfielder, and Eve is on the cheerleader.
3. Gertrude and Eve trade positions. So, Gertrude is now on the cheerleader, and Eve is on the striker.
4. Fred and Bob trade positions. So, Fred is now on the bench, and Bob is on the left winger.
5. Claire and Fred trade positions. So, Claire is now on the left winger, and Fred is on the fullback.
6. Gertrude and Alice trade positions. So, Gertrude is now on the bench, and Alice is on the striker.
7. Dave and Fred trade positions. So, Dave is now on the fullback, and Fred is on the cheerleader.

Now, let's see where Eve is. Eve was on the striker in step 3, and then Dave and Fred traded positions in step 7. But Dave and Eve traded positions in step 2, so Eve was on the cheerleader in step 2. And then Gertrude and Eve traded positions in step 3, so Eve was on the striker in step 3. And then Dave and Fred traded positions in step 7, but that doesn't affect Eve. So, Eve is on the striker. 

The answer is (F) striker."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. Eve and Claire switch partners. Eve is now with Helga, and Claire is with Eve's original partner, which is Melissa.

2. Dave and Fred switch partners. Dave is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Dave's original partner, which is Ophelia.

3. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now with Melissa, and Claire is with Alice's original partner, which is Lola.

6. Dave and Eve switch partners. Dave is now with Karl, and Eve is with Dave's original partner, which is Rodrigo.

7. Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Fred is now with Helga, and Gertrude is with Fred's original partner, which is Ophelia.

Now, let's find out who Fred is dancing with at the end of the dance. From step 7, we know that Fred is now with Helga."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Bob and Fred switch partners. So, Bob is now dancing with Helga, and Fred is dancing with Melissa.

Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. So, Gertrude is now dancing with Eve's old partner, Izzi, and Eve is dancing with Gertrude's old partner, Ophelia.

Now, Fred and Bob switch partners again. So, Fred is now dancing with Helga's old partner, Melissa, and Bob is dancing with Helga.

Then, Claire and Fred switch partners. So, Claire is now dancing with Melissa, and Fred is dancing with Lola.

Next, Alice and Bob switch partners. So, Alice is now dancing with Helga, and Bob is dancing with Karl.

Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. So, Claire is now dancing with Karl, and Bob is dancing with Melissa.

Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners. So, Bob is now dancing with Rodrigo, and Dave is dancing with Karl.

Now, let's figure out who Fred is dancing with. We know that Fred is dancing with Lola after Claire and Fred switch partners. Then, Bob and Fred switch partners, but that doesn't change Fred's partner. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners again, but that also doesn't change Fred's partner. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners, and then Claire and Bob switch partners, but neither of those changes Fred's partner. Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners, but that doesn't change Fred's partner either. So, Fred is still dancing with Lola. 

The answer is (C) Lola."

"I don't know much about soccer, but I can try to figure it out. Let's go through the trades one by one.

2. Fred and Claire trade positions. This means Fred is no longer right winger, and Claire is no longer left midfielder. But I still don't know what they are now.

3. Gertrude and Eve trade positions. This means Gertrude is no longer fullback, and Eve is no longer left winger. But I still don't know what they are now.

4. Bob and Alice trade positions. This means Bob is no longer cheerleader, and Alice is no longer whatever she was after the first trade. But I still don't know what they are now.

5. Bob and Gertrude trade positions. This means Bob is no longer whatever he was after the fourth trade, and Gertrude is no longer whatever she was after the third trade. But I still don't know what they are now.

6. Gertrude and Alice trade positions. This means Gertrude is no longer whatever she was after the fifth trade, and Alice is no longer whatever she was after the fourth trade. But I still don't know what they are now.

7. Eve and Bob trade positions. This means Eve is no longer whatever she was after the third trade, and Bob is no longer whatever he was after the sixth trade. But I still don't know what they are now.

However, we do know that Fred was playing right winger at the start of the match. We also know that he traded positions with Claire in the second trade. So, after the second trade, Fred was playing left midfielder. We don't know what happened to him after that, but we do know that he didn't trade positions with anyone else. Therefore, Fred is still playing left midfielder.

The answer is (E) left midfielder."
